Some of these cells are then reverting to normally suppressed behaviors such as mobility and invasion as well as resistance to cell death. In the process, cells also lose ability to organize themselves into sheets and other structures common in normal tissue.  This process is known as the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). Motivated by this example, the investigators developed an experimental model of one type of EMT and, along with biological experiments, are now able to reproduce some features of EMT in computers, i.e., to model the EMT mathematically.  In the current project, the investigators pursue research based on these preliminary results.  These experiments and computer models give rise to a better understanding of signaling processes and, in some cases, leads to better predictions of the effect of treatments on behavior of cancer cells, thus helping advance the fight against cancer.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the objective of the proposed research is multidisciplinary and multiscale analysis of the Epithelial Mesenchymal Transformation (EMT).  EMT is the process by which epithelial cells reversibly lose baso-apical polarity and cell-cell junctions, acquiring plasticity, mobility, invasivity, stem-cell characteristics, and resistance to apoptosis.  This mechanism is important in embryogenesis, as well as in wound healing and in cancer metastasis.  The investigators are particularly interested in the role of NF-kB and p53 and their crosstalk in cancer-related (type III) EMT.  The goal is to build a mathematical model that will relate signal transduction pathways to changes in cell behavior, focusing on observing and modeling cell motility.  An experimental system is developed to measure motility and proliferation using the new Cell Tracker software and Lineage Tracker for quantitation.  Gene expression and flow cytometry measurements will be included. Preliminary data show activation of the NFkB pathway increases motility.  Results of the project can be used to reduce cellular invasion in epithelial malignancies, or sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.  Although the current study has a basic nature, the resulting insights will inform biomedically oriented applications."

Mesenchymal stem cells have self-renewal properties.  These cells have great potential in cell-based therapies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.  However, the fundamental mechanisms of how mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into cells that make formation remains poorly understood.  This project will systematically study the interactions of biophysical and biochemical factors that affect differentiation.  This work will use a novel micro-engineered platform to identify the functions and mechanisms that influence mesenchymal stem cell differentiation.  The educational activities will provide a goal-oriented, project-based, hands-on learning experience to a broad audience, with an emphasis on women and underrepresented minorities.  Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained through project-based courses and research opportunities.  In addition, summer outreach activities will increase teachers' awareness of STEM careers and enhance the engagement of K-12 students into STEM education.  By improving the fundamental understanding of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, this project will support the development of biomanufacturing and tissue engineering systems to produce specific stem cell lineage that are necessary for normal organ function. <br/><br/>The specific research goal of this project is to identify the function and mechanisms of mechanosensitive non-coding RNAs in regulating osteogenic differentiation.  The overarching focus is to investigate how stiffness, geometric guidance, and traction force regulate non-coding RNAs during mesenchymal stem cell differentiation, using a novel multiplex nanobiosensor, 2D and 3D culture systems.  This will be accomplished through three research objectives.  The first objective is to develop and characterize a novel multiplex nanobiosensor for non-coding RNAs detection at the single cell level.  The second objective is to elucidate the mechanosensitive role of non-coding RNAs and their crosstalk with biophysical factors at the tissue, cell, and molecular level.  The final objective is to investigate the mechanoregulation of non-coding RNAs during osteogenic differentiation in 3D microenvironments.  Completion of this project will provide novel information and insights regarding the mechanisms underlying non-coding RNAs in response to biophysical factors.  The knowledge gained from these experiments will provide new insights into the fundamental principles of mechanoregulation of osteogenic differentiation for the application of cell-based therapies, which will support the advancement of the biomanufacturing and tissue engineering systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award is cofounded by the Global Venture Funds in the Office of International Science and Engineering. Cartilage injuries account for nearly half a million surgical procedures performed each year, yet mounting evidence suggests that current interventions provide insufficient long-term benefits. Even as scientists uncover precisely how to regenerate cartilage tissue using mesenchymal stem cells, their routine clinical applications will still require a robust implantation process that retains the cells where desired and provides an environment that promotes repair. The overall goal of this project is to develop an injectable hydrogel that can be used for the encapsulation of mesenchymal stem cells and that can also withstand the mechanically demanding environment after placement in a joint.  To accomplish these objectives, this research will be designing double-network hydrogels by incorporating two types of polymer networks that give rise to hydrogels that are tough and at same time support the encapsulation and differentiation of viable cells.  The project will incorporate educational programs, and will involve students at various levels in the research activities.  The scientific broader impact of the project is to both promote the progress of science through the design and investigation of novel hydrogels and at the same time to advance the national health by improving on our knowledge base of new treatments that can be used for biomedical applications in the future.<br/><br/>Technical: The overall goal of this project is to develop double-network hydrogels to encapsulate and control the chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Double-network (DN) hydrogels exhibit high strength and toughness, and mechanical features that may be desirable for application in cartilage defects and repair. However, at present there are no hydrogels that exist that are both injectable and bio-compatible.  The specific aims of the project include: 1) synthesis of a series of double network hydrogels, and elucidate the structure-property relationships; and 2) assess mesenchymal stem cells survival and chondrogenesis within the double-network hydrogels. The proposed design involves the combination of covalently crosslinked hydrogels based on hyaluronic acid and poly(ethylene glycol) with fibrinogen to permit enzymatic degradability, as well as a self-assembled dynamic network based on biopolymers modified with guest-host groups that are dynamic and self-healing.  This design incorporates the requisite rigid and ductile networks that are encompassed within DN hydrogels that are injectable based on the physical guest-host interactions and then covalently crosslinked through a photopolymerization reaction.  The hydrogel properties will be tailored through alterations in the ratio and composition of each network with a focus on encapsulated mesenchymal stem cell viability and chondrogenesis as outcomes, in addition to desirable hydrogel mechanical properties. Upon successful completion, this work will identify fundamental understanding of hydrogel technology, as well as develop a potentially translational hydrogel for mesenchymal stem cells-based therapeutics for further investigations and biomedical applications."

Since mammalian cells are significantly influenced by their physical environment, the incorporation of tailored nanostructured surfaces into tissue culture devices has great potential to enhance stem cell engineering by more effectively mimicking in vivo situations.   The approach taken will be to utilize nanoscale injection molding to reliably and economically produce cell culture devices designed specifically for each cell phenotype of choice. Fully approved biocompatible polymers will be used, and molded surface features throughout the study will range from the sub-micron scale down to as small as 50 nanometers.  Human mesenchymal stem cells will be studied initially, with other stem cell types included as the work evolves.<br/><br/>If successful, the benefits of this research will include the development of a practical and more effective route to optimally develop human stem cells for a wide range of medical applications.  This would dramatically enhance the international position of U.S. based bioengineering firms active in this field.  In addition, the fully coupled advancement of biomedical science with nanomanufacturing science will establish a new paradigm for approaching bioengineering challenges.  This will benefit both the manufacturing community that needs to direct nanoscale manufacturing science advancements toward appropriate applications and the biomedical community that has so many important problems to solve.  The research will also bolster the development of the future scientific workforce through the inclusion of a significant number of middle and high school students in the work each year.

An intricate network of more than 100 regulatory genes is known to be involved at the top level. The role of this ""managerial"" network, however, is primarily to make decisions, not to do any of the actual work. It was recently discovered that proper development requires that a small group of cells in the embryo send a message to another group, the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs), using a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). PMCs are the cells that lay down the skeleton, and once given the word, they do this pretty much on their own. The research team hopes to learn how PMCs respond to the ""go""-signal they receive from other cells, what genetic programs they run that affect the shape of the skeleton, and what kind of behavioral and structural changes result from running these programs. In the big picture, this would help understand how top-level decisions in the cell lead to actual changes in cell behavior and the emergence of a skeleton with complex architecture, and will hopefully contribute to an understanding of how such mechanisms evolve. An important part of the proposed activities is the development of lab modules for undergraduate engineering students, the integration of undergraduate researchers in the project, and outreach activities at local high schools using a mobile sea urchin lab.<br/><br/>Spiculogenesis in the sea urchin embryo, i.e. formation of the endoskeleton by primary mesenchyme cells (PMC), is the result of a stereotypical sequence of morphogenetic events. Key steps include an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, patterning, and cell-cell fusion. In the late gastrula stage, PMC syncytia begin secreting the endoskeleton. While the current model of the skeletogenic gene regulatory network (GRN) is arguably one of the best understood in any organism, there is currently a gap in our understanding of how the high-level GRN circuitry is integrated with regulation of complex cellular behavior. Recent work identified the importance of ectoderm-derived factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The Principal Investigator and collaborators discovered that a recombinant VEGF has a dramatic concentration-dependent effect on the shape of spicules deposited by PMC in vitro. Triradiates, i.e. branching spicules that closely resemble those initially deposited in the embryo, require a threshold concentration of rVEGF. Below this concentration, markedly different spicule shapes are formed. VEGF is, thus, an important extrinsic regulator of morphogenetic events in PMC. The research team will therefore perform a series of in vitro experiments that aim to unravel the role of VEGF signaling in PMCs. Specifically, they will: a) determine the influence of rVEGF concentration on the skeletogenic GRN and its downstream circuitry by a combination of quantitative PCR and deep sequencing; b) investigate the effect of VEGF on cell behavior before the onset of spiculogenesis, including proliferation, survival, motility, and patterning, and c) study the effect of VEGF on ultrastructure, specifically cytoskeletal rearrangement, in the PMC syncytium. The proposed research will not only help integrate a mechanistic view of PMC skeletal morphogenesis by connecting top-level regulatory circuits with more proximal control over cellular behavior, but also provide a basis for understanding how such regulatory networks evolve to give rise to different morphological features.  Since VEGF is also a key player in the development of vascular, nervous, and tracheal networks, this research may help discern functions of this ligand during evolution. An important part of the proposed activities is the development of lab modules that cast sea urchin skeletal morphogenesis in the context of an entry-level chemical and biological engineering/materials science class, the integration of undergraduate researchers in the project, and outreach activities at local high schools using a mobile sea urchin lab."

It has been estimated that nearly half of all deaths in the western world can be attributed to fibrosis. Fibrosis occurs in nearly every organ, including liver, kidney, heart, skin, and lung. While it is well appreciated that fibrosis is associated with organ failure in many disease states, there are few treatments that have proven successful. This award will support fundamental work in this area by studying the mechanobiology of fibrosis. Mechanobiology is a growing field in which researchers investigate the role of mechanical properties of cells and tissues in disease progression. The research team hypothesize that fibrosis proceeds by initially increasing the stiffness of the tissue, which then leads to the generation of larger contractile forces in local cells, which in turn drives the assembly of more stiff fibrotic tissue, resulting in uncontrolled progression of fibrosis. This research has the potential to discover important insights in fibrosis treatment by investigating the mechanical signaling that underlies fibrosis progression.<br/> <br/>While there are tissue-specific aspects of fibrosis, there are several common themes that are seen regardless of tissue type or disease: cells at the site of fibrosis generate larger contractile forces, they secrete increased levels of extracellular matrix proteins, and they have elevated activation of the Transforming Growth Factor-beta pathway, which is implicated in many diseases, but is also critical in wound healing. Progression of fibrosis drives tissue stiffening, which ultimately disturbs tissue structure and impairs organ function. The research team hypothesizes that these common events are integrated through cell-driven assembly of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin into elastic fibrils. These fibrils are assembled in response to cell-generated contractile forces and possess a growth-factor binding site that binds several growth factors, including Transforming Growth Factor-beta, with nanomolar affinity. The research team will investigate the hypothesis that fibronectin fibrils facilitate fibrosis by both increasing tissue stiffness in fibrotic tissue and localizing Transforming Growth Factor-beta to the cell surface via tethering to fibronectin fibrils. The team will investigate this hypothesis through the use of microfabricated pillar arrays that can quantify both cell-generated contractile forces and assembly of fibronectin fibrils. A novel tool will also be developed to quantify the stiffness of in vitro assembled extracellular matrix."

One source of activated fibroblasts is endothelial to mesenchymal transformation (EndMT), which is the differentiation of mature endothelial cells into mesenchymal cells. EndMT was first observed in embryonic heart valve development, but recent studies have shown that mesenchymal transformation can also occur in wound healing, cancer, cardiac fibrosis, and calcific aortic valve disease. The mechanisms and functional role of EndMT in adult applications, especially in response to tissue mechanics, have not been fully investigated. This award supports fundamental research on the role of mechanobiology on EndMT in aortic heart valves. Determining the cellular and tissue-level conditions that lead to EndMT, and how mesenchymally transformed cells promote disease, will provide an understanding of how aortic valves calcify and fill an unmet need in cardiovascular medicine. More broadly, this work will provide better methods for understanding fibrotic disease, cancer metastasis, and biomaterial design. This research requires expertise from several fields including tissue engineering, biomechanics, and computational biology; and this multidisciplinary approach will be integrated to promote graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 science and engineering education.<br/><br/>EndMT has been observed in human valves near calcified nodules, and factors present in aortic valve disease including inflammatory cytokines, pathological cyclic strain, and altered shear stress have individually been shown to induce cell transformation in adult aortic valve endothelial cells. Preliminary work has also shown that extracellular matrix composition mimicking diseased valve conditions strongly stimulates mesenchymal transformation and calcification. No studies to date have linked the degree of EndMT to valve calcification. The research team will engineer novel cell culture models and hybrid stochastic/continuum computational models to test the hypothesis that the activated fibroblasts generated from EndMT promote valve matrix remodeling, inflammatory cytokine release, and calcified nodule formation. The research objectives are to characterize the extracellular matrix-aortic valve endothelial cell interactions that impact EndMT and determine if mesenchymally transformed cells promote calcification, and to predict mesenchymally transformed cell evolution and growth using hybrid computational models. The long-term goal of this research program is to develop tools that can (1) determine the factors that promote or inhibit EndMT and its subsequent effects and (2) provide a platform for investigating therapeutic interventions, which could have a major impact on the technology available to scientists and lead to novel treatments for human disease."

Coordinated movements of loosely-packed mesenchymal cells in the early embryo construct the vertebrate body plan and populate tissues in preparation for the construction of muscles, connective tissue and bone, as well as the lymphatic and circulatory systems. Many genes and many cells participate in these events, but there is little experimental evidence on how genes and cells generate physical forces and integrate biochemical pathways to drive mechanical movements within embryos. The goal of this research is to investigate how genes control the physical mechanics of multicellular mesenchymal tissues by: 1) analyzing the physics of re-aggregation and the cellular mechanics responsible for rapid phases of tissue sculpting, 2) challenging cells with varied micro-environments and assessing how their behavior changes, and 3)vary levels of cell adhesion molecules and surface contractility to reveal how mesenchymal tissue spreading and engulfment are mechanically coordinated. Understanding the molecular basis of rules governing the ordered assembly of mesenchymal tissue will explain how events at the subcellular scale coordinate cell behaviors during assembly of organs and functional tissues. These findings will complement and extend efforts to understand the molecular basis of mesenchymal morphogenesis and begin the process of integrating the molecular machinery into larger ""morphogenetic"" processes that are robust and may be adapted by tissue engineers.

There are numerous examples in development in which cells undergo a transition from an epithelial (strongly adherent) state to a mesenchymal (weakly adherent) state, and vice versa. Clearly, an understanding of how such epithelia/mesenchymal transitions are regulated is necessary for a proper understanding of tissue formation in embryogenesis. Epithelial/mesenchymal transitions generally result from inductive events in the embryo, so signal transduction via cell surface receptors is likely to play a role in the process. Pagliaccio (Pag) is an Eph-class receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) that is expressed in Xenopus embryos in a highly localized set of tissues, including a subset of cranial neural crest cells, which are mesenchymal in nature. When Pag catalytic activity is activated ectopically in early embryos, cells disaggregate. The hypothesis to be tested in the proposed project is that the normal function of Pag in Xenopus embryos is to negatively regulate cell adhesion, thereby playing a role in effecting epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. The hypothesis will be tested by examining the cellular effects of Pag catalytic activity. Experiments will be performed to determine whether epithelial cells (both in culture and in embryos) in which Pag has been activated adopt a mesenchymal phenotype, express mesenchymal-specific markers, and exhibit a rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton."

Although uncontrolled cell division is a hallmark of tumor formation, the spread of cancer cells from a primary tumor to other organs, i.e. metastasis, is the key feature that leads to high mortality rates. During metastasis, epithelial cancer cells detach from the primary tumor site and acquire a highly motile and/or mesenchymal phenotype. Migration/invasion of these cells into surrounding tissue and the circulatory/lymphatic system leads to colonization of distal tissues and secondary tumor formation. The central biological mechanism responsible for metastasis is known as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition to its role in cancer metastasis, EMT is a fundamental biological process that plays an important role in embryonic development, wound healing and organ fibrosis. During EMT polarized epithelial cells undergo dramatic biochemical and biostructural changes and acquire a mesenchymal phenotype with enhanced migratory and invasive capacity. Although many of the biochemical signaling events that occur during oncogenic EMT are known, the biomechanical mechanisms governing oncogenic EMT are not well established. Furthermore, although it is well established that the tumor microenvironment can influence cancer progression and that increased tumor stiffness is a diagnostic indicator of advanced disease, there is limited information about how changes in the tumor?s biomechanical properties (i.e. matrix stiffness) influence EMT and metastatic potential.<br/><br/>This proposal utilizes a combination of biophysical, molecular biology and quantitative engineering tools to investigate the biomechanical mechanisms governing oncogenic EMT and to investigate how changes tissue/matrix mechanics influences EMT and metastasis. Sophisticated experimental techniques will be used to characterize changes in cellular mechanics during EMT in different cancer cells. Several biomechanical markers of EMT (i.e. stiffness, viscoelasticity and contractility) will be correlated with cell migration and invasion behaviors. In addition to establishing a unique set of biomechanical markers of EMT, these studies will also provide an innovative way to quantitatively assess metastatic potential based on the cell's mechanical phenotype. Experimental techniques will also be used to investigate how changes in substrate/matrix stiffness influence the biomechanical and biochemical signaling mechanisms responsible for oncogenic EMT. Finally, three-dimensional multi-scale computational models of tumor cell detachment and migration/invasion will be developed and these computational models will be used to develop new insights into how changes in cell mechanics may be used to mitigate metastasis. The proposed research studies will provide training for a post-doctoral research scientist and undergraduate/graduate students in biomedical engineering at The Ohio State University and will also be integrated into an undergraduate course in quantitative physiology.

A major challenge to realizing the therapeutic potential of these adult stem cells is their rapid depletion upon implantation at the site of tissue injury.  MSCs exhibit significant cell-to-cell variation in their capacity to survive upon implantation, but the molecular basis for this heterogeneity is poorly understood. The objective of this project is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity in MSC survival.  This project helps to fulfill NSF's mission to advance the progress of science by generating fundamental knowledge about MSC survival at the molecular level. This knowledge has the potential to advance the stem cell field by developing novel methods to improve MSC survival. Greater MSC survival will overcome a critical barrier to achieve more effective MSC therapies.  This study is broadly relevant to other types of stem cells inasmuch as all stem cells are inherently heterogeneous.<br/><br/>This project addresses a critical need to improve the survival of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) upon implantation. Rapid depletion of the majority of implanted MSCs impedes their ability to regenerate tissue upon engraftment. The PI has detected considerable cell-to-cell variation in MSC survival. The objective of this proposal is to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity in MSC survival. The central hypothesis is that MSCs are an ensemble of distinct cell subsets with different capacity to survive due to differential expression of key signaling molecules.  This project is innovative in exploiting cellular heterogeneity to obtain unique insight into MSC survival on a molecular level.  Aim 1 will evaluate a novel cell-surface marker of MSC survival in vivo, using a xenoimplantation assay to quantify survival kinetics.  Aim 2 will employ bioinformatics to identify the first genome-wide gene signature of MSC survival, which will culminate in a binary classification model to predict MSC survival.  This research is anticipated to develop novel molecular-based strategies to increase survival.  Improving MSC survival is expected to have a positive impact on the therapeutic efficacy of engrafted MSCs.  In addition, complementary educational activities will contribute to the training of a diverse STEM workforce, including students underrepresented in STEM fields. The project will provide interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students through a unique bioengineering curriculum and collaborative research, a hands-on laboratory experience with stem cells for middle school students, and other outreach activities. Project results will be broadly disseminated to students, scholars and the general public.<br/>This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of CBET is co-funded by the Mathematical Biology Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences."

MSCs are a promising source of adult stem cells for bone formation (osteogenesis) and are composed of a mixture of highly regenerative and more lineage-committed cells.  At present, the underlying heterogeneity of MSCs is generally not considered in the development of cellular bone therapies with implanted MSCs and molecular therapies to augment bone formation by MSCs.  This project challenges the current approach by suggesting that the extent of osteogenesis in a heterogeneous MSC culture is a function of its cellular composition and molecular crosstalk among the cell populations.  At the cellular level, an objective of this project is to develop a method to enrich highly regenerative MSCs to enable consistent and rapid production of effective MSC therapies to treat bone defects and other disorders.  At the molecular level, computational modeling will be employed to resolve a network of Wnt pathways essential to bone formation and, in so doing, identify new pharmacological agents to enhance the effectiveness of MSCs to repair damaged bone.  These research objectives are integrated with educational objectives to provide interdisciplinary training for graduate students through a unique bioengineering curriculum and collaborative research; interest high school students in science, technology, engineering and math through outreach programs sponsored by Tulane University; include underrepresented groups in these endeavors, and broadly disseminate project results to students, scholars and the public at large."

While teeth have been missing from Aves for nearly 100 million years, in the avian oral cavity there does exist a residual structure resembling the tooth rudiment at the lamina stage in reptiles and mammals. This arrest of tooth development in Aves is believed to be due to the failed interactions between the presumptive dental epithelium and mesenchyme. A similar phenotype is observed in the mouse Msxl and Msx2 double mutants in which tooth development is also arrested at the lamina stage. To date there is no information available on the arrest of tooth development and its underlying molecular mechanisms in Aves. This proposal is aimed at defining the failure of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the arrest of avian tooth development, with a goal of generating an avian tooth bud in vitro and in viva. In situ hybridization, in vitro tissue recombination, in vitro organ culture will be employed to examine the expression of important genes, to localize the odontogenic defect to the tissue compartment in the chick presumptive tooth germ, and to verify the conservation of signaling pathways in the dental mesenchyme between mouse and chick. A possible conservation of signaling pathways in the formation of tooth and limb will be also verified by replacing chick limb AER with mouse dental epithelium and vice versa. Chick CAM culture and mouse intraocular graft techniques will be used to enhance chick tooth germ development. Effort will also be made to generate a chick tooth germ by restoring gene expression in the chick presumptive tooth germ in vitro and in viva with retroviral infection. The long-term goal of this study is to substantiate our understanding of the molecular basis of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during organogenesis."

These studies have identified a growth inhibitory factor in the conditioned medium from urogenital sinus organ cultures and derived mesenchymal cell lines. In addition, the growth inhibitory activity affects bladder and prostatic epithelial cell lines, suggesting this activity may affect cell differentiation.

This happens when cancer spreads, but also when an embryo grows.  Whether cells can change from ones that move into ones that remain in the same place is partly dependent on the tissue stiffness. If we better understand this change in cells, it will improve our understanding of how cancer progresses and how our organs grow. The change from mobile to a static cells is call mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). MET is important to kidney and heart development, wound healing and cancer metastasis. When MET happens, migrating cells change so that they are immobile and tightly bound to neighboring cells. MET depends on tissue stiffness, but the details of the dependence aren't known. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will measure the response of cells to dynamic changes in matrix stiffness and determine how EMT is affected by tissue stiffness. This will help in understanding how embryos grow, how to better manufacture artificial tissues and in building 'organs on a chip' that can be used for drug discovery research. The PI and graduate student supported through this project will develop and implement a workshop for grade 6-12 teachers focused on biomechanics and mechanobiology concepts so that they can better teach their students, including how engineering research impacts society.     <br/><br/>Mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) is a phenotypic change in which migratory cells with weak cell-cell contacts transition to tightly bound cells exhibiting apical-basal polarity. MET is central to embryonic remodeling, establishment of organ architecture, wound healing, reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells, and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. While it is recognized that mechanical properties of the cellular niche change dynamically during MET-associated processes in vivo, important questions still remain regarding how microenvironmental physical properties regulate MET. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop a dynamic hydrogel system that recapitulates changes in tissue mechanical properties during MET-associated events, and then to use this system to determine the expression of genes associated with epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cell migration. Further studies will elucidate the role of key mechanoresponsive signaling molecules and epigenetic remodeling in regulating MET response to mechanical signals. The establishment of molecular mechanisms linking tissue mechanics and MET will result in a better understanding of mechanotransduction processes and will provide insight into how mechanical signals regulate cell plasticity. The research program provides the foundation for educational and outreach efforts aimed toward incorporating positive themes about the impact of engineering and mechanobiology on society into engineering curricula and into recruitment efforts directed toward grade 6-12 through graduate-level students.

Future advances in regenerative medicine will require the use of more than one peptide or bioactive molecule to drive stem cells into well-defined specifically differentiated populations. While many investigations have focused on individual molecular interactions at discrete concentrations, a complete interactome of the concentration dependence of extra cellular matrix-derived, osteogenic growth peptide and short peptide fragments of bone morphogenic proteins singly and in combination has remained elusive. The gradient approach also affords a method to decouple local signaling that occurs due to cell-integrin interactions from soluble paracrine effects.  When identified, this information will drive the design of higher-order bioactive and biomimetic materials for use in several applications where synthetic materials contact biological systems. The aims of the proposal outline an approach to fabricate and characterize both unidirectional and orthogonal peptide concentration (10-200 pm/cm2 for unidirectional and 10-100 pm/cm2 for orthogonal) gradients.  Using a multidimensional characterization approach with surface spectroscopy, immunohistochemistry, automated fluorescence microscopy and real-time polymerase chain reaction, the project will capture the concentration thresholds and synergistic signaling events that influence cell proliferation, lineage commitment and population heterogeneities.  The multidisciplinary research ecosystem will offer training opportunities to researchers at all levels (high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral) at the cutting edge of materials chemistry, chemical biology and regenerative medicine.  In partnership with a local high school, real world research activities will be incorporated into age-appropriate modules into upper level biology courses and will be used to teach fundamental concepts and relationships between both physics and chemistry.<br/><br/>One of the major remaining barriers to advancing regenerative medicine into mainstream applications is the issue of reliable, safe cell sources.  In the near term, stem cells for surgical implantation must come from the person needing the replacement part (autologous sourcing).  This limitation will require a pre-surgical isolation of stem cells followed by an expansion protocol ex vivo (outside the body) to generate enough stem cells for the scaffold seeding.  The existing synthetic materials are insufficient for these protocols.  This proposal outlines an approach to identify the optimal combinations and concentrations of small biomimetic peptides to yield large quantities of well-defined stem cell populations.  The autologous approach is free of most safety and ethical concerns that have been raised by various populations.  If successful, the identified concentrations will have far reaching impact on our understanding of how individual and combinations of peptides influence cell differentiation and furthermore improve the quantity and quality of well-defined stem cell populations available for research and clinical investigations.  The multidisciplinary research environment offers opportunities for training at all levels (high school, undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral).  The project involves training students, undergraduate, and high school students from a local school.  The age appropriate educational modules will be designed to teach fundamental principles to high school biology courses at various levels using advanced research topics.  It is critical to encourage students at this age to understand the importance of engineering principles and how they relate to advancing human health. This project is expected to support the nation's efforts to increase the numbers and diversity of the engineering student pipeline that require one to reach down and providing unique research opportunities to underrepresented/minority students populations which encourage the pursuit of science and engineering careers."

Growth factors have long been recognized as potent drivers of MSC growth and differentiation. However, recent studies have demonstrated that scaffold stiffness can have a similar degree of influence on MSC differentiation. These findings have opened up the possibility that MSC differentiation can be dictated by tailoring scaffold material properties alone.

These wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the US and this number is growing rapidly due to a drastic increase in the number of diabetics, the obese, and the elderly--all populations in which wound healing is impaired. Mesenchymal stem cells (commonly known as adult stem cells) and insulin applied to wound surfaces have each shown promise in healing otherwise unhealable wounds. Mesenchymal stem cells assist wound healing by secreting factors that promote actions critical to wound healing, such as new blood vessel formation, increases in the production of skin components, and recruitment of cells that clean wounds and form scar tissue. Insulin assists wound healing by recruiting mesenchymal stem cells and skin cells to the wound area.  Motivated by the recent observation that wounds treated with a combination of mesenchymal stem cells and insulin-producing cells healed faster than normal and without scarring, the objective of this project is to identify the type of insulin needed to achieve the observed accelerated healing and reduced scarring and to uncover the wound healing pathways that are recruited.  Research results have the potential to transform wound care by enabling rapid healing that would avert the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic wounds and to enhance reconstructive and plastic surgery outcomes by reducing or eliminating scar formation.  The project's long-term educational goal is to present future engineers with tissue engineering research in unfamiliar contexts, like aviation, to inspire innovative thinking for future careers in biomedical engineering. In pursuit of this goal, this project's educational objective is to apply research principles to teaching and to develop tissue engineering research modules that integrate research, teaching, mentorship, and learning for use in biomedical engineering course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). The educational and outreach approach is to recruit female students, group them in teams and provide hands-on research activities with wound healing models that will enable them to formulate hypotheses and models, and to propose, conduct, and present experiments that will further their understanding of research. The women will be required to present their research in scientific meetings and to K-12 graders in an aviation science club.<br/><br/>The project's research focus is on investigating the impact of mesynchymal stem cells (MSCs) and insulin producing cells (IPCs), both individually and coencapsulated, on wound healing and its pathways, and on identifying how cell-cell vs. cell-wound interactions govern the secretome of encapsulated cells.  The project is motivated by recent studies from the PI's lab that achieved dramatically accelerated (14 vs 40 days), scar-free wound healing after combining these cells.  The research plan has four specific aims.  Aim 1 is to dissect, via in vitro studies, the role of IPCs vs insulin in survival and function of the coencapsulated cells, i.e., whether it is insulin itself, the presence of the IPCs or the hormone release that improves survival and function.  Aim 2 is to dissect, via in vivo studies in mice, the role of IPCs vs insulin in the accelerated wound healing, i. e, whether insulin-producing fibroblasts have the same effect as commercially available IPCs (RIN-5F and RIN-14B) that secrete additional products. Aim 3 is to determine the extent, via in vitro studies, that coencapsulation promotes MSC factor release in comparison to MSC factor release elicited by wound environments, i.e., whether the Akt signaling pathway, which is critical to MSC survival, is activated more strongly in MSCs coencapsulated with IPCs or in MSCs delivered singly to wounds.  Aim 4 is to determine the extent that IPCs+MSCs reduce scar formation, i.e., to extend the work to a limited study in pigs, which have an epidermis and dermis similar to human skin and heal at a comparable rate.  In summary, this project will examine the metabolic pathways involved in IPC+MSC wound healing, the interplay between the two cells and the wound environment, and whether lessons learned can be applied to other cell therapies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Myofibroblasts develop through a transformation from normally occurring fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts play a critical role in physiological and pathophysiological events such as heart valve development, the generation of fibrotic heart tissue, and the formation of calcified aortic valve nodules. These activated cells are able to proliferate, secrete inflammatory and tissue-degrading chemical factors, and remodel the surrounding environment such as the extracellular matrix (ECM). Endothelial to mesenchymal transformation (EndMT), which is the transition of endothelial cells to mesenchymal-like cells, is one source of myofibroblasts. EndMT was first observed in embryonic heart valve development, but more recent studies have shown that EndMT is also observed in tissue-level repair processes -- such as wound healing -- and in adult disease development -- including cancer, cardiac fibrosis, and calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Changes in the endothelial cell mechanical and chemical environment can promote EndMT, but less is known about why these transformed cells can promote tissue regeneration or progression of disease. A primary research goal of this project, which combines experimental and computational modeling methods, is to determine if and how combined mechanical and chemical forces seen in the normal physiological environment direct mesenchymally transformed aortic valve endothelial cells toward disease. The research results will be incorporated into workshops that are designed to enhance K-12 scientific and technological understanding, and this award will also provide graduate and undergraduate educational and professional development opportunities.<br/><br/>The project will test how the composition of the extracellular environment and shear stresses, which occur in vivo due to blood flow, affect mesenchymally-transformed cell behavior in laboratory experiments (in vitro). Additionally, the project will use mathematical modeling and computer simulation to study the ability of EndMT-derived myofibroblasts to restructure the surrounding tissue, their interaction with resident valve interstitial cells, the molecular mechanisms directing these behaviors, and the potential feedback loop of these multiscale mechanisms. This research combines experiments using microfluidic cell culture models of the aortic valve with computational simulation of the transformation, interaction, and migration of cells under different mechanical and chemical environmental conditions. Both the experimental and computational models will mimic cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions in the body, including cell growth, migration, proliferation, and interaction in both healthy and diseased aortic valves. The computational model simulations will enable a more detailed examination of the mechanical and chemical factors most critical to disease progression and provide a means to probe the feedback loop of EndMT and tissue modification, which can only be performed in a limited manner experimentally. Together, the in vitro experiments and computational simulations will provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of CAVD, illuminate the mechanical conditions that lead to regenerative or pathological tissue remodeling, and provide a test-bed for new therapeutic strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These structures are present in most body tissues and they are critical to tissue health. During the process of tissue formation, cell-to-cell and cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions combine to produce organized, functional tissues with EMS. Later in life, however, these tissues have limited capacity to regenerate themselves in response to injury, disease, or aging. Efforts to direct tissue self-structuring and remodeling for medical purposes are progressing, but they are still hampered by not knowing how the interactions between cells and matrix are coordinated biochemically and mechanically to produce a healthy tissue. These interactions are complex and produce behaviors that cannot be easily understood using a simple approach. This research will provide an essential computer model that can incorporate data and observations from different experiments into a unified picture so that basic principles of mechanobiology can be understood and used to help control tissue formation and remodeling. The project is expected to produce new discoveries and insights on the role of physical forces in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in skin. The knowledge gained and tools developed may also be broadly applicable and useful to other parts of the body where EMS occur, such as blood vessels, lungs, intestines, and kidneys. Broader goals of the project include generating more public awareness, understanding, and excitement for how mathematics, engineering, and computer modeling can be used to simplify complex biological processes, particularly those that involve mechanical forces. Research findings from this project will be put into learning modules accessible for young students from K-12 in collaboration with the University of Iowa outreach programs. Research will also be put into undergraduate and graduate biomedical engineering courses, and into a publically accessible and freely downloadable multimedia iBook with live cell imaging and computer simulations.<br/><br/>In vitro time-lapse imaging experiments on keratinocytes and fibroblasts will be used to develop and tune a multi-scale computational model for understanding and predicting how physical forces drive self-structuring and remodeling of EMS in skin.

These wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the US and this number is growing rapidly due to a drastic increase in the number of diabetics, the obese, and the elderly--all populations in which wound healing is impaired. Mesenchymal stem cells (commonly known as adult stem cells) and insulin applied to wound surfaces have each shown promise in healing otherwise unhealable wounds. Mesenchymal stem cells assist wound healing by secreting factors that promote actions critical to wound healing, such as new blood vessel formation, increases in the production of skin components, and recruitment of cells that clean wounds and form scar tissue. Insulin assists wound healing by recruiting mesenchymal stem cells and skin cells to the wound area.  Motivated by the recent observation that wounds treated with a combination of mesenchymal stem cells and insulin-producing cells healed faster than normal and without scarring, the objective of this project is to identify the type of insulin needed to achieve the observed accelerated healing and reduced scarring and to uncover the wound healing pathways that are recruited.  Research results have the potential to transform wound care by enabling rapid healing that would avert the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic wounds and to enhance reconstructive and plastic surgery outcomes by reducing or eliminating scar formation.  The project's long-term educational goal is to present future engineers with tissue engineering research in unfamiliar contexts, like aviation, to inspire innovative thinking for future careers in biomedical engineering. In pursuit of this goal, this project's educational objective is to apply research principles to teaching and to develop tissue engineering research modules that integrate research, teaching, mentorship, and learning for use in biomedical engineering course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). The educational and outreach approach is to recruit female students, group them in teams and provide hands-on research activities with wound healing models that will enable them to formulate hypotheses and models, and to propose, conduct, and present experiments that will further their understanding of research. The women will be required to present their research in scientific meetings and to K-12 graders in an aviation science club.<br/><br/>The project's research focus is on investigating the impact of mesynchymal stem cells (MSCs) and insulin producing cells (IPCs), both individually and coencapsulated, on wound healing and its pathways, and on identifying how cell-cell vs. cell-wound interactions govern the secretome of encapsulated cells.  The project is motivated by recent studies from the PI's lab that achieved dramatically accelerated (14 vs 40 days), scar-free wound healing after combining these cells.  The research plan has four specific aims.  Aim 1 is to dissect, via in vitro studies, the role of IPCs vs insulin in survival and function of the coencapsulated cells, i.e., whether it is insulin itself, the presence of the IPCs or the hormone release that improves survival and function.

This award is cofunded by the Polymer program in the Division of Materials Research. Earlier studies strongly indicate that hMSC phenotype is strongly influenced by ligands derived from the natural cellular microenvironment, including cell adhesion peptides, heparin-binding peptides, and growth factor-mimetic peptides. This proposal is to develop polymer coatings based on copolymers of poly(ethylene glycol) with at most 10% of crosslinkable groups, which can be crosslinked into 30 nm mats for immobilization of peptides.  These mats are chemically-defined for stable presentation of two putative pro-osteogenic peptides over an extended timeframe, and to explore in depth the effects on hMSC differentiation into osteoblasts. These polymer coatings with peptides present a stable cytophobic slate, and hence one can truly investigate the effect of the relevant peptides on hMSCs during the entire time course of osteogenic differentiation. Importantly, these coatings are thin films that can be applied to virtually any underlying substrate, which will lead to broad impact on cell culture studies and future design of biomedical devices. Because of the thin-film nature, the proposed use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy will quantify precisely the peptides presented on the polymer coatings. Further, this proposal will study the first systematic analysis of chemically defined, nanometer-scale presentation of a growth factor-receptor binding ligand, and it may lead to broad impact in view of the importance of receptor dimerization/clustering in virtually all growth factor signaling systems. <br/><br/>The technological broader impact of this proposal would be in developing a new class of ultra-thin biomaterial coatings with unique set of properties for stem cell growth. In order to clearly understand the effects of micro environmental signals on stem cell behavior, there is a critical need for experimental systems that present specific signals, and complex signal combinations, to stem cells. The proposed platform may lead to widespread use of the proposed approaches by cell biologists in general. Ultimately, this line of research could result in identification of signals that promote lineage-specific stem cell differentiation, leading to development and optimization of substrates that promote stem cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. More generally, the proposed adaptable and chemically tailorable thin films would be applicable to a broad range of fundamental questions in cell biology in which stable, controlled presentation of peptide ligands is desirable. As part of this grant, this project will: 1) develop Interdisciplinary Curriculum Development of two courses in two departments, one based in Materials Science & Engineering, and the second one based in Biomedical Engineering; 2) carry out dissemination and outreach activities by the development of hands-on exhibits on Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering that would provide case study materials for a Science and Social Media course; and 3) recruit and mentor female and underrepresented minority graduate and undergraduate students in research activities."

Growth factors are essential in mediating the stages of wound healing, which proceed continuously from the time of epidermal damage to scar tissue formation. Elderly patients and patients suffering from chronic illness develop chronic wounds when the wound healing process is arrested in a state of chronic inflammation. Two of the factors that have been associated with the formation of chronic wounds are: (1) impaired production of growth factors and (2) reduced angiogensis. Cell-based therapies, including fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have previously been used to promote more rapid wound healing; however, the effectiveness of these therapies was limited by poor cell migration and engraftment in the wound bed. The proposed studies will focus on the optimization of MSC migration in the wound bed. It is hypothesized that migrating MSCs that disseminate throughout the wound bed will contribute to the formation of granulation tissue, which will constrict the wound for more rapid wound closure. Improved MSC migration may also improve the spatio-temporal activity of the growth factors since they will be secreted from MSCs disseminated throughout the wound tissue. <br/><br/>Platelet-secreted soluble proteins, such as PDGF and TGF-??, mediate the migration of bone marrow derived cells to wound tissues; however, little is known about the effects of these proteins on the microscopic mechanical properties of MSCs. Using quantitative real-time microscopy techniques, including particle tracking microrheology and time-lapsed fluorescent microscopy, the effects of PDGF, TGF-??, and/or hypoxia on intracellular rheology, cytoskeletal organization, and interaction with cell adhesion molecules will be monitored. In vitro transwell migration studies will be used to measure the effects of selected stimuli on MSC migration. Together these techniques will be used to determine the mechanical and adhesive properties of migratory MSCs. Optimized MSCs, found to possess the mechanical properties associated with increased migration, will be tested in vivo for migration in the wound bed. MSCs will then be genetically engineered to express vascular endothelial growth factor, which will be used to promote more rapid angiogenesis. The proposed studies will generate fundamental information about the effects of platelet secreted soluble proteins on the mechanical and adhesive properties of MSCs. This information will be utilized in the development of MSC-based therapies for wound healing."

It is proposed to develop model platforms that will allow for stable presentation of cell adhesion motifs over an extended time frame, to clearly address the hypothesis: ECM-derived cell adhesion ligands strongly influence osteogenic hMSC differentiation. The synthetic templates for studying cellular interactions, should meet multiple requirements such as: (a) presentation of multiple signals in optimized combinations on a bioinert background, which requires synthetic flexibility, (b) ability to apply to a range of planar and non-planar substrates, (c) stability over extended time period for long differentiating cells, and (d) the ability to spatially localize the signals. The last two requirements would extend the applicability of the template to biomedical implants and devices. UV-crosslinked thin-films (30-50nm) with 2-3 % of crosslinking will be examined.  The intellectual impact of the proposed research is in exploiting the attributes of crosslinked thin-films such as exceptional stability, application to atypical substrates, chemical tailorability to be cytophobic or cytophilic, and photo-patternability for studying long differentiation processes.  The specific tasks that will be undertaken towards this goal are: (a) Materials synthesis of a range of UV-crosslinkable copolymers based on polyethylene glycol copolymers containing a controlled distribution of photo-crosslinkable and ligand (biological signals) groups.  (b) Evaluation of mechanical and chemical stability of the templates by a combination of surface characterization methods and fluorophore tagged peptides.  (c) Study the cell adhesion, growth and differentiation in standard cell culture medium and cell culture medium containing pro-osteogenic supplements.  (d) Evolve methodology to modify a variety of non planar substrates by dipcoating, microcontact printing and use of an ultrasonic microplotter. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  The broader impact of the proposal will be developing a new class of biomaterials coatings with unique set of properties for stem cell studies. In order to clearly understand the effects of microenvironmental signals on stem cell behavior, there is a critical need for experimental systems that present specific signals, and complex signal combinations, to stem cells.

Some of these cells are then reverting to normally suppressed behaviors such as mobility and invasion as well as resistance to cell death. In the process, cells also lose ability to organize themselves into sheets and other structures common in normal tissue.  This process is known as the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). Motivated by this example, the investigators developed an experimental model of one type of EMT and, along with biological experiments, are now able to reproduce some features of EMT in computers, i.e., to model the EMT mathematically.  In the current project, the investigators pursue research based on these preliminary results.  These experiments and computer models give rise to a better understanding of signaling processes and, in some cases, leads to better predictions of the effect of treatments on behavior of cancer cells, thus helping advance the fight against cancer.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, the objective of the proposed research is multidisciplinary and multiscale analysis of the Epithelial Mesenchymal Transformation (EMT).  EMT is the process by which epithelial cells reversibly lose baso-apical polarity and cell-cell junctions, acquiring plasticity, mobility, invasivity, stem-cell characteristics, and resistance to apoptosis.  This mechanism is important in embryogenesis, as well as in wound healing and in cancer metastasis.  The investigators are particularly interested in the role of NF-kB and p53 and their crosstalk in cancer-related (type III) EMT.  The goal is to build a mathematical model that will relate signal transduction pathways to changes in cell behavior, focusing on observing and modeling cell motility.  An experimental system is developed to measure motility and proliferation using the new Cell Tracker software and Lineage Tracker for quantitation.  Gene expression and flow cytometry measurements will be included. Preliminary data show activation of the NFkB pathway increases motility.  Results of the project can be used to reduce cellular invasion in epithelial malignancies, or sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents.

Targeted areas include cardiomyopathy, left ventricular dysfunction, diabetes and immune diseases such as graft-versus-host diseases (GvHD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and multiple schlerosis (MS).  hMSCs are isolated in small numbers from adult donors and are mass-produced for clinical trials by sustained serial expansion in culture. Many studies have shown that sustained culture reduces the potency and clinical potential of hMSCs but the key factors that contribute to the reduced potency are not known. The PI has obtained preliminary results suggesting that metabolism and cell signaling associated with metabolites related to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) may play a central role in controlling the potency of hMSCs in culture. The objective of this project is to investigate the biological changes in NAD metabolism that occur during prolonged expansion, and then use this knowledge to develop new engineering practices that maintain the level of NAD and, therefore, the desired clinical effects. The project will first determine the feasibility and specific treatment strategy and then evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of the treated hMSC in treating an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS). The outcome of this research will be new fundamental knowledge and engineering practices that accelerate the translation of stem cell technology to clinical applications. The project has broader impacts on workforce development by training undergraduate and graduate students in a cross disciplinary research setting covering stem cell biology, cell metabolism, reaction engineering, and process design. This interdisciplinary training is especially important for developing the next generation of bioengineers in cell therapy industry. The analysis of metabolic networks and cellular homeostasis in stem cells will be integrated in the senior chemical reaction engineering course taught by the PI to highlight the application of classical reaction engineering principles in stem cell engineering. The participating laboratories have established collaborations, and are experienced in education of domestic female and minority students. The project, which has an established relationship with an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), is expected to have a significant impact on the recruitment and education of students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.<br/><br/>Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) are the cell of choice in more than half of stem cell therapy and the most clinically-tested cells worldwide. Biomanufacturing of hMSCs requires in vitro expansion which leads to a gradual loss of therapeutic potency, contributing to inconsistent clinical results. The culture-induced changes in hMSC property are accompanied by metabolic shifts and a breakdown in cellular homeostasis as characterized by reduced basal autophagy, telomere attrition, and increased senescence. Published and preliminary studies from the PI's laboratory demonstrate a passage-dependent decrease in the NAD+ concentration, its key role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, and the effectiveness of NAD+-boosting to restore hMSC homeostasis andphenotypic and functional properties in high passage hMSCs. This project will test the hypotheses that: 1) in vitro expansion leads to a metabolic shift and a progressive decrease in NAD+concentration and the NAD+/NADH ratio; 2) these alterations in NAD metabolism lead to abreakdown in cellular homeostasis; and 3) maintaining NAD+ levels during expansion effectively restores mitochondrial potential and cellular homeostasis, thereby preserving the clinically relevant hMSC functions. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms underpinning the changes in hMSC phenotype during expansion and implementation of a metabolic approach to maximize expansion yield while preserving their therapeutic potency will accelerate the translation of hMSC-basedtherapy for clinical applications. The intellectual merit of the project lies in addressing fundamental gaps in our knowledge ofvenergy metabolism in maintaining hMSC homeostasis and functional properties. This gap currently prevents more widespread clinical translation of hMSCs. While metabolism underlies all aspects of cellular events, little is known about its role in regulating hMSC homeostasis and phenotype during large scale expansion. The results of this study will address a significant technological barrier in hMSC biomanufacturing by establishing a metabolic strategy to preserve the therapeutic properties of cultureexpanded hMSCs. Importantly, the metabolic approach is an implementable strategy in large scale MSC manufacturing because it meets the regulatory requirements and eliminates the safety concerns associated with gene transfection. The unique and potentially transformative aspects of this proposal are 1) the novel concept that the hMSC in vitro expansion leads to a breakdown in cellular homeostasis, 2)that NAD+/NADH metabolism and NAD+-dependent sirtuins are cellular energy sensors that preserve cellular homeostasis and properties, and that 3) NAD+-boosting is an implementable and effective strategy to preserve hMSC property in large scale manufacturing.  The project will establish a novel metabolic strategy to address a progress-limiting barrier in hMSC-basedcell therapy and therefore has broad impacts in Advanced Biomanufacturing of Therapeutic Cells(ABTC)."

The valve is unique within the circulatory system in its ability to undergo EndoMT, a process that is crucial to the growing embryo, and also to how the valve adapts to the mechanical environment to maintain itself and to respond to injury. The award will support fundamental research into the mechanobiology of EndoMT to determine how friction of the blood, flexing of the valve and other mechanical effects change the biological response of the living tissue. Broader impacts include the development of new treatments for valve disease and improving tissue engineering strategies to build new heart valves. The educational component is centered on exposing underrepresented high-school seniors to multidisciplinary engineering research at a week-long summer camp. The camp will integrate theory and practice of mechanobiology and artificial tissue fabrication, and is planned to increase student awareness and interest in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The research objective of this award is to advance the understanding of the role of cellular structure, architecture and mechanical milieu in the regulation of EndoMT. The following objectives are to be undertaken to understand this phenomenon: (I) Engineer a microfabricated system that applies defined strain, fluid flow and substrate stiffnesses to valve endothelial cells. (II) Examine the EndoMT process in these cells under mechanical and architectural regimes that mimic early development, homeostasis, growth, injury and disease using live imaging. (III) Examine the mechanoregulatory genes that control the EndoMT process via pharmacological inhibition or gene deletion.

Their relative abundance and capability to become many different cell types make them attractive as an alternative autologous cell source. However, the cellular heterogeneity present in MSC harvests complicates their therapeutic application since not all cells will behave in the same manner. Individual stem cells respond to biochemical and mechanical stimuli in their local microenvironment, which can direct differentiation along specific pathways/lineages. While substrate compliance has been extensively investigated in recent years as it relates to stem cell differentiation, little attention has been given to how the mechanical properties of individual cells can influence this process for themselves and their neighbors. Findings from the PI?s laboratory indicate cellular mechanical properties correlate with biological characteristics, such as gene expressions, and play an important role in determining the differentiation fate of stem cells. Not all MSCs behave uniformly, and this heterogeneity can dramatically impact the overall response of a sample. Understanding how the biological and mechanical characteristics of local cell populations relate to the larger group can provide clues to optimizing future regenerative therapies. <br/><br/>The proposed project will investigate the heterogeneity of MSC samples at the single-cell, neighboring (~101 cells), and population (~103+ cells) levels using two complimentary strategies. First, live-cell, gene expression-based markers will be used to identify differentiating and non-differentiating MSCs that have been chemically induced for osteogenesis and adipogenesis. Second, single-cell, elastic and viscoelastic testing will assess the mechanical heterogeneity in undifferentiated, ?partially? differentiated, and fully differentiated stem cell cultures. In addition to expanding knowledge of stem cell mechanics, this research program has the potential to vastly improve experimental approaches that strive to direct stem cell differentiation and improve regenerative responses following implantation. <br/> <br/>Intellectual Merit: The proposed project seeks to investigate the inherent heterogeneity present in mesenchymal stem cell populations. MSCs are typically investigated at the population level, which can obscure variations that exist among individual cells. Little is known about how single-cell, mechanical properties change during differentiation, but this knowledge is critical for fully understanding cell-substrate and cell-cell behavior. Likewise, elucidating the spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression in MSC samples can help determine optimal times and locations for biochemical stimulation. To pursue these goals, this project will use custom-designed molecular beacons to visualize mRNA molecules in live, differentiating MSCs. Atomic force microscopy will be used to mechanically characterize the elastic and viscoelastic properties of individual cells. Focus will be given to how local cell populations behave, biochemically and mechanically, in relation to the overall sample. Findings will be applicable to many fields, including stem cell biology, cell mechanics, and tissue engineering. The PI is a pioneer in the area of single-cell, mechanical biomarkers, an exciting new field that provides phenotypic characterization akin to gene and protein expression. The proposed research furthers the maturation of these transformative approaches by investigating the role of mechanical biomarkers in stem cell differentiation.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: As a biomedical engineer conducting research at the cross-section of math, biology, chemistry, and engineering, the PI is well-suited to provide an environment that highlights the need for interdisciplinary understanding. The outreach effort proposed here will provide primary and secondary school educators at the Providence Public School District the opportunity to conduct team-based research during the summer. Teachers specializing in different subjects will work together on projects that incorporate multiple areas of expertise. The goal of this project is to facilitate interaction among teachers so that they can develop interdisciplinary examples and experiments for their own classes. Students take many math and science courses throughout their education, encompassing algebra, geometry, biology, chemistry, and physics. However, these courses are almost always taught as isolated subjects, whereas real-world applications are increasingly interdisciplinary. The proposed project will be conducted as an extension of Brown University?s established GK-12 program. In addition to this outreach effort, the PI will refine his recently designed course on stem cell engineering for graduate and undergraduate students that covers areas of stem cell biology, regenerative medicine, and hands-on laboratory exercises. Experimental findings from the research portion of this proposal will be directly applicable to this course, which is the first of its kind at Brown University."

Pattern formation relies on communication between cell types as they progressively mold each other into the organs and structures that make up the body. This problem is very difficult to pursue in vertebrate animals due to their complexity. Since developmental mechanisms are highly conserved across animals, the proposed study instead addresses the problem of how one cell type directs the patterning of another cell type using sea urchin embryos, which offer an elegant patterning process in a comparatively simple system: the larval skeleton. Prior work identified multiple conserved genes that are required for skeletal patterning in sea urchin embryos; this project will use biochemical and molecular approaches to understand how these genes work together to generate the three-dimensional skeletal pattern. The results will define a mechanism for patterning as a result of communication between cell types and tissues; because the genes involved are highly conserved, this information will likely become a paradigm for patterning in more complex animals. The study will directly involve the participation of multiple undergraduate students, integrating their classroom knowledge with hands-on laboratory experiences, as well as scientific outreach to high school students in the Boston area to promote their interest in scientific careers. Finally, this project includes training of Boston area high school teachers in the summers, including classroom and laboratory experiences, with the intent of fostering the teaching of developmental biology in the high school science classroom."

Distinct from ion concentrations, the effect of ion release rates on cellular activity, and the critical control exerted by silicate structure and dissolution mechanisms on ion release rates and overall concentrations, and on resulting surface texture has not been examined previously. The PIs hypothesize that, for surfaces of similar initial texture, silicate structure exerts a major control on the dissolution mechanism, affecting the concentration and rate of ions released, the texture of the precipitated amorphous silica and HCA layers, the activation of specific genes and, ultimately, hMSC proliferation and differentiation into osteoblasts. This hypothesis will be tested by performing batch and flow-through experiments and determining hMSC proliferation and differentiation on pseudowollastonite (beta-CaSiO3, psW) and wollastonite (alpha- CaSiO3, Wol). The psW polymorph possesses strained high-energy silicate ?three-rings? that dissolve rapidly in water versus the stronger silicate chains in Wol that dissolve slower, while Bioglass 45S5 provides a positive control. Silicate structure and initial surface texture (roughness and particle size) effects will be examined independently. The dissolution and precipitation mechanisms and rates will be established by periodic solution analysis (pH, Si, Ca, P) using Inductively-Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy and by surface characterization using Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy. Reacted pellets will be used as substrates for hMSC cultures in standard culture media supplemented with osteogenic differentiation factors. Proliferation and differentiation into osteoblasts will be quantified periodically by fluorescence and total DNA content, osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase analyses (enzymes produced by osteoblasts), and identification of bone-specific genes (Cbfa-1, osteocalcin, osteopontin) using real time polymerase chain reaction. Periodic culture medium sampling will provide information on ion release rates in the presence of cells. The conceptual approach and experimental design provides a comprehensive group of ex vivo experiments that are closer to in vivo conditions than typical in vitro batch experiments in simulated body fluids, while examination of the effects of each parameter separately.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  The results of the proposed work could have a significant impact on the development of third-generation cell-and gene-affecting bioceramics with improved osteointegration properties, by providing an a priori basis for designing bioactive materials that control Si, Ca and P levels at optimized levels for hMSC proliferation, differentiation and osteoblast activity. The results could thus help to reduce dependence on expensive ad hoc materials synthesis and in vitro testing, decrease the post-operative recovery period following orthopaedic implant surgery and increase the life-span of the implant in the human body. The biomedical implications are especially critical for an increasingly aging population in the USA, where a significant rise (~80%) is projected in the demand for hip and knee implant surgeries over the next three decades. The proposed work also provides an integrated, interdisciplinary training program including surface-chemistry, crystal structure and cell biology to graduate and undergraduate students. Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at conferences; incorporated into graduate courses taught by the PI and co-PI; and used to develop a Museum Exhibit for K-12 students at University of Wisconsin.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>"

MSCs are bone marrow-derived adult stem cells that are involved in wound healing and tissue regeneration. In the body, their recruitment to tumor or wound tissues is mediated by soluble proteins often released from hypoxic (oxygen-deprived) tissues. In the lab, MSC treatment with soluble proteins or hypoxia increases MSC migration. The proposed studies will systematically characterize the effects of tumor-secreted soluble proteins and/or hypoxia on the microscopic mechanical properties of MSCs. The mechanical response of a cell to chemical or physical stimuli is regulated by the cytoskeleton, a dynamic network of protein filaments extending throughout the cytoplasm. The cytoskeletal filaments are linked to adhesion molecules in the extracellular environment by focal adhesion complexes. The organization of cytoskeletal filaments and focal adhesion complexes changes rapidly during cell migration. Using quantitative real-time microscopy techniques, including particle tracking microrheology and time-lapsed fluorescent microscopy, the effects of selected stimuli on intracellular rheology, cytoskeletal organization (including cytoskeletal filaments and focal adhesion proteins), and interaction with cell adhesion molecules will be monitored. Together these techniques will be used to identify the mechanical and adhesive properties of migratory MSCs.<br/><br/>MSCs are good candidates for the development of cell-based therapeutics. They can be easily harvested from bone marrow, expanded in the lab, genetically manipulated, and differentiated into different types of tissues. However, ex vivo expansion of MSCs alters their morphology limiting their mobility after reinfusion.  The studies will provide fundamental information that will be used to optimize the migratory behavior of expanded MSCs. If the research is successful, these studies may provide a new strategy for the delivery of MSC-based therapeutics."

These cartilage defects have little inherent ability to repair. Current clinical treatments are inadequate as they often lead to fibrocartilage formation and joint pain. The goal of this proposal is to develop chondrocytes specifically for superficial zone cartilage regeneration. The premise of this strategy is to provide clinicians with an early stage intervention approach, and one that would also prevent the formation of more debilitating defects. This group has recently demonstrated the ability to derive osteochondroprogentior cells (OPCs) from primary mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and shown these OPCs to be responsive to insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), an anabolic growth factor associated with functional articular cartilage. It has been shown that hyaluronic acid (HA) can lead to up-regulate chondrocytic expression of superficial zone protein (SZP), a key phenotypic marker for superficial zone chondrocytes. These results led to the development of the following hypotheses. It is hypothesized that the dynamic culture of human mesenchymal stem cells within chondrogenic media will provide an environment conducive for rapid chondrocytic differentiation. Specifically, enhanced oxygen and nutrient transport, provided by the dynamic culture conditions, will promote hMSC viability and proliferation, while TGF-beta3 delivery and shear forces imparted the by perfusing chondrogenic media will promote chondrocytic differentiation. To examine this hypothesis, dynamic culture parameters will be developed so as to direct MSC differentiation into OPCs. Second, it is hypothesized that controlled delivery of IGF-1 to osteochondroprogenitor cells will encourage their maturation to differentiated superficial zone chondrocytes, as demonstrated by up-regulated PRG4 and type II collagen expression. In addition, it is hypothesized that engineered superficial zone cartilage can effectively treat superficial articular cartilage defects in a rat model. To examine these hypotheses, delivery exogenous IGF-1 to osteochondroprogenitor cells within the TPS bioreactor environment will be performed and their maturation into superficial zone chondrocytes will be assessed as well, as indicated by PRG4 and type II collagen production, and then utilize this engineered construct to regenerate superficial zone cartilage in a rat model.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>The broader impacts of this project include the development of an engineered tissue and the elucidation of new strategies and technologies within regenerative medicine. In addition, enhancing biomedical engineering research at multiple education levels is a key aspect of the work's impact. The key activity related to this proposal will be the development and execution of a new series of projects associated with the Engineering World Health (EWH) chapter at the University of Maryland.

Branching<br/>morphogenesis is a widespread phenomenon in animal development,<br/>generating the form of such organs as the lung, mammary gland,<br/>salivary gland, and kidney.  Although nearly every technique of<br/>cellular and developmental biology has been applied to it, and<br/>much has been learned from these experiments, there is still<br/>uncertainty as to the mechanism of branching.  The overwhelming<br/>majority of experiments on branching have concentrated on<br/>biochemical aspects, following the dominant paradigm in<br/>biological research of the last few decades.  Yet the essence of<br/>morphogenesis is that tissues grow and move and change shape, and<br/>this requires physical forces to emerge from the molecular<br/>biology.  Hence the next logical step in morphogenesis research<br/>is study of the biomechanical aspects, which are what create and<br/>modify form.  A mathematical model will be developed of the<br/>mechanical forces and resulting material deformations of the<br/>tissues involved in morphogenesis.

There is increasing interest in developing tissue engineered cartilage replacements using adult stem cells seeded on a scaffold.

Some of the drawbacks of this method include the extensive cell culture time, the use of super-physiological concentrations of growth factors, and the difficulty in maintaining the articular cartilage phenotype and preventing cartilage hypertrophy.

The objectives of this work are to 1) evaluate soluble peptides for their ability to induce or promote mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into cartilage cells, 2) investigate synergistic effects and maintenance of the cartilage phenotype using experimental design techniques, and 3) develop a novel protein-based scaffold and demonstrate the activity of these peptides within the context of a three-dimensional scaffold. The results from this proposal will demonstrate proof of principle and serve as preliminary data for a future NSF proposal that establishes the peptides as a general design rule by systematically examining them in the context of different scaffolds. The future proposal will also explore the interactions of biochemical and biomechanical properties in controlling cell differentiation. In addition, the work proposed here will demonstrate the utility of a new resilin-based protein scaffold containing chemical and photocrosslinking sites. These results will serve as the preliminary data for a separate proposal that investigates the biocompatibility, mechanical properties, and in vivo use for cartilage engineering applications.<br/><br/>Broader Impact<br/>The proposed work will improve technologies for treating cartilage damaged from disease or injury. In addition, the methodology developed here can be extended for use in other applications such as bone or soft tissue grafts and for the design of multicellular tissues such the liver or vascularized organs. The PI is committed to the recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in engineering and will engage in individual and group mentoring of female students (high school, undergraduate, and graduate). As part of the Women in Engineering Program, she is actively involved with the graduate mentoring program and is developing a laboratory module to introduce high school students to a high-throughput technique used to evaluate tissue engineering scaffolds. Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be recruited through the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Indiana to participate in research during the summer and academic year.  The work will also train a female graduate student and mentor her through the process of obtaining a faculty position where she will serve as a role model and mentor to future students.  The research will be integrated into the development of undergraduate and graduate level courses on tissue engineering and protein engineering. These courses will emphasize critical<br/>analysis and introduce students to cutting edge technologies through the use of primary literature papers.<br/>"

This award is co-funded by BioMaPS funds in the Division of Materials Research, and the Biomedical Engineering program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. Zinc oxide, which has electromechanical properties and is a growth factor mimetic, will be fabricated into a mechanically flexible, polymer composite scaffold to promote stem cell differentiation and tissue growth for cartilage repair. Osteoarthritis is a debilitating, degenerative joint disease where cartilage and the underlying bone tissue becomes damaged and can worsen with time. No technology exists that can restore fully functional cartilage tissue. Zinc oxide scaffolds will be fabricated and fully characterized for their bifunctional properties. Mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into cartilage and bone cells will be evaluated on the scaffolds in vitro. The proposed work would have a significant impact on the fields of smart materials for possible tissue regeneration and repair. The research efforts here also will be disseminated in teaching, training, and education. The principal investigator's laboratory is actively involved in the training, mentoring and recruitment of underrepresented minority and female students starting at the junior high school level through various community and university programs, and these activities are enhanced and strengthened with this award.<br/> <br/>Technical: This project will investigate a bifunctional smart material for tissue engineering strategies. Zinc oxide (ZnO), which is piezoelectric and a growth factor mimetic, will be utilized, for the first time, for its functional properties in tissue engineering applications. ZnO will be used in composite form with polycaprolactone (PCL) as a scaffold to promote stem cell differentiation. Two specific aims will be addressed. Aim 1 of this award is to fabricate and fully characterize the piezoelectric properties of ZnO-polymer composite scaffolds.  Nanoparticles of ZnO will be combined with PCL, a slow-degrading biomaterial, to form composite fibrous scaffolds, and  controlled release/dissolution of zinc oxide will be determined. Composites will also be characterized for electrical output in conditions that more closely mimic a biological setting. The piezoelectric scaffolds will then be characterized for localized nanoscale electromechanical behavior as well as bulk properties in order to correlate biological response with electromechanical activity. The second aim of this award is to investigate the osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells on the ZnO-PCL composite scaffold in vitro. This study is based on the hypothesis that the use of a fibrous scaffold having similar physicochemical properties as the native extracellular matrix will stimulate the differentiation of msenchymal stem cells. Therefore, in addition to developing a novel combination therapy for the repair of cartilage defects, this study will enhance the scientific understanding of the role of piezoelectric or electromechanical effects on cell differentiation, and potential applications in cartilage repair and regeneration. With respect to teaching, training and outreach activities, the researchers will recruit and mentor underrepresented minorities and women in the research activities supported by this award."

The overall objective of this project is to understand how pore size and matrix elasticity in a 3D environment regulate stem cell-based cartilage regeneration. The building blocks for the novel 3D scaffold are ribbon-like and microsized hydrogels that can be cross linked to encapsulate human mesenchymal stem cells and provide an environment with independently tunable pore size, matrix elasticity and chemical properties. The proposed studies will provide valuable information about the environment needed to achieve complete stem cell based cartilage repair. Educational and outreach impact will be achieved through enhanced research experiences for involved students, new graduate level courses, and activities involving high school teachers and underrepresented K-12 students. This award is co-funded by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research through the BioMaPs program.<br/><br/>Articular cartilage injuries as a result of trauma and degenerative diseases present a serious health problem. Osteoarthritis alone affects more than 27 million people in the U.S. and is predicted to affect 1 in 2 people in their lifetime. Chondrocytes in the cartilage have a poor regenerative capacity, and most articular injuries cannot heal without open surgery or other invasive intervention. Autologous cartilage implantation, or ACI, and the microfracture technology are the established treatments for cartilage repair, but these methods are often limited by insufficient cartilage supply, continual cartilage degeneration, and the formation of fibrosis cartilages that do not provide sufficient mechanical strength to sustain body loads. Stem cell-based cartilage regeneration provides tremendous hopes for people suffering from cartilage injuries. The success of stem cell chondrogenesis relies on an ideal cell niche that provide properly orchestrated niche properties, forming the key elements that are crucial for chondrogenesis, including biochemical and biophysical cues, to promote the desired stem cell bioactivities. Macropores, the pore space no smaller than the typical cells, is a highly potential mechanosensing regulator to control the stem cell chondrogenic differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which niche properties in three-dimensions regulate stem cells chondrogenesis remain largely unclear. A platform to support the fundamental study on the complex interaction between niche properties and stem cell bioactivities is currently lacking.   Given the complex nature of how stem cells respond to niche properties in our body, a three-dimensional niche model that can easily control macroporosity, matrix elasticity and cell morphology will facilitate a mechanistic study on the niche effect on chondrogenesis, and may one day lead to an ideal cell niche to realize the ultimate goal of complete cartilage repair. This project will conduct the first step to attempt such goal by using the crosslinkable microribbons, which are ribbon-like and micron-sized hydrogels that emerged in the past couple years, as the building blocks to construct the model cell niches to provide a vast variation of pore size, cell shape, and elasticity. The microribbons provide the following functions to facilitate a comprehensive study on how niche compositions impact stem cells chondrogenesis: 1) direct cell encapsulation in three dimensions, 2) control of cell shape by tunable macropore size, 3) independently tunable biochemical and mechanical cues, and 4) interconnected macroporosity to retain the ECM components produced by cells. Using macroribbons, the investigators address 3 aims: 1) To develop a 3D model that exposes human mesenchymal stems cells (MSC) to various macropore sizes and matrix elasticity, and to evaluate the cellular properties of MSC with regard to cell shape, focal adhesion, cytoskeleton organization, and transcription factor activity; 2) To determine how macropore size, matrix elasticity and the associated cellular properties influence the chondrogenic differentiation of human MSC; and 3): To understand how macroporosity and matrix elasticity influence the production of cartilage matrix and the stability of chondrocyte phenotypes.  If successful, numerous patients suffering from cartilage injuries can benefit from the 3D macroporous cell niche developed. The proposed project spans multiple disciplines including engineering, biology and medicine. Students carrying out proposed research will benefit greatly by being exposed to a variety of experiments including organic synthesis, nanoindentation, stem cell cultivation and cellular assays. New graduate-level courses incorporating the elements from the proposed research will be developed to translate the research outcomes from lab benches to the classroom. Technology used for the proposed project, such as wet-spinning and scaffold fabrication, will be contributed to the outreaching programs hosted by the PI and the college of engineering, providing short lectures, summer camps, and hands-on lab experience to high school teachers and underrepresented K-12 students. The PI and co-PI will actively recruit female and minority students to conduct the proposed research."

By doing so, patients would avoid organ donor lists and immunosuppressive drugs, two of the biggest current obstacles for those in need of new organs. Although tissue engineering has shown success in small volume tissues, larger volumes have posed a greater challenge due to the inability to sustain cells in 3 dimensions (3D) both during growth and after implantation. Recent work has shown that the use of a bioreactor, a system that uses fluid flow to sustain cells in 3D, allows growth of large volume tissues. This research introduces a second population of cells to form a blood vessel network, to address sustaining the engineered tissue once implanted. This engineered tissue will then be implanted and assessed within a large animal bone graft model. The research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ming-Huei Cheng at Chang Gung Medical Center in Taiwan, who has previously established and translated a large animal bone graft model to human application. Integration and function of a live, engineered tissue implanted into an animal could present a realistic solution for large volume regenerative medicine.<br/><br/>To test this concept, adult stem cells previously used to form bone tissue (mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)) and endothelial cells obtained from adult peripheral blood (endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs)) will be used to form live tissue within the bioreactor. ECFCs and MSCs isolated from autologous pigs will be co-cultured using an aggregate angiogenesis assay in fibrin hydrogels to form interconnected vascular networks. Current research suggests that the presence of ECFCs improves the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, forming mineralized scaffolds. Multiple scaffolds will be cultured to form large volume tissues in a perfusion bioreactor. This nascent tissue will be implanted against the periosteum to promote tissue integration and remodeling. To assess integration and function of the scaffold, bone mineralization and vascularization will be quantified over time using histology.

Studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells, while few in number, are highly sensitive to mechanical stimulation, but the types and magnitudes of stimuli they experience in the body are largely unknown. An experimental study will be conducted to measure the pressure at different locations within the hip during simulated walking.

The PI has developed novel technology that will allow visualization of cell behavior in the living embryo. As a result of live-cell imaging, it is now possible to analyze the cellular behavior that occurs during the EMT and more importantly to perturb the process molecularly using electroporation of expression plasmids.

This process is a necessary step in the development of the vertebrate body plan, providing an unprecedented opportunity to study not only organ development, but also re-programming of cell types to allow them to take on novel roles in a highly coordinated fashion.

Growth factors have long been recognized as potent drivers of MSC growth and differentiation. However, recent studies have demonstrated that scaffold stiffness can have a similar degree of influence on MSC differentiation. These findings have opened up the possibility that MSC differentiation can be dictated by tailoring scaffold material properties alone. A complex array of scaffold properties is currently recognized to impact MSC lineage progression.

Obesity significantly increases risk factors for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular diseases. A pathological recruitment of new fat cells, or adipocytes, contributes to obesity, and a source of adipocytes can be mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs). However, there is a significant knowledge gap in understanding the environmental factors that control MSC differentiation into adipocytes, and research is needed on how to prohibit the differentiation of MSCs into fat cells. This seriously limits therapeutic ways to treat obesity. The goal of this study is to gain a thorough insight on how mechanical signals regulate the propensity of MSCs to differentiate into adipocytes, and on the basis of this knowledge propose novel therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat obesity. Therefore, the proposed studies are expected to address in the long run the unmet needs in obesity and relieve the high medical spending over obesity and related diseases. Research will be integrated with educational efforts to offer engineering students a basic foundation on stem cell bioengineering. This educational goal will be achieved by curriculum development on stem cell-based bioengineering, graduate student training, training undergraduates via Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experiences (UCARE) program at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and the Lab Experience Program for Homeschool Students (LEPHS) developed by the PI.<br/><br/>A pathological recruitment of new adipocytes to form adipose tissue hyperplasia induces obesity, and one of the main causes of adipocyte number growth is the recruitment of newly formed preadipocytes from MSC sources. Since MSCs have plasticity to commit and differentiate into various lineages, it is critical to understand how MSCs determine their fate to adipocytes to deal with obesity. However, there is a huge knowledge barrier in regard to complex adipogenesisleading milieus, biochemical, mechanical and physical, and how to prohibit the adipogenesis of MSCs. This seriously limits therapeutic ways to treat obesity. The long-term goal of this study isto gain a thorough insight on how mechanical signals regulate MSC adipogenesis for potential therapeutic attempts targeting molecular mechanosensors. For this goal, this CAREER study exploits a novel adipocytic mechanotransduction theme. It is proposed to inhibit MSC adipogenesis via applying mechanical cell stretch and unveil primary molecular mechanisms that govern MSC stretch mechanotransduction during the course of adipogenesis. Two Specific Aims are proposed. 1. To examine the effects of mechanical stretch at varying regimens in inhibiting MSC adipocytic commitment and differentiation. 2. To determine the role of cellsubstrate and cell-cell interactions in the stretch inhibition of MSC adipogenesis. The hypothesis to be tested is that mechanical stretch will induce inhibitory effects on MSC adipogenesis via cell-substrate and/or cell-cell interaction-mediated mechanotransduction mechanisms. The proposed studies may suggest a novel adipocytic mechanotransduction strategy to treat obesity. Specifically, sensitizing molecular mechanosensors, for example, focal adhesion kinase(FAK) and cadherin cell-cell adherens junction, may enhance mechanical inhibitory effects acting on MSC adipogenesis. This may suggest potential molecular therapeutic targets for dealing with obesity. Research efforts will be integrated with educational and outreach efforts at the high school, undergraduate and graduate student levels."

Thus, siRNA may provide potent cues to direct stem-cell differentiation for regenerative medicine applications.  However, development of technology to provide patterned, localized, and efficacious delivery of siRNA is crucial for realizing this potential.  The objective of this work is to incorporate and control the patterning of polymer nanoparticles (NPs) to deliver siRNA within a hydrogel to affect encapsulated mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation, where MSCs are multipotent precursor cells capable of differentiating into cells of the musculoskeletal lineage.  The PI aims to develop hydrogel scaffolds that can be patterned with powerful siRNA differentiation cues capable of directing osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs for osteochondral tissue engineering applications.  Four technical objectives have been established to achieve this goal: (1) Assemble and characterize siRNA/polymer nanoparticles (NPs) to direct MSC osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation.  (2) Exploit controlled release chemistries to sustain the release of siRNA from or within hydrogels.  (3) Develop spatial photopatterning techniques for siRNA/polymer NP within hydrogel microenvironments.  (4) Exploit spatiotemporally regulated siRNA/polymer NP availability to develop osteogenic, chondrogenic, and osteochondral tissue in vitro.  The results of these objectives will establish MSC differentiation induced by siRNA within hydrogel microenvironments.  Moreover, it will demonstrate that delivery of spatiotemporally controlled differentiation cues can be exploited to develop complex tissue structures.  These developments will advance and expand the utility of siRNA for numerous therapeutic applications within regenerative medicine and beyond, where spatial and temporal depot delivery is required.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  Over 50% of orthopaedic injuries involve damage to osteochondral tissues within articular joints.  Due to the paucity of regenerative strategies, these injuries commonly progress to irreversible degenerative osteoarthritis.  This work will develop the means to exploit spatially and temporally controlled siRNA therapeutics for osteochondral tissue regeneration.  However, the approach can readily be tailored for the engineering of any multicomponent tissue.  Beyond the anticipated scientific results, the PI has planned a variety of activities to educate non-engineers as well as to recruit and retain women and underrepresented minorities in engineering.  Specifically, the PI will be proactive in working with UR programs aimed at increasing diversity and exposing high school students to possible career opportunities in engineering.  These programs include:  hosting and mentoring Xerox, Kearns, and SURF students each summer, developing and teaching hands-on laboratory experiments for UR's Summer Scholars Program, working with UR's Women In Engineering Group to host events in our laboratory and speak to visiting student groups, hosting shadowing high school students, and speaking at numerous public engagements to educate the general public about engineering's impact in society (e.g., WXXI Healthy Friday radio program, Annual Benoit Laboratory Alex's Lemonade Stand)."

Of the major environmental cues, the presentation of membrane associated ligands involved in cell-cell interactions (e.g. cadherin, notch) and the sequestering of soluble factors (e.g. transforming growth factor-beta) at the cell surface have not yet been well established in 3D culture systems.  As the 3D context is more appropriate for biomimicry of the stem cell niche, our long-term goal is to integrate microsphere-supported biomembrane systems into 3D matrices.  This will be accomplished using a composite 3D hydrogel scaffold architecture that integrates laterally mobile ligands/bound factors positioned in microsphere-supported biomembrane systems known as proteolipobeads.  For the first time, this will allow for the laterally mobile presentation of various ligands/membrane-bound factors to stem cells within a 3D format via novel, molecularly engineered interfaces with controlled surface densities.  Thus, the specific focus of this proposal is to build a platform that incorporates laterally mobile N-Cadherin fragments and the TGF-beta3 receptor, TGF-beta-R3 (i.e., beta-glycan), in proteolipobeads suspended in a 3D matrix for presentation to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).  The proposed mode of N-cadherin and TGF-beta-R3 display will be used to investigate the effects of N-cadherin-mediated cell-cell communication events and TGF-beta3 sequestering on MSC chondrogenesis in vitro and serve as the proof-of-concept for this transformative technology.  The specific hypothesis behind the proposed research is that the introduction of proteolipobead assemblies into 3D scaffolds is a viable biomimetic means to present ligands/bound factors to stem cells and mimic cellular communication in the stem cell niche.  The objectives are designed to examine if this mode of ligand presentation can be achieved and to assess the effects on stem cell viability and differentiation.  Objective 1 is to embed N-cadherin/TGF-beta-R3 proteolipobeads in carboxymethylcellulose 3D constructs and probe N-Cadherin display and TGF-beta3 growth factor sequestration.  Objective 2 is to investigate the interaction between N-cadherin/TGF-beta-R3 biomembrane-microspheres and hMSCs by monitoring MSC viability and chondrogenic differentiation.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  The benefits to society of the proposed activity are that contributions from the research could help cross major technological barriers in stem cell bioengineering, so that humanity can ultimately guide stem cell regeneration processes.  Essentially a whole dimension in stem cell ligand/bound factor presentation has not yet been achieved, and the proposed scaffold design may lead to new molecular methods for control of stem cells in 3D culture.  In addition, this work may lead to innovative therapies for cartilage repair, which is a significant clinical problem.  To go beyond the impact of the research outcomes, we will implement a new mechanism for advancing discovery while promoting training and learning.  This program will be specifically tailored to inner-city middle and high school students and aimed at stimulating a fascination with the molecular basis for color.  This educational outreach integrates UV-VIS pigment identification field studies of sanctioned and renegade street graffiti art in the CCNY (Harlem) neighborhood.  A concurrently running online dye and pigment database will be created, that will be further augmented with molecular structure and absorption-relevant molecular orbital visualizations using computational chemistry packages.  The very same pigments, dyes, and fluorophores have dual uses in paints and as molecular reporter groups in the proposed studies.  Thus, the participating labs are well positioned to provide the initial research setting along this learning pathway for local students who take an interest in the molecular basis of color.  The results of this research in stem cell biomaterial engineering will be broadly disseminated via oral presentations at conferences, and in regular student research poster symposia at CCNY."

If the cartilage tissue in the growth plate is injured, bony tissue is deposited at the injured site, thus disrupting the growth plate and leading to abnormal bone growth. A new biomaterial delivery system that provides local, sustained delivery of silencing RNA and TGF-1 growth factor will be engineered, and the influence of the co-delivery of these bioactive factors on the chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells examined. Short interfering RNA (siRNA) provides a powerful gene silencing mechanism, inhibiting gene expression at the translational level by targeted destruction of specific mRNA sequences. Due to this ability to silence the expression of specific proteins, and since siRNA functions directly in the cytoplasm of the cell rather than being incorporated into the genomic DNA and its effect is transient, the impact of siRNA in clinical applications could be enormous. Unfortunately, the delivery of siRNA is currently a major hurdle to its clinical use, as siRNA is readily degraded and cleared from the body. The work in this proposal will provide new methods for delivering siRNA to a local site in a sustained, controlled manner. Co-delivery of growth factor to improve cartilage repair of growth plate injuries will also be examined. Thus, the engineering solution proposed here is the development of a delivery system capable of releasing two different bioactive factors, one to inhibit the formation of the bony tissue at the injury site and another to encourage the chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells that are present in the area so they form cartilage tissue. <br/><br/>Broader Significance and Importance: <br/><br/>Ultimately this technology could offer a much-needed therapeutic option for growth plate injuries in children. As children grow, their bones lengthen by mineralization of cartilage at the bone-cartilage interface in the growth plate. Injury to the growth plate can lead to the deposition of bony tissue within the cartilage, thus disrupting the growth plate. This disruption can result in serious consequences, including the bone not growing to its full length or the growth occurring abnormally such that the bone curves as it grows. In addition to addressing a clear clinical need, the results of the proposed work will provide new methods for localized and sustained delivery of silencing RNA, which could potentially benefit other applications in the future as well.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: <br/><br/>This award will support both the increase and continuation of outreach efforts by Professor Krebs's lab. It will directly support the training of one graduate student for 2 years and the involvement of at least one undergraduate student and one high school intern in the project. The PI and graduate student will be participating in a summer camp for K-6 dyslexic students, designing science modules that will be presented to the students over the course of 2 of the 5 weeks of the summer camp. This will have a substantial impact on the students at the camp in awakening their scientific interest, and also on the PI and graduate student in learning more about dyslexia and ways that individuals can overcome it and/or use it to their benefit. The PI will also continue her support of hosting 1-2 female high school interns in the lab during the academic year through internship programs of local high schools. These students will work side-by-side with a graduate student and the PI on a specific project, and see it develop over the course of the year. Finally, the project would have broad societal impacts by providing a new biomaterial delivery system that could improve the treatment of growth plate injuries and also be used for other tissue regeneration applications in the future.<br/><br/>This research has been funded through the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering solicitation, which is part of the Broadening Participation in Engineering Program of the Engineering Education and Centers Division."

Therefore, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must be on the forefront of stem cell biology. Although a variety of stem cell populations exist, autogenic and allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells are among the most widely investigated population owing to their ability to be readily differentiated into any of the mesodermal tissues, including bone, cartilage, fat, tendon, and ligament.  Currently an enriched population of MSCs is obtained by differential centrifugation and/or plastic adherence. While both of these methods yield an enriched MSC population, neither offers a means to isolate and subsequently culture MSCs in one step. Most critically, these methods are only useful for in vitro culture of MSCs. The PI proposes the development of a modified biomaterial that can capture, culture, and differentiate an enriched MSC population, resulting in phenotypically stable chondrocytes. The proposed work will allow the FDA to remain on the forefront of stem cell technologies, both in the techniques utilized in the development of biomaterials for regenerative medicine and the interaction of stem cells with novel biomaterials. Finally, this work will promote FDA?s regulatory role by developing the in-house expertise to evaluate stem cell based technologies.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a multipotent stem cell line, have tremendous therapeutic potential, as they are capable of differentiating into various lineages such as bone, adipose, and cartilage. However, MSCs represent only a fraction of the cells that are found in the bone marrow and adipose tissue and lack unique identifying markers, which increases the difficulty of isolation. The goal of this proposed work is to develop a tissue engineering strategy to characterize MSC isolation based on adhesion, and to mimic the specific adhesive interactions on the surface of a biodegradable biomaterial to capture, culture, and differentiate MSCs for engineered cartilage tissue applications. To this end, the PI proposes to develop a device that will allow for in vivo recruitment and enrichment of MSCs, as well as provide a simple method for in vitro capture of MSCs."

This promise is currently limited by the ability to obtain relevant numbers of MSCs in an undifferentiated state, and therefore a significant expansion and biomanufacturing of MSCs  is needed prior to patient administration. Multiple issues stemming from the limited understanding of the effects of biomanufacturing on MSC behavior have significantly contributed to the lack of successful translation of MSCs to the clinic.  This team of researchers will overcome this limitation by performing basic research to understand the impact of microenvironment during biomanufacturing on MSCs and develop a novel 3D-printed biomaterial culture system that would enable the reproducible biomanufacturing of MSCs in a controlled microenvironment.  The research project will be integrated with education and workforce development efforts at all levels from K-12, community college, and graduate levels.<br/><br/>Several biomanufacturing issues that have limited the success of MSC clinical translation, including: 1) heterogeneity between MSCs derived from different donors, tissues, and manufactured using different conditions; 2) the lack of standardized approaches to manufacture MSCs and lack of critical quality attributes (CQAs) that effectively predict how a given MSC lot performs; and 3) the unknown impact of changes in 3D microenvironmental cues during biomanufacturing on MSC immunomodulatory function.  To address these issues, this project brings together an interdisciplinary research team to 1) identify distinct MSC morphological responses to microenvironment cues that predict MSC function following expansion in a large-scale 3D manufacturing context, and 2) develop a 3D-printed biomaterial culture system using microporous annealed particle (MAP) technology that enables expansion of MSCs with reproducible immunomodulatory function.

The proposed approach seeks to overcome intrinsically-poor auto-regenerative repair of disrupted elastic matrix by stable adult cell types. The investigators have recently shown bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC)-derived smooth muscle cells (BM-SMCs), but not undifferentiated BM-MSCs, to be significantly more elastogenic than adult vascular SMCs (healthy, diseased), and their secretions to stimulate elastic matrix regenerative repair by SMCs of a diseased, matrix assembly-impaired phenotype. As physical delivery of stem cells faces several challenges, this project proposes to design and test a stem cell-inspired, but cell-free regenerative approach to in situ ECM regenerative repair. The approach is based on sustained, local delivery of BM-SMC secretome components identified to be necessary and sufficient for pro-elastin regenerative stimulus from novel polymer nanocarriers that themselves exhibit pro-elastogenic and anti-proteolytic properties. Through experiments designed to address three specific aims, the investigators will test hypotheses that a) human BM-MSCs (hBM-MSCs) can be efficiently differentiated into SMCs (hBM-SMCs) exhibiting distinct, elastogenicity-determining phenotypic states; b) pro-elastogenic effects of hBM-SMCs on abdominal aortic aneurysm SMCs are mediated by their secreted trophic factors (secretome); c) key components of hBM-SMC secretome individually or in combination are necessary and sufficient for pro-elastogenic and anti-proteolytic effect; and d) integrating sustained delivery of key hBM-SMC secretome factor(s) with nanocarriers will augment quantity & quality of regenerative elastic matrix repair in an ECM-disrupted, 3-D tissue space.

While the primary focus is on MSCs, many of the questions being addressed are relevant to other mammalian cells. Theoretical models will be developed of cell spreading, adhesion and cell shape on smooth surfaces and on nano-patterned surfaces. Computational signaling models will be built that uncovers the linkages between cell shape and the differentiation decision of MSCs. Experiments in collaborating laboratories will facilitate model development and model validation.The project will help understand how the physical properties of the tissues themselves affect tissue maintenance (or homeostasis) through modulation of the differentiation decision of multipotent stem cells. This may be the process by means of which the extra-cellular matrix helps shape tissues. An understanding of these processes is currently lacking, and this research seeks to help fill this gap. The project will yield new insights into tissue homeostasis and development via the development of biophysical models of cells in different environments, which integrates the interactions and the feedback between the environment, the cellular cytoskeleton and signaling. <br/><br/>The research program offers support for training graduate students, undergraduate students, school students and K-12 teachers. The main educational goal of the PI is teaching and disseminating modeling methods for biology and ecology to students at different levels, from school students to graduate students. The PI will develop an undergraduate-level course on modeling methods in biology, and incorporate research carried out in his laboratory, as well as current research from the world over, in the syllabus. Apart from training graduate students in his laboratory, the PI will offer undergraduate students and incoming freshmen, especially students from underrepresented minorities, an opportunity to participate in summer research. In collaboration with the Education and Outreach Center of the College of Natural Sciences (EOC-CNS) at CSU, the PI will develop course material and hold workshops to train K-12 teachers in the art and science of building computational models to understand complex biological and ecological phenomena using free online tools such as Netlogo. This will also be applied to ongoing K-12 projects that the EOC-CNS is currently involved. The EOC-CNS will help design the workshops, recruit teachers especially those who teach under-represented minorities, and will also help evaluate the impact of the workshops by a professional evaluator.  K-12 teachers attending the workshop will be trained to incorporate computational models into their teaching, as well as into school research activity. Workshops will also be offered directly to school students, in collaboration with K12 teachers, during summer STEM camps organized by schools in Fort Collins. The emphasis will be on exploiting modeling tools such as Netlogo to make and visualize simple models that give insight into complicated phenomena, involving nonlinearity, stochasticity, feedback and synchronization. Examples will be taken from ecology and biology, and especially on modeling phenomena that K-12 students will encounter in their classes."

The premise of the work is that further fundamental knowledge and subsequent control of the cell-environment interactions, gained through the development of novel biomaterials, will help advance the field.  With this in mind, the governing hypothesis of the proposed work is that hydrogels with spatially controlled properties can be used to direct and define cellular spreading, migration, and phenotypes in 3-dimensions, towards the engineering of complex tissues.  The objectives of the research plan are: (1) to synthesize novel multifunctional macromers that form networks with spatially controlled properties using sequential crosslinking procedures, (2) to utilize the synthesized hydrogels to control the spreading and migration of mesenchymal stem cells and develop structure/outcome relationships, and (3) to assess control over cellular differentiation in hydrogels through spatially controlled crosslinking density.  The proposed research is multidisciplinary and covers many fields from polymer science to cellular biology. Limitations in available materials may have stalled significant advances in the fields of mesenchymal stem cell biology and tissue regeneration, and thus this work presents an intellectual advance in these areas.  <br/>The proposed educational activities are integrated within this research and include education to graduate students and undergraduate students in the laboratory and classroom, outreach to a local high school, and international outreach to a university in Africa.  The specific components include: (1) continued involvement of students, emphasizing women and minority students, in the principal investigator's laboratory and integration of a laboratory component for ""hands-on"" learning into a course on Biomaterials that is taught to upper-level undergraduate and graduate students; (2) outreach to students in Philadelphia schools through the development of a course on 'Materials in the World' that gives high school students exposure to material science and biomaterials to encourage careers in these fields; and (3) travel to Ghana, Africa to educate students in the area of biomedical engineering, a topic that is not encompassed into any current curriculum, and invitations to students from Africa to join the principal investigator's laboratory at Penn during the summer months."

The major problems to be addressed in this project are (i) movement by shape changes, (ii) modeling of the intracellular mechanics, and (iii) integration of signaling, actin dynamics and mechanics in an integrated computational model of cell movement.  Heretofore mathematical modeling has primarily focused on the mesenchymal mode, but the investigators first address the other end of the continuum.  The overall objective is to produce a unified description for locomotion in a three-dimensional extracellular matrix that integrates signaling and mechanics.  Movement by shape changes has not been studied in the context proposed, but it has recently been shown to be important in the movement of a number of cell types, and understanding the factors that affect the speed and efficiency of such movement is a challenging problem.  This project develops mathematical models that can be used to study and quantify the importance of various factors, such as properties of the surrounding medium, that affect the efficiency of movement.  The third component continues previous work by the principal investigator on signaling and will integrate a model of the control networks with the mechanical components that comprise the first topics.  This will lead to the first model that incorporates both signaling and mechanics, and will result in a computational tool that should be very useful to the broader community.<br/><br/>Cell movement is a very complex process that involves the spatial and temporal control and integration of a number of subprocesses, including the transduction of chemical or mechanical signals from the environment, intracellular biochemical responses, and translation of the intra- and extracellular signals into a mechanical response.  While many single-celled organisms use flagella or cilia to swim, there are two basic modes of movement used by eukaryotic cells that lack such structures--mesenchymal and amoeboid.  The former, which can be characterized as ?crawling? in fibroblasts or ?gliding? in keratocytes, involves the extension of finger-like pseudopodia and/or broad flat lamellipodia, whose protrusion is driven by actin polymerization at the leading edge. In the amoeboid mode, which does not rely on strong adhesion, cells are more rounded and employ shape changes to move--in effect 'jostling through the crowd' or 'swimming'.  However, recent experiments have shown that numerous cell types display enormous plasticity in locomotion, in that they sense the mechanical properties of their environment and adjust the balance between the modes. Thus pure crawling and pure swimming are the extremes on a continuum of locomotion strategies, but many cells can sense their environment and use the most efficient strategy in a given context.  This project uses innovative mathematical approaches to better understand the dynamics of cell locomotion, combining novel models with experimental data.  Additionally, the research team includes postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, with the project providing an opportunity to work in an inherently interdisciplinary field."

However, the grand challenge in current hiPSC disease modeling is that these models have tended to simplify the diseases as being a result of a single defective gene without taking into account the many other influences of genetic-environmental interactions. Specifically, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition in which the heart cells enlarge causing the heart wall to thicken, is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death among young adults and athletes, which indicates that physical stress increases the risk of developing heart failure in the patients already at risk due to genetic factors. Therefore, to develop useful ""HCM-in-a dish"" model systems, it is necessary to precisely control the environmental stress exerted on hiPS-derived cardiac tissues.  This project focuses on the MYBPC3 gene, which is one of the most frequently mutated HCM genes.  Though the relationship has been established, the mechanisms by which MYBPC3 mutations lead to HCM are not known. Thus, the primary goal of this project is to investigate the correlation between HCM characteristics and reduced MYBPC3 expression, and how this could be influenced by the increase of environmental stress to the cardiac tissues.  Key to the success of this effort is creating a functional/beating 3D cardiac tissue model of HCM, which offers better understanding of how the genetic defects combine with the cellular and tissue environment to initiate and advance the disease. More broadly, the strategies developed in this project could be applied to studying other cardiac diseases and potentially lead to new therapies for disease management and treatment. This new approach (which requires hiPSC technology, cardiac tissue engineering, advanced 3D bioprinting, and materials processing and characterization) will provide significant and presently unavailable opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students to have exciting research experiences and state-of-the-art training in biomedical engineering and nanotechnology. This will be accomplished with coordinated, structured instruction and assessments in the form of coursework, seminars, and workshops, as well as with participation in the research laboratory environment.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to establish an isogenic, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSs) based tissue model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), for studying how genetic defects interplay with the cellular and tissue environment to initiate and progress the disease.  HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death among young adults and athletes, which indicates that physical stress increases the risk of developing heart failure in patients with HCM-related genetic predispositions. This project focuses on the MYBPC3 gene, one of the most frequent mutated HCM genes, though molecular mechanisms by which MYBPC3 mutations lead to HCM remain elusive. The central hypothesis of this project is that the severity of HCM phenotype would be dose-dependent on the reduction of MYBPC3 gene expression and protein content (haploinsufficiency), which could be exacerbated by the increase of environmental stress to cardiac microtissues derived from hiPSCs (hiPS-microCTs).  The microtissue model will be established by integrating: 1) hiPSC technology for understanding human-specific HCM disease mechanisms associated with MYBPC3 mutations, 2) laser-based bioprinting method for the creation of three-dimensional (3D) hiPS-microCTs on the filamentous matrices with controllable biomechanical stress, and 3) gene-editing approach for the generation of MYBPC3 loss-of-function mutations with identical genetic background (isogenic) as wild type (WT) and dose-dependent reduction of MYBPC3 gene expression. The research plan is organized under three objectives: 1) To correlate the biomechanical stress presented to the MYBPC3 deficient isogenic hiPS-microCTs with the HCM disease severity based on the primary phenotypic metrics; 2) To correlate the haploinsufficiency level in the MYBPC3 deficient isogenic hiPS-microCTs with the HCM disease severity under different biomechanical stress; and 3) To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the stress-induced disease progression of MYBPC3-associated HCM. The combination of hiPSC technology, 3D bioprinting, gene editing method and tissue engineering approaches provides great potential in the development of next generation hiPSC-based disease-specific in vitro preclinical tissue models. This model will be a significant advancement for investigating genotype-phenotype correlation associated with the clinical heterogeneity, elucidating the disease progression in human cardiomyopathies, and developing new therapeutic strategies for disease management and treatment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While autologous bone grafts are the most effective method to heal complex defects, the available graft material is limited, and the procedure involves additional surgery known to cause chronic donor-site pain in many patients. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been intensely investigated for their ability to promote bone healing, but results have been variable and disappointing. This is at least partly due insufficient retention of hMSCs at the site of injury for sufficient time to achieve engraftment and promote repair. In an attempt to solve these problems, hMSCs have been treated with the small molecule PPAR inhibitor GW9662 to produce osteogenically-enhanced hMSCs (OEhMSCs). These OEhMSCs produce extracellular matrix (hMatrix) that dramatically increases hMSC retention and osteorepair in calvarial defects. The central hypothesis for this project is that an injectable microsphere vehicle co-administering GW9662, hMatrix and hMSCs will promote osteo-repair through a mechanism that involves extended hMSC retention, trophic factor secretion and paracrine activation of the host stroma. To test this, composite microspheres will be constructed and assessed for GW9662 delivery and hMatrix presentation to hMSCs in culture, as well as for their ability to promote repair of critical-sized defects in a mouse calvarial model. Finally, soluble factors secreted by hMSCs responsible for promoting osteoregeneration will be identified. These studies will lay the groundwork for translating this novel hMSC-based method for osteo-repair to the clinic. Successful completion of this project could lead to a revolutionary new method for bone repair that could effectively dismiss the need for autologus bone graft in regenerative orthopedics. These studies are based on the concept that providing an in vivo-like microenvironment stimulates hMSCs to behave as they do during normal tissue generation. This concept applies to hMSC-mediated healing in general, thus the knowledge gained from the proposed studies may eventally be applied to the regeneration of other tissue targets. The methods and concepts used to construct and evaluate the microsphere composites will be broadly disseminated in journals and conferences and incorporated into courses taught at Texas A&M.

The goal is to test hypotheses about how breeding drives bone growth and remodeling in females. Two bones that do and do not elongate in reproductive female mole rats (lumbar vertebrae and femur, respectively), and the same bones in nonreproductive females, will be compared for bone growth and bone-derived stem cell activity, mineralization potential, gene expression, and responsiveness to hormonal signals. The project will provide new information about how hormonal signals and hormonally-mediated gene expression changes result in bone growth that is related to fitness in this unusually cooperative mammal. Results will be broadly applicable to understanding the control of skeletal remodeling and growth in mammals. The project involves training of a postdoctoral fellow and volunteers at the Kalahari Research Centre in South Africa, and public education at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. <br/><br/><br/>This project will provide novel insight into the physiological and genomic targets of social evolution in the Damaraland mole rat. In females of this eusocial species, secondary skeletal growth (lumbar vertebrae elongation and widening of the pelvic girdle) is a function of reproductive activity and results in increased litter sizes. The project will investigate gene regulatory differences in bone-forming mesenchymal stem cells that explain this breeding female-specific growth phenotype. It will test the hypothesis that estrogen and insulin-like growth factor signaling differentiate reproductive females and non-breeders, and bones that experience secondary growth from those that do not. Differences in stem cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility at estrogen-receptor transcription-factor binding sites will be quantified. By elucidating the physiological mechanisms underlying permanent, secondary skeletal growth in mole rat females, the results will lead to a better understanding of how skeletal growth in adult mammals, including humans, is controlled."

Bioprinting technologies generally involve the encapsulation of living cells within biocompatible bioinks (such as hydrogels). However, with current technologies, capillary-sized networks cannot be printed within bioprinted constructs. These capillary-sized networks are critical for maintaining viability of tissue constructs and, therefore, are at the center of establishing the widespread application of current technologies. Ultrafast pulsed lasers are uniquely capable of machining capillary-sized networks within bioprinted constructs, however the impact of ultrafast laser machining on biological constructs is not known. This award supports fundamental research on effects of ultrafast laser micromachining on cellular damage. Research results will be useful for the development of a novel hybrid process combining laser micromachining and stereolithography bioprinting to produce bioprinted constructs that contains capillary-sized networks.<br/><br/>The research objective is to establish the relationship between ultrafast laser variables and cellular damage within cell-laden gelatin-based hydrogel biomaterials. To achieve this research objective, hydrogel constructs will be prepared by encapsulating mesenchymal progenitor cells within gelatin methacrylate hydrogel via ultraviolet crosslinking. Femtosecond laser multiphoton absorption process will be used to micromachine channels (about 10 microns in diameter) within the cell-laden hydrogel constructs. These constructs will have different cell densities (10,000 - 10,000,000 cells/mL), hydrogel concentration (7-18% w/v), and photoinitiator concentration (0.05-0.5% w/v). Experiments will be conducted under different ultrafast laser parameters: laser fluency from 0 to 25 J/cm^2, pulse energy from 0 to 100 nJ, and scanning speed from 0.1 to 10 mm/s. Cellular damage within hydrogel constructs will be evaluated by the following parameters: radial zones of cellular viability measured by confocal imaging of calcein AM-ethidium homodimer biomarkers, DNA damage measured using Comet assay, and function (ability to proliferate and produce extracellular matrix) measured using confocal imaging of EdU and Movat's fluorescent biomarkers."

However, the mechanisms regulating osteointegration of CaPs have yet to be understood.  Progress has stalled because of a lack of appropriate tools and methodologies that can isolate key regulators as well as combine them in a controlled and systematic way.  Three factors stand out as particularly important for the CaP system: microporosity, BMP-2, and biologic apatite.  The potential dominating mechanisms relating to osteointegration are hypothesized to be sequestration of BMP-2 and enhanced formation of biologic apatite in the presence of micropores.  The goal is to quantify the relative importance of and potential interactions between these factors at different stages of bone formation and to understand the mechanisms behind their influence, using CaPs as a biomaterial platform and a unique set of tools.  CaPs with macro (>100um) and microporosity (<50um) have greatly enhanced osteointegration as compared to those with only macroporosity.  While microporosity has been used primarily to enhance growth into macropores, there is now evidence that microporosity is also a space for bone and its inclusion in CaP scaffolds can result in multiscale ostointegration (MSO)-bone growth throughout both macro and micropores.  This has not been achieved with any other system.  The unique suite of tools will be used to examine the role of key regulators, microporosity, BMP-2, and bioapatite, and the mechanisms behind their influence on osteointegration.  The tools allow for (1) control of microporosity, which uniquely enables systematic exploration of microporosity and related characteristics, (2) attaching BMP-2 to CaPs with varying levels of affinity, which provides the unique opportunity to study the effects of both sequestered and releasing BMP-2, and (3) the capability to grow biological apatite on the surface of CaPs, which enables investigation of the influence of biological apatite on cell response.  Further, each of these parameters can be independently controlled.  The specific objectives are:  (1) Determine the minimum pore size through which cells will migrate given a potent chemotactic and osteoinductive stimulus, BMP-2.  This is critical for establishing bounds on pore characteristics for MSO.  (2) Determine the influence of the stimuli in attracting mesenchymal stem cells to the substrate.  (3) Determine the influence of the stimuli in matrix production and mineralization.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  Taken together, the systematic approach used here to combine the factors described and the proposed analysis will provide new insight into the rational design of biomaterials that interface with bone.  The potential advances will lead to new understanding of bone/material interactions, could have huge benefit for those affected by bone loss or joint failure (e.g. coated implants), and could relieve some of the economic burden associated with these procedures.  The main educational activities are related to developing an instructional module that uses an inquiry-based approach and engages science teachers at the Campus Middle School for Girls (CMSG, Urbana, IL) in research activities.  The objective in working with CMSG is to positively influence girls? perceptions of STEM, which may lead to their persistence in the field.  The work with CMSG is in partnership with an existing NSF NSEC, and the learning module will become part of the existing educational programs in the NSF Center for use in programs that target underrepresented groups."

The first step toward this objective is to apply methods for generating 3D bioactive signal and mechanical stiffness gradients to accelerate osteochondral tissue formation.  The overall strategy will be to measure the responses of stem cells to specific combinations of signal and stiffness gradients.  The stem cells to be evaluated are human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal stem cells (hUCMSCs), an exciting new cell source in musculoskeletal tissue engineering.  Gradients will be achieved by one of two means: a diffusion-driven hydrogel system and a novel microparticle-based scaffold. Combinations of signal and stiffness gradients will be explored, culminating in a construct in the shape of a mandibular condyle. Gradients have been used in a variety of other disciplines, and are crucial to guiding cell behavior in fundamental biological processes such as embryonic development and wound healing, but have yet to be investigated in musculoskeletal tissue engineering.  hUCMSCs remain virtually unexplored in musculoskeletal tissue engineering, and will have broad application.  Successful completion of this project will lead to a better fundamental understanding of hUCMSCs and gradient strategies, which will have a tremendous impact, offering the deliverable of a new cell source and a new paradigm of chemical and mechanical gradients for musculoskeletal tissue engineering.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  The educational objectives of the proposal are to (1) create a new project for high school girls at an existing summer engineering camp, (2) establish a formal link between the School of Engineering and an existing undergraduate research program (IMSD) for underrepresented groups, and (3) expand the burgeoning bioengineering graduate program at KU. The PI took an active leadership role in spearheading a multidisciplinary bioengineering graduate program that began in the Fall of 2007 at the University of Kansas.  Graduate students recruited for this project are likely to be from this degree program, identified as an educational and economic priority for Kansas.  The aforementioned undergraduate initiative will impact underrepresented groups across the School of Engineering. Elements of the research project will be incorporated into the tissue engineering course already developed by the PI, and will provide a new hands-on experiment in the PI?s annual ?Project Discovery? program, a week-long engineering summer camp for female high school students.<br/><br/><br/>"

The proposed study will fabricate a set of bonded microtubes fabricated from biodegradable nanofibers that are laminated with a cell-laden hydrogel composite to mimic the structure of osteons that are present in the natural bone matrix. These constructs are expected to provide structural support, facilitate transport nutrients and provide an environment for the homogenous production of extracellular matrix for the bone growth. Previous efforts to reconstruct large bone defects with implants were limited by insufficient exchange of nutrients and lack of mechanical strength. The intellectual merit of this project is in the concept that osteon-mimetic biomaterial design and fabrication of scaffolds that would overcome some of the fundamental limitations of the earlier skeletal regeneration studies. The three main tasks of the project are to prepare: 1) a hydrogel/apatite composite with controlled physiochemical and biological properties as the soft phase of the tissue construct for uniform cell seeding; 2) osteon-mimetic fiber-reinforced laminated microtubes for the nutrient supply to the seeded cells; and 3) a tissue construct that is comprised of a set of bonded cell-laden microtubes for structural stability. The broader impact lies in the application of biomimetic biomaterial concept to other areas such as heart valve replacement, targeted drug delivery and stem cell therapy. The proposed research is expected to provide students with a unique multidisciplinary environment that integrates materials science and engineering, biochemistry, and biology to design and test novel biomaterials for tissue regeneration. Additionally, the project will utilize the established programs in the campus for the recruitment and training of minority students and these students will be trained in research activities to synthesize and test novel biomaterials for potential cutting-edge biomedical applications in regenerative medicine. <br/> <br/>More than one million fractures each year in the US require intervention, many in the form of bone graft procedures. These include the needs arising from resection of tumors, bone loss due to trauma or infection, age-related fractures, and congenital skeletal deformities. Despite the constant clinical need for bone graft in orthopedic and maxillofacial surgery, the process is beleaguered by the limited supply of bone, morbidity, long recovery time, and cost of the operation. The use of these implant materials is limited by their structural instability and lack of blood supply in the central part of these implants for their timely growth. These drawbacks could lead to long recovery times and integration of these implants in the body. The aim of this project is to develop novel composite materials that are inspired by the natural microstructure of the compact bone, and to overcome some of the limitations of currently used bone graft materials such as their mechanical instability and lack of transport of nutrients and oxygen supply for the maturation of bone in a timely manner. This project creates a unique multidisciplinary environment for teaching and training students. With the use of ongoing program at the campus, this project will recruit underrepresented students from South Carolina, and train them in cutting-edge research techniques in biomaterials for regenerative biomedical applications. In addition, during the summer time, high school students from South Carolina will participate in the biomaterials research activities to encourage them to pursue careers in science and engineering."

The hypothesis is that the ""self-organizing"" properties of limb mesenchymal cells that lead them to generate spatiotemporally arranged precartilage condensations and cartilage nodules in vitro are also utilized in vivo in the generation of the limb skeletal pattern. To test this idea key gene regulatory processes will be identified that are intrinsic to limb bud mesenchyme which provide the basis for its ability to generate precartilage condensations in a spatiotemporally-controlled fashion. Because the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin is a major mediator of precartilage cell condensation both in vitro and in vivo, DNA constructs will be designed to contain the chicken fibronectin gene promoter linked to a readily visualized reporter molecule, Green Fluorescent Protein. The length of normal promoter sequence that directs authentic condensation-associated gene expression in vitro and then mutate the minimal promoter to determine which cis-acting sites are essential for this activity will be identified.  This will permit the delineation of candidate sites for action of developmentally relevant transcription factors such as Fast-1.  The response of these constructs to added growth and differentiation factors such as TGF-B2, and FGF-2, -4 and -8 will be used to help identify endogenous factors that regulate fibronectin expression.  Once the relevant determinants have been characterized in vitro, they will be introduced into embryonic limbs by electroporation or detergent-mediated transfection to ascertain whether or not the establishment of fibronectin ""prepatterns"" for the skeletal primordia in vivo employ the same fibronectin regulatory pathways utilized in the self-organizing processes responsible for the generation of these patterns in vitro."

The basic elements required for successful regeneration of bone include an extracellular matrix scaffold, cells, and bioactive genes or proteins. Whether these elements are provided by the host or must be included within a tissue-engineered construct depends critically on the local biochemical, mechanical, and vascular environments at the defect site. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based approaches to bone regeneration have advanced rapidly in recent years in parallel with an increased understanding of musculoskeletal cell biology. Cellular augmentation is especially important for difficult clinical cases involving older patients, smokers, patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation, and patients with severely damaged wound beds where the endogenous cellular supply may be diminished. Well-characterized in vitro and in vivo test bed systems with quantitative outcome measures are required to evaluate the efficacy of these and other bone tissue-engineering technologies.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to quantifiably compare in vivo and in vitro bone formation within 3D mesenchymal stem cell constructs subjected to identical cyclic mechanical loading conditions.  For all experiments, tissue-engineered constructs will be created by seeding demineralized trabecular bone allografts with MSCs purified from canine marrow aspirates. <br/><br/>In vivo experiments will be conducted using a canine hydraulic bone chamber (HBC) implant model that has been used previously to test bone tissue engineering constructs. Cylindrical MSC constructs measuring 6.35 millimeters in diameter and length will be implanted within bilateral chambers located in the distal femoral metaphyses of canines. The HBC model has the ability to apply a controlled cyclic mechanical stimulus to constructs implanted within the chamber. Separate experiments will evaluate the effects of time, seeding density, and mechanical loading on MSC differentiation and mineralized matrix synthesis in vivo. The amount and organization of mineralized matrix formation will be quantified and compared using microtomography (microCT) imaging and 3D stereology.<br/><br/>Parallel in vitro experiments will be conducted using a novel 3D tissue culture system with the ability to simultaneously perfuse cylindrical cell-seeded constructs in the transverse direction and apply a cyclic axial mechanical stimulus. As in the in vivo experiments, cylindrical MSC constructs measuring 6.35 millimeters in diameter and length will be tested. The effects of time, seeding density, and mechanical loading on in vitro bone formation will be quantified using microCT and 3D stereology. The hypothesis that the 3D tissue culture system will accurately predict the relative effect of experimental variables such as time, seeding density, and mechanical loading on mineralized bone formation in vivo will be tested. <br/><br/>The proposed experiments provide a basis for better understanding the interaction between physical factors in vivo and the efficacy of cell-seeded constructs designed to enhance bone regeneration.

This project seeks to develop a new class of materials that, for the first time, has all of the properties of an ideal implant: it should support body weight and mechanical stress, suppress infection, enhance bone healing, and ultimately dissolve harmlessly as bone tissue grows back. While more than 100 synthetic bone grafts are approved for clinical use, none of them has all of these properties. This research not only addresses the challenges in treating critical-sized large bone defects to restore mobility and independent life of patients, but also significantly reduces the clinical dependence on antibiotics and expensive growth factors, thus reducing associated side effects (e.g., antibiotic resistance) and health care costs. The outcome of this research will lead to the next-generation implants that have the combined advantages of current metallic and polymeric implants while eliminating their problems. More broadly, this project will open up new avenues of research in smart resorbable materials, build the foundation for practical design guidelines, benefit millions of patients with skeletal injuries or diseases, and attract significant interests of implant industry for technology transfer. These, in turn, will increase the competitiveness of U.S. companies in the global medical device market. The integrated research and education plans will also have broader impacts on graduate, undergraduate, and pre-college education as well as public awareness about engineering solutions that benefit health care.

Specifically, the RAOI consists of bioresorbable, biocompatible and mechanically strong magnesium alloys as the bulk substrate and engineered nanostructures on the surface to prevent infection and enhance bone regeneration. The novelty of RAOI design lies in its integrated multifunctionality that can potentially meet ALL criteria for an ideal implant for the first time. To unlock the full potential of magnesium alloys, we must address the critical scientific and engineering challenge of controlling their degradation rate. Our novel approach is to create engineered nanostructures on the surface of magnesium alloys to achieve the three key functions simultaneously: (1) modulate degradation rate of bulk magnesium substrates, (2) reduce adhesion and viability of pathogenic bacteria, and (3) enhance adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells for faster bone healing."

Using a substrate that provides the correct mechanical cues to cells is a promising approach for enhancing tissue repair/regeneration and facilitating tissue-biomaterials integration. Long non-coding ribonucleic acids (LncRNAs) are messenger molecules that are powerful regulators of cell differentiation, development, and important during the progress of cancers.  Since matrix stiffness changes cell functions, the project will test whether stiffness regulates LncRNA production.  One important cell change that we think is associated with LncRNA production is the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT).  This is an essential cellular process in development, tissue repair, scar formation, and cancer development that changes whether the cells are quiescent or migratory. This project will identify LncRNAs that are turned on or off in a matrix stiffness-dependent manner under conditions that cause EMT. The overall goal of this research program is to produce transformative contributions to the current understanding of the role of matrix stiffness signals in LncRNA expression and cell differentiation. By enhancing our understanding of how matrix properties regulate gene expression in cells, results of this research will have broad-ranging impacts in fields as diverse as cell-biomaterial interactions, cell mechanotransduction, and molecular and cell biology of gene regulation.  The PI will will provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to work on independent projects, and  will create a summer course on 'Cell Biomechanics' in collaboration with the University of Maryland's Upward Bound Math-Science program for high school students from underrepresented groups<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to identify and characterize matrix stiffness-sensitive LncRNAs using global expression analysis, and to determine the role of TRPV4 in matrix stiffness-induced LncRNA expression and EMT. Based on the preliminary data, the central hypothesis is that matrix stiffness controls LncRNA expression, and thereby EMT in a manner dependent on TRPV4. Two Specific Aims will test this hypothesis by utilizing molecular strategies involving human and mouse normal primary cells, TRPV4 null and congenic wild-type mice, LncRNA arrays, and in vitro and in vivo models of the EMT. Specific Aim 1 will identify and characterize matrix stiffness-sensitive LncRNAs using in vitro and in vivo model systems. Specific Aim 2 will delineate the association between TRPV4, matrix stiffness-sensitive LncRNAs, and modulation of EMT. When completed, we expect that the results of this study will provide novel information and insight regarding the molecular mechanisms mediating LncRNA expression and EMT."

One such migratory cell type, the neural crest, gives rise to portions of the heart, components of the gut and sensory nervous systems, skin pigment cells, and the craniofacial skeleton.  The formation of migratory neural crest cells is mediated, in part, by the activity of a protein called Snail2.  The central goal of this research project is to delineate the role of Snail2, and the genes Snail2 regulates, during neural crest cell migration. To address this question, various molecular and biochemical experiments will be performed to examine the role of two putative Snail2 target genes, alpha-N-catenin and cingulin, in the neural crest.  The results of this work will reveal the distribution and function of alpha-N-catenin and cingulin in the developing embryo, as well as define the mechanism by which Snail2 regulates alpha-N-catenin and cingulin.  <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal include: 1) the integration of research and teaching at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels, 2) the support of female scientists through participation in the University of Maryland, College Park chapter of the Association for Women in Science, and 3) the generation of important reagents that will be available to the scientific community.  Collectively, this project will help better prepare the next generation of scientists for careers in both academic and non-academic settings, and the proposed experiments will shed light on the processes regulating neural crest cell migration and the fundamental molecular mechanisms controlling the directed movement of cells during embryonic development."

MSC's have the unique ability to change into a variety of different cells, and they can support our immune system by releasing cell signaling molecules depending on the body?s needs. Due to these benefits, biomanufacturing of MSCs has emerged as a vital area of research. However, obtaining cells that exhibit specific functions is difficult because MSCs typically exist as a mixture of cell types. In this project, microfluidic technology is proposed to select cells based on key electrical parameters that have been associated with MSCs that promote healing. This project includes efforts to increase the number of African American undergraduate and high school students pursuing STEM fields.<br/><br/>MSC cultures contain stem cells, partially differentiated progenitor cells, and fully differentiated cells. MSC therapeutic potential is limited by the inability to select specific cell subpopulations. Little is known about the defining characteristics and functional capabilities of all MSC progenitor subtypes within a cell population. This project has 3 goals. The first is to use a label- free cell sorting technique, dielectrophoresis, to target MSC progenitors based on their functionality. The second is to expand the number of biomarkers that can be used to reliably identify MSC progenitors.  The third is to pinpoint the key structural and molecular contributions to cell polarization. This project will attempt to expand the number of independent biomarkers that can be used for cell selection with dielectrophoresis based membrane capacitance and cytoplasm conductivity. The successful completion of these investigations will yield new molecular insights into cell surface molecules regulating differentiation, the release of cell signaling molecules, and gene expression in the mesenchymal lineage. Additionally, we will have an effective dielectrophoresis-based microfluidic device for stem cell sorting to advance biomanufacturing efforts for better cell therapies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed work is an interdisciplinary project that integrates nanotechnology, materials sciences, stem cell biology, and tissue engineering. Low back pain is one of the leading causes of disability and mainly caused by the degeneration of IVD. Current treatment options are limited because they can ease the pain but are unable to completely restore normal functions or promote new tissue regeneration. Thus, this CAREER proposal is transformative because it provides an innovative strategy to regenerate IVD by tackling the current challenges of electrospun nanofibers and self-assembled peptide amphiphiles (PAs) along with promoting multi levels of education and outreach programs. <br/>Electrospinning has gained lots of attention for various biomedical applications. However, the current major challenges facing electrospun nanofiber scaffolds include the lack of bioactivity on the nanofiber surface and the difficulties involved in trying to fabricate porous three dimensional structures. Endowed bioactivity is needed to control the cellular response to the biomaterial. The fabrication of a porous three dimensional electrospun scaffold is vital for cell encapsulation and infiltration because the current electrospun scaffolds are limited by their dense sheet structure. The proposed strategy is designed to overcome both of these challenges by developing bioactive hybrid nanomatrices that combine the unique characteristics of electrospun poly(-caprolactone) (PCL) nanofibers and self-assembled peptide amphiphiles (PAs). The preliminary studies conducted strongly support our hypothesis. In particular, the self-assembled PAs can endow electrospun PCL nanofibers with bioactive properties, and a novel method is under development to fabricate electrospun PCL nanofibers into three dimensional porous structures. <br/>Therefore, the intellectual merit of this proposal is to provide fundamental insight into designing nanostructured, IVD mimicking scaffolds by combining electrospun nanofibers and self-assembled PAs. These bioactive hybrid nanomatrices are expected to overcome the current challenges of both electrospun nanofibers and PAs along with using their unique advantages. The electrospun PCL nanofibers will be coated with self-assembled PAs, thus endowing the PCL nanofibers with bioactive properties. These bioactive hybrid nanofibers will be characterized, and optimal coating conditions will be determined. Furthermore, the electrospun PCL nanofibers will be fabricated into a porous three dimensional structure using the newly developed method and then embedded in self-assembled PA gels to create bioactive hybrid nanomatrices. These nanomatrices will provide encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) with an ideal IVD mimicking environment via characteristic cell adhesive ligands and tunable mechanical properties. Cellular responses to these different environments will be evaluated in order to develop a comprehensive strategy for IVD regeneration <br/>The proposed research will also have the broad impact across multiple levels of education and outreach programs (graduate, undergraduate, high, and middle school): a. thesis based research activities for graduate and undergraduate students in nanostructured biomaterials and stem cell based tissue regeneration; b. development of a new interdisciplinary curriculum by combining lectures and hands-on laboratory activities; c. development of two new community outreach programs for the promotion of leadership and career opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities in middle school and high school; d. development of a new outreach program targeting students with disabilities, and e. development of industrial and international partnership for improving multidisciplinary training and collaboration skills."

The Global Venture Fund program in the Office of International Science and Engineering is also supporting this project. Although numerous soft-tissue replacement constructs have been developed previously, less attention has been dedicated in recreating the interface between the engineered replacement soft-tissue and the hard bone. The proposed tissue construct will be prepared from a composite hydrogel reinforced with polycaprolactone nanofibers, and seeded by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In order to mimic the structure of native soft tissue-to-bone interface, biochemical and biophysical cues will be modulated along the length of the tissue construct to drive the differentiation of MSCs down the chondrogenic, fibrocartilaginous, and ligamentous pathways. With this design of the tissue graft, the end part of the bone tissue will be established by promoting endochondral ossification of the chondrogenically primed portion of the construct following in vivo implantation of stem cells. This approach is unique and innovative in providing a spatially graded engineered tissue grafts with the capacity to promote the formation of an intermediary soft tissue template, which will differentiate into appropriate end-stage tissue phenotypes in response to local environmental cues. This strategy is to recapitulate different aspects of the developmental process, where all tissues are derived from soft tissue precursors and specific environmental cues are critical to determining end-stage differentiation. With respect to educational and training aspects of the project, this work will involve the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a broad range of innovative tissue engineering and biomaterial design techniques.

This interface is necessary for the proper functionality of the entire joint. This project seeks to recreate the interface between soft tissue and bone using a novel biomaterial construct that mimics the structure and function of the native interface. In addition to innovative research, this grant will use outreach activities to emphasize the education of students and the general public. Graduate students and undergraduate students who participate in this research will learn both biological and engineering techniques and will have opportunities to attend conferences to disseminate research and strengthen international collaborations. This work will also provide engineering experience to pre-college students in encouraging their participation in research.

The conference sessions will discuss the evolutionary origins of these essential structures, and how they work during development to form these different types of cells and organs. The NC&CP GRC is held in a setting that allows scientists at all levels to discuss problems and advances in studying these embryo structures.  The program will also allow opportunities to mentor young scientists of all backgrounds, including an informal forum to discuss the professional growth and challenges women face in science, and a Graduate Research Seminar organized and run by junior scientists. This seminar enables junior researchers to present their data in an informal, peer-group setting, so they gain confidence and camaraderie, and includes a faculty-led Career Mentorship Panel discussion, ""The Different Faces of Academic Research.""  A diverse set of speakers has been assembled, with 19 further talks, selected from submitted abstracts, to be presented by women, under-represented minorities, and junior researchers.<br/><br/>The Neural Crest and Cranial Placodes Gordon Research Conference (NC&CP GRC) uniquely considers two distinct embryonic cell types, the neural crest and the cranial placodes, that have traditionally been studied separately. These embryonic structures together contribute to a wide variety of cell types during development, including the entire peripheral nervous system, sense organs, pigment cells, the craniofacial skeleton, and teeth. Neural crest and cranial placodes are derived from adjacent domains within the early ectoderm and their initial patterning is influenced by coordinated signals. They provide integrated, experimentally tractable systems for investigating a broad array of fundamental questions in cell, developmental, evolutionary, and systems biology. Study of neural crest cells has pioneered the understanding of fundamental properties of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions as well as cell migration, and has been instrumental in defining general stem cell properties across numerous tissue populations. The use of systems biology methods to construct the gene regulatory networks that control vertebrate development has been pioneered in the study of neural crest and cranial placodes. The emergence and diversification of the neural crest and cranial placodes is thought to have been critical for vertebrate evolution. This conference will bring together a diverse group of scientists in a collegial atmosphere to foster substantive discussions and promote collaboration. It will accelerate the exchange of information across different model systems, include an evolutionary perspective, promote technological innovations, and advance understanding of the underlying cellular mechanisms governing the formation, cellular behavior, and differentiation of these two critical embryonic populations."

Gene expression is guided by proteins called transcription factors. The transcription factor TWIST is important for the formation of different cell types by helping induce changes that cause epithelial cells to become mesenchymal cells during the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although EMT is required for proper organ development, EMT also endows cells with potentially detrimental migration and invasion properties, and thus must be tightly regulated. This project will provide a better understanding of how EMT is controlled by defining specific mechanisms that change the molecular structure and activity of TWIST by using a novel platform to rapidly identify proteins that recognize these changes in molecular structure. Overall, the project will also provide an ideal opportunity for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral scientists in molecular biology and proteomics, as well as introducing elementary, high school, and undergraduate students, particularly those in underrepresented minority groups, to basic science research and advanced technology. In addition, this project will provide science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) opportunities in a rural area with few options for students with STEM interests through established educational and community outreach programs. <br/><br/>Information is relayed from the cell surface into the nucleus through the process of signal transduction. Signal transduction is driven by protein interactions that are controlled by posttranslational modifications (PTM). Typically, a specific protein domain on one protein recognizes or ?reads? the PTM signal present on its interacting partners. This project will address fundamental questions regarding the crosstalk between PTMs in the regulation of transcriptional programs that govern EMT. A recently discovered regulatory node on the transcription factor TWIST1 potentially harbors a combinatorial code consisting of three distinct PTMs that occur within six amino acid residues of each other. The code is established through lysine and arginine methylation by SETD6 and PRMT1, respectively, and lysine ubiquitinylation by RNF8. The project seeks to define the molecular crosstalk among these enzymes, and how they function to promote EMT through TWIST1. An important part of dissecting the molecular mechanism of signaling through this methyl/ubiquitin node on TWIST1 is a novel protein domain microarray platform that will be used to rapidly identify protein-protein interactions dependent upon specific PTMs and combinations of PTMs. This platform will help answer fundamental questions including: 1) which protein domains bind each of these different PTMs in the TWIST1 methyl/ubiquitin regulatory node; and 2) whether specific combinations of these PTMs block or facilitate protein interactions? This study will provide not only a basic mechanistic understanding of how the distinct PTMs on TWIST regulate each other, and how they regulate interactions with other proteins, in the context of EMT, but also a broader perspective on how PTMs might regulate protein-protein interactions in general. <br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MSCs contain precursors that are able to differentiate into numerous types of cells but with a much lower risk of tumorigenicity. The heterogeneity of the bone marrow stem cell population makes it difficult to resolve the conflicting data on MSC plasticity. The specificity of current markers available to identify MSCs fails to separate the populations of structurally distinct cells. Hence, strategies that isolate and maintain the subpopulations of MSCs would transform the field of stem cell biology. In this work, a novel hypothesis for separating and isolating pure populations of stem cells will be tested.  To test this hypothesis, investigators will use an integrative approach that couples mechanics modeling with experiments to predict the surface properties required to maintain subpopulations of MSCs. This will eventually facilitate a more uniform cell population to be established and studied for their capacity to differentiate into specific lineages, thereby enhancing their differentiation efficiency. The PI will integrate research into curriculum at Michigan State University and engage graduate, undergraduate and high school students in research in this multidisciplinary area."

The work will lead to new treatments to improve nationwide health. One way to study how diseases affect women and men differently is to include people with Turner Syndrome. Like men, people with Turner Syndrome have only one X chromosome, but they are born with female features. The goal of this research is to identify X chromosome genes that regulate how heart valve cells respond to forces. This force response affects the development of the bicuspid aortic valve, and can create a birth defect. This problem is more common in men than in women, but is 50 times more common in people with Turner Syndrome. People with a bicuspid aortic valve and Turner Syndrome often need to have their aortic valves replaced at a relatively young age. Unfortunately, it is very hard to detect bicuspid aortic valve disease, even with imaging. This research will lead to new treatments for patients who need surgical valve replacement.

Like men, people with Turner Syndrome have only one X chromosome, but they are born with female features. The goal of this research is to identify X chromosome genes that regulate how heart valve cells respond to forces. This force response affects the development of the bicuspid aortic valve, and can create a birth defect. This problem is more common in men than in women, but is 50 times more common in people with Turner Syndrome.

How cells communicate and govern these fundamental biological processes are highly complex and dynamic, and their behavior is very difficult to predict from knowledge of the individual parts. Therefore, the question arises how we should analyze and understand such complexity and which measurement technologies will prove most useful. Recently, several high-throughput approaches for collecting large-scale datasets, particularly those involving gene expression, have unlocked the door to data-driven systems biology-based projects.  However, studying many interactions, even in a closely interconnected network, is powerful, but it is often hard to see the forest for the trees. Most often, system biologists rely on mathematical and computational models to analyze large-scale datasets and use these models to make scientific breakthroughs. To inspire and train the next generation of scientists in both experimental and computational approaches, this project will provide an opportunity for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds to learn both cutting-edge cell biology-based experimentation and computational methods for formulating, simplifying, and extracting critical information from large-scale quantitative experimental data. A combination of hands-on training and lesson plans on the concept of 'cellular decision-making' for high school teachers will further promote data-driven biology among high school students. The graduate students and postdoctoral fellows working on this project will integrate experimental and mathematical modeling techniques that can be applied to broad areas of biology. This quantitative research theme will be carried forward by mentorship to high school students and through public engagement activities with the local community. <br/><br/>The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a central mechanism for diversifying the cells found in complex tissues. During EMT, epithelial cells adopt mesenchymal properties by altering their morphology, cellular architecture, adhesion, and migratory capacity. Several growth factors, including TGF-beta and Wnt, have been shown to trigger the EMT in both embryonic development as well as normal and transformed cells. However, a mechanistic and integrated understanding of how these various factors cooperate to induce the EMT in epithelial cells or transdifferentiation in fibroblast is still lacking. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated understanding of how Wnt and TGF-beta pathways control fundamental cell biological and developmental processes of EMT and cell migration. The research project will reveal mechanistic insights into how Wnt signaling drives EMT and promotes cell migration, and determine whether cooperation between Wnt and TGF-beta signaling is necessary for EMT. The project will also provide a biochemical portrait to determine how proteins in the Wnt pathway interact and interconnect with TGF-beta signaling and determine how these connections change as epithelial cells undergo transdifferentiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, they are key players in repair mechanisms as impairment of stem cell functionality is directly related to disease models including cancer. Cells in their native environment are constantly subjected to both biochemical and biophysical signals. While the role of biochemical cues on stem cell behavior is well documented, only recently have we begun to understand the role of biophysical cues. In this context, very little is known on the role of ubiquitous forces cells feel or exert constantly during differentiation. This award funds fundamental research in determining these forces and their role in stem cell differentiation. The new knowledge will allow development of scaffolds capable of providing simultaneous biochemical and biophysical factors specific to a cell type, thus impacting both developmental and disease biology. This research involves multiple disciplines including engineering (mechanical, biomedical), polymer physics, biology and mathematics under the umbrella of rapidly growing mechanobiology. The knowledge from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society, while also providing pathways for increased participation of underrepresented groups in research and engineering.<br/><br/>This research plans to build extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking nanofiber-based scaffolds called 'nanonets' as force measurement probes. Nanonets are composed of aligned and suspended nanofibrous assemblies of a mix of diameters, lengths, and spacing in double layer configuration. Furthermore, nanonets contain fused fiber intersections, which allow migrating single cells to deflect fiber segments, thus providing a measure of forces using inverse methods. This multiscale approach will permit simultaneous investigations on the role of biophysical (curvature, structural stiffness (N/m)) and biochemical (growth factor concentrations) cues on differentiation of single human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (h-MSCs) attached to suspended nanonets. This will allow development of a set of force-differentiation (F-D) master curves calibrating the optimal biophysical and biochemical contributions to mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. The fundamental knowledge will contribute significantly by unraveling the role of cell-ECM mechanobiological interactions at the single-cell level and provide insights in development of implantable platforms for tissue regeneration, wound healing sutures, single cell force measurement assays for early diagnosis and drug testing for a wide variety of diseases including cancer."

Important biological properties of the cells that predict how they could spread in the body and make new tumors will be measured and compared between the softer and stiffer cell groups. Finally the project will develop a computer model of the cell to explain how differences in which genes are active cause them to be stiff or soft.

Therefore, alterations of the mechanical properties of individual cells can reveal important insights into changes in these molecular networks. For example, invasive tumor cells typically soften mechanically, which thereby enhance their capacity to escape from a primary tumor. However, the mechanical variation within a given cell type can be substantial, which not only limits the specificity of cell mechanical measurements, but also poses an intriguing and unanswered question: why do cell mechanical properties vary between similar cells? The objective of this research is to understand how variations in gene expression can lead to variations of cellular mechanics between populations of cells as well as within populations of cells. This study will examine the correlation between cellular mechanical properties (modulus, viscous relaxation, and size) and gene expression, on a cell by cell basis. Two unique experimental measurements will be conducted. First, individual cells will be measured biomechanically with atomic force microscopy and subsequently analyzed for gene expression of mechanically relevant genes previously identified to be differentially expressed from population studies of ovarian healthy and cancer cells. Second, a biophysical cell sorting device will be used to obtain cells of stiffer and softer phenotypes. Each sorted group of cells will be examined for functional and gene expression differences. Finally, the experimental results will be used to inform a multiscale computational model of the cell to explain how biological variation (e.g. crosslinking density) can lead to biophysical variation. The study will delineate the fundamental aspects of the mechanical properties of living cells, particularly cytoskeleton crosslinking, nuclear membrane, and micromechanical changes due to dynamical processes on short time scales (e.g. cell cycle) and longer time scales (e.g. epithelial to mesenchymal transition). This project will answer questions such as whether softer subtypes of noninvasive cells can nonetheless show metastatic-like migration. Knowledge of the biophysics of metastasis of ovarian cancer cells may lead to new diagnostic and treatment approaches based upon detecting and inhibiting specific cell biophysical phenotypes.

Although such materials provide an initially well-defined microenvironment for the cells, little is known about how migrating cells degrade and remodel synthetic scaffolds. The lack of quantitative and predictable information about this process has limited advances in biomaterial design. To bridge this gap, characterizing a 3D hydrogel matrix remodeled by encapsulated cells using both macro- and microrheological measurements will enable quantitative evaluation of the material properties in the region directly around the cell, the pericellular region, before the onset of and during cell migration. <br/>Specifically, we propose experiments to determine material properties and the length scale of scaffold heterogeneity during the degradation reaction. Bulk rheology will be used to supplement microrheology enabling measurements of the complete gelation reaction. Finally, measurements conducted in the presence of an encapsulated migratory cell line, specifically human mesenchymal stem cells, will be performed to better understand how rheological changes in the pericellular region correlate with cell morphology, focal adhesions and motility. This approach to understanding cell migration, focusing on the fundamental rheological changes within the hydrogel, has the potential to transform many fields including but not limited to rheology of soft materials, 3D cell culture, tissue regeneration and biomaterials development.<br/><br/>Broader impacts: The information gained during these studies will increase knowledge about cell remodeling during migration. The proposed research will have a significant impact on the intellectual advances and broader technological developments in several fields including wound healing, tissue engineering and stem cell culture.

The data from this study will be utilized to significantly improve approaches to engineer functional vascularized bone grafts for regenerative medicine.

During vascularized bone formation in cell culture models, mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into pericytes (to stabilize the nascent vasculature) and osteoblasts (to deposit mineral). This decision to become pericyte or osteoblasts varies as a function of both space and time in culture. Both cell types are critical for the formation and maintenance of the appropriate tissue organization yet it remains unclear how the perivascular microenvironment impacts the lineage specification of stem cells into either of these particular phenotypes. By combining tissue engineering cell-culture models with molecular biology techniques it is possible to explore the intricate cell-fate decisions that regulate complex tissue formation. This proposal tests the hypothesis that regulating the pericyte/osteoblast lineage commitment of mesenchymal stem cells as a function of space (proximity to vascular structures) and time underlies the potential to form integrated vascular networks and mineralized bone deposits. There are three primary research objectives: (i) Determine the effect of cell composition and growth factor delivery on the structure and organization of tissue engineered vascularized bone. (ii) Evaluate effect of growth factor concentration and spatial gradients on tissue structure.

Although the role of many soluble factors and extracellular matrix molecules in MSC differentiation has been examined, the role of cell-cell interactions remains unexplored. This project is based on an innovative research plan to understand the role of cell-cell interactions in stem cell differentiation and to develop novel strategies to tune stem cell fate decisions by controlling the extent of cell-to-cell adhesion.

Differentiation of MSCs is affected by many soluble and insoluble signals in the local microenvironment. In addition to soluble growth factors, cell-extracellular matrix interactions and substrate mechanics have been implicated in stem cell lineage commitment. However, the mechanical and biochemical signals originating from cell-to-cell adhesion remain unexplored in this context. Recent studies implicated adherens junctions in the maintenance of embryonic stem cell self-renewal potential and during cellular reprogramming, but the role of cell-cell interactions in MSC differentiation remains elusive. Therefore, the overarching hypothesis of the proposed work is that cell-to-cell adhesion affects stem cell fate decisions.  This hypothesis will be addressed by a series of mechanistic studies to understand the role of Cadherin-11 on MSC differentiation into smooth muscle cells.  Methods to be employed include novel microfabrication technologies to control the extent of cell-cell interactions, and the novel lentiviral array (LVA) technology developed in the PI's laboratory to monitor in real time multiple genes and pathways during MSC differentiation.  The proposed work represents a significant step forward in understanding the role of cell-to-cell adhesion in stem cell differentiation and will enable design of strategies, biomaterials and devices for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Finally, although the proposed work will focus on MSCs, the research findings are expected to impact other types of stem cells, such as cancer stem cells, where intercellular interactions may also play an important role."

Recent research in the area of in vitro cell growth has led to a number of important discoveries with regards to how cells behave and respond to their environment. These discoveries have significantly altered the way that researchers think about how cells grow; however, few commercial products reflecting this knowledge exist, possibly causing bottlenecks in applications ranging from in vitro fertilization (IVF) to disease model development for pharmaceutical testing. The project will result in a family of cell culture substrate prototypes designed to improve cell growth and development over the traditional flat polystyrene surfaces currently used in the industry today.  The prototypes will be designed for high-volume manufacturing to ensure commercial usefulness and cost-effectiveness in the biomedical sector. <br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  First, traditional silicon tooling for multi-scale molding at the micro/nanoscale is cost-prohibitive.  Second, the high-volume manufacturing of injection-molded polymeric devices that possess features at the low micro to nanoscale is currently limited by factors such as tooling life and manufacturing robustness.  Third, a robust in vitro cell response to such products is required for future commercialization.  To address these technology gaps, the team will employ designs inspired by native cell environments, using a well-established in vitro cell growth assay for mouse embryos. Molds for high volume manufacturing will be produced using bulk metallic glass tooling, on which mold robustness will be analyzed.  Polymer rheology will be controlled in a variety of ways to ensure feature consistency and reproducibility.  Costs associated with mold production and other tooling will be built into the current working financial model to determine the next phase of the commercialization effort.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a graduate student and a team of undergraduate/high school students will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experience by developing the designs, talking to potential customers, and aiding with the development of a commercialization plan for the technology."

This approach has already established its potential in several medical arenas. But despite the obvious advantages afforded by these targeted therapies compared to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, the complexity and costs of producing genetically-programmed lymphocytes pose major obstacles to their use as standard-of-care. This project addresses the problem by developing microscopic ""nanoparticles"" that can stimulate, genetically modify, and selectively expand therapeutic lymphocytes simply by adding them to the cells in culture. Nanoparticles can be repeatedly added to the cell culture until the required numbers of engineered lymphocytes are achieved. Implementing the large-scale manufacture of targeted T cells afforded by this approach could translate into treating patients with an immunotherapy that is practical, low-cost, and broadly-applicable. Furthermore, the project will help develop the scientists of tomorrow through its participation in ongoing teaching and outreach programs designed to generate enthusiasm in students learning how new developments in biomaterials impact medicine. <br/><br/>Current lymphocyte manufacturing practices require an assortment of elaborate protocols to isolate, genetically modify, and selectively expand the redirected cells before infusing them back into the patient. Because these difficult procedures entail dedicated equipment and considerable technical expertise, providing this kind of personalized T cell therapy to every cancer patient in the United States is not practical. This project addresses the problem by developing microscopic ""nanoparticles"" that can stimulate, genetically modify, and selectively expand therapeutic lymphocytes simply by adding them to the cells in culture. The project tests the hypothesis that appropriately engineered DNA-carrying nanoparticles can efficiently shuttle tumor-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) genes into cultured T cells (CAR-T cells), and at the same time induce the selective outgrowth of the genetically-modified lymphocyte population by presenting the cells with the same surface-anchored antigens that are targeted by the encoded CAR. The hypothesis is tested via two specific aims: 1) designing the proposed DNA nanocarriers and 2) comparing the functionality and therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T cells manufactured using the proposed DNA nanocarriers versus those created by the conventional approach using viral methods and magnetic bead expansion. The nanoparticle-based methods will be able to activate, engineer, and propagate T cells without special instruments, equipment, or training and could be manufactured using automated protocols that are compatible with any clinical setting, and at a fraction of the costs involved in multistep/multi-reagent methods. Nanoparticles can be repeatedly added to the culture until the required percentage of programmed T cells is achieved. They are biodegradable and biocompatible and the expanded T cells can easily be separated from free nanoparticles by centrifugation. The platform could easily be adapted to enable economical commercial-scale manufacturing of other therapeutic cell types, such as natural killer cells, hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, or B lymphocytes, which substantially broadens the applicability of the approach for the treatment of disease."

While these cell-based therapies provide a possible avenue to restore function and improve quality of life, current limitations in their translation include the inability to control the differentiation of the stem cells, low survival of the transplanted cells, etc.  Biomaterial systems that provide the right signals to these cells could help overcome many of these problems.  To address this significant need, this project will develop advanced biomaterial systems for the culture of bone-marrow derived stem cells, and the materials and methods will allow us to better understand which signals are important and how they should be presented to the cells.  We expect that this research will translate into new biomaterial systems for the delivery of adult stem cells that will improve their safety and efficacy.  During this research, graduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art methods at the interface of biology with engineering, and prepared for scientific careers in areas of national need (e.g., biomaterials, medical devices, and drug delivery).  The team will also integrate undergraduate students and high school students as part of a sustained effort to communicate this work to the local public through outreach programs.  In addition to publication of results that will be broadly accessible, we will also continue to develop hands-on demonstrations for visiting secondary students, teachers and parents, as the visual aspects of imaging cells in 3D captures the attention and excitement of many prospective future scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>This award supports the development of hydrogel biomaterials for the culture of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). hMSCs are adult stem cells that are being used in numerous clinical trials to promote healing of injured or diseased tissues.  With this award, hydrogel scaffolds will be synthesized and characterized that allow one to introduce important biological signals at the interface of the biomaterial matrix with the hMSCs.  The approach exploits a thiol-ene reaction mechanism and particularly an allyl-sulfide functionality.   Many thiol-containing biomacromolecules (e.g., proteins, peptides) can be conjugated to the ally-sulfide moieity through reversible exchange reactions, which allow user-controlled modification of the scaffold biochemical functionality.  Since the expansion and controlled differentiation of hMSCs often involves sequential presentation of biological signals, the materials developed as part of this award will allow us to study and engineer systems for improved culture of hMSCs, as well as design improved hMSC delivery vehicles for therapeutic applications.  As part of this research, students at multiple levels (high school, undergraduate and graduate) will be trained in polymer and peptide synthesis, bioconjugation techniques, hydrogel characterization, stem cell culture and advanced light microscopy methods.  The knowledge learned from this research will be integrated into course content in advanced Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering courses, as well as communicated to the general public through numerous outreach programs at the University of Colorado."

Novel electrospinning protocols will be developed for the fabrication of fibrous, elastomeric scaffolds that facilitate the infiltration and attachment of stem cells, and at the same time mediate their lineage-specific differentiation. The proposed hybrid systems overcome the major limitations of existing scaffolding materials and are conducive to the successful engineering of mechanically active tissues. The proposed research program integrates well with the University's effort to establish a new biomedical engineering department, providing a fertile biomaterials training ground for undergraduate and graduate students at Univ. of Delaware. It will also allow the investigators work with teachers at the Newark Center for Creative Learning to advance science education and experimental learning.<br/><br/>Tissue engineering is a fast-growing field that aims to create artificial tissues or organs to replace damaged or diseased ones. In healthy tissue, cells reside in a three-dimensional matrix that provides proper mechanical support and developmental guidance. To create artificial replacement tissues, one must recreate the environment in which the cells originally live. The artificial scaffolds must be highly porous, display important biological signals and be able to sustain repetitive mechanical deformation without breaking down. The purpose of this research is to develop such materials that can be used to coax cells to grow, communicate with each other and to produce their own matrices with the correct composition, structure and function. This will be accomplished by combining a base material with the desired mechanical properties with an engineered, protein-like macromolecule that contains repetitive segments of synthetic polymers and natural peptides, through a novel electrospinning process to create matrices with fibers at the nanometer length scale. This work will enable the creation of sophisticated biomaterials to improve human health, thus justifying the public support.

In addition to the important role for these active mechanical components of the environment (i.e., forces and the resulting stresses and strains), it has become increasingly clear over the past decade that the passive mechanical environment (i.e., the local mechanical or material properties of the environment) also impacts cellular function. Based on the Principal Investigators? ongoing work in this area, a conceptual model explaining how the active and passive mechanical environments interact to regulate cellular function has been developed. The proposed studies will critically evaluate this model using two model biological systems - microvascular network formation by endothelial cells and morphological changes / differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. These studies will utilize an extracellular matrix biomimetic developed by the applicants that allows for independent control of aspects of the active and passive mechanical environments within a three-dimensional cell-compatible setting. The major scientific goals of the proposed work are 1) to expand the capabilities of these existing extracellular matrix biomimetics as a tool to rigorously evaluate the conceptual model of cellular responses to active and passive mechanical environments and 2) to use the extracellular matrix biomimetics to answer important scientific questions related to how cells respond to their mechanical environments, and 3) to integrate research and education to train the next generation of biomedical engineering researchers in mechanobiology. Specific questions to be addressed, which cannot be answered with currently available materials, include the following: What are the independent contributions of matrix stiffness and matrix adhesiveness to cellular function in a 3D environment? For a given cell type in a 3D environment, why does the ideal stiffness for differentiated cell behavior appear to depend on the specific biomaterial? How are the effects of matrix stiffness modulated by cell-matrix adhesion and/or force generation by the cells? What molecular and cellular level processes are modulated by changes in the mechanical stiffness of the matrix and how do these molecular and cellular level processes contribute to observed changes in differentiated multi-cellular structures. The answers to these questions will be explored using microvascular network formation as the primary model system in the proposed studies. Since the formation of multi-cellular, branched microvascular networks involves many coordinated cellular behaviors (e.g., adhesion, elongation, migration, and cell-cell junction formation) important in other physiological, pathological, and tissue engineering settings, the knowledge gained from the proposed studies will likely translate to other important systems including the vascularization of engineered tissues. Additional work with mesenchymal stem cells will provide information about the interplay between the active and passive mechanical environments during cell differentiation in a second relevant cell system."

The piezoelectric material acts as a highly sensitive mechanoelectrical transducer that will generate charges in response to minute mechanical deformations.  By developing a piezoelectric, fibrous scaffold, the team can achieve a local electric field, which is a physical property similar to the natural extracelluar matrix observed during development and regeneration.  This work focuses specifically on the design and characterization of these scaffolds for total joint replacement, i.e., for the reconstruction of cartilage and the underlying bone tissue, due to its vital clinical need, and therefore, will have significant impact on the fields of smart materials and tissue regeneration.  Two specific aims will be addressed.  Aim 1 will fabricate and fully characterize the piezoelectric properties of the scaffold.  Piezoelectric polyvinylidine fluoride trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFE) fibrous scaffolds will be fabricated and characterized for electrical output in conditions that more closely mimic the biological setting.  Piezoelectric scaffolds will be characterized for localized nanoscale electromechanical behavior using a novel microcopy technique as well as bulk properties in order to correlate biological response with electromechanical activity.  Aim 2 will investigate the osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on the piezoelectric scaffold in vitro.  The PI hypothesizes that the use of a fibrous scaffold having similar physical properties as the native extracellular matrix will stimulate the differentiation of MSCs.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  This study involves use of a novel smart material for use, in combination with stem cells, as a tissue engineering medium for regenerating severe cartilage defects.  The studies propose a series of integrated investigations combining advances in materials science with engineering characterization techniques, nanomaterial characterization, microelectronics, stem cell bioengineering, and molecular biology/bioengineering techniques.  The proposed studies will have significant impact in the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, smart materials, and biomaterials.  The insights gained in the application of piezoelectric materials to stem cell bioengineering will also be of relevance to cell biologists and developmental biologists, since piezoelectric extracellular matrices are present during embryogenesis and wound healing.  This project will have a significant impact on the recruitment and mentoring of underrepresented minorities and women in Biomedical Engineering.  The PI is an active mentor in three programs that expose minorities and female students to engineering topics and projects as early as the elementary and junior high school levels.  She will continue to be a mentor in the American Chemical Society Project SEED program, in which junior and senior level high school students from the Newark, NJ community conduct research projects in the PI's laboratory (two students per summer).  Each summer, these students will participate in obtaining results for aims 1 and 2 by learning stem cell differentiation assays and the fabrication of the electrospun meshes.  The PI will also continue to participate in the NJIT FEMME program, which impacts 150 elementary to junior high school female students each summer and provides students with tours and hands-on demonstrations of tissue engineering and biomaterials projects in the PI's laboratory.  In addition, the PI will continue to mentor minority undergraduate students in the NJIT McNair Postbaccalaurate Achievement Program, through which the PI will work with one to two undergraduate students per year as a research mentor on the proposed project."

Once such a regimen has been developed, resultant devices will be implanted intramuscularly in a rat model to explore cell delivery efficiency and host response to the cell-loaded fibrin microthread device. The resultant cell seeding data will provide insight into the extent to which cell seeding efficiency in vitro may be manipulated by simplistic modifications to common seeding conditions including vessel geometry, cell concentration, and total cell load.

The innovative bone graft material is important in treating patients involved in vehicle accidents, cancer patients following tumor resection, soldiers involved in blast injuries, or children with congenital craniofacial injuries that require large amounts of bone graft to maintain continuity. The project will result in a prototype bone graft as an alternative to allograft or demineralized bone for reconstruction of segmental femur or tibia defects. The unique feature of this bone substitute technology is that the material mimics the natural structure and composition of dense cortical bone. This unique feature provides a safe, mechanically-stable, and resorbable graft that stimulates bone formation without eliciting an immune response and is ultimately displaced by the patient's own tissue. This results in a more sustainable healing solution when compared to the leading allograft products in the market.  <br/><br/>This project addresses the gap in technology for an autologous bone graft in treating patients with large, traumatic segmental bone defects. A biomimetic approach is used to produce a scaffold structure similar to that of natural dense cortical bone in order to overcome the technological gap in insufficient strength as well as tunable resorption of the graft concurrent with bone formation. In this approach, osteoconductive microsheets are generated by nucleating calcium phosphate crystals on nanofibers functionalized with calcium-chelating peptides. Next, rigid, load-bearing scaffolds are generated by the wrapping and fusion of the microsheets into a cortical-bone-like cylindrical structure. Then, an array of microchannels are formed on the surface of the cylindrical structure by laser micro-drilling to form an interconnected network of Haversian- and Volkmann-like canals for tunable resorption and uniform nutrient transport in the scaffold. The biomimetic scaffold is loaded with bone morphogenetic protein-2 to produce a graft for recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells and regulation of stem cell fate toward bone formation. The outcome of this project is a non-immunogenic, mechanically-stable, conductive, and inductive bone graft ultimately displaced by the patient?s own tissue for a more sustainable healing solution. In addition, biomedical engineering undergraduates, doctoral students, and post-doctoral researchers involved in this project will receive training in entrepreneurship and technology translation through interviewing the people in different parts of the product ecosystem in collaboration with mentors at the Faber Entrepreneurship Center and the Office of Technology Commercialization at the University."

The strategy involves working with three distinct but interrelated ""models"" for this process: (i) a readily manipulable in vitro experimental model utilizing high-density ('micromass"") cultures of avian limb mesenchymal cells; (ii) a conceptual developmental model that focuses on experimentally confirmed gene expression-growth factor-cell behavioral interactions common to the in vivo and in vitro patterning process; and (iii) a discrete cellular automaton (CA)-based computational model that has been shown to capture, in a semi-quantitative sense, the major features of the in vitro model, under assumptions that derive from the developmental model. The key interactions specified by the<br/>computational model ultimately can be integrated into a multiscale, continuous representation of limb development in vivo. Before this is possible, however, it is necessary to determine whether these interactions uniquely simulate chondrogenic pattern formation in vitro, and whether introduction of additional, experimentally-confirmed molecular interactions and geometrical considerations increases or decreases the fidelity of the model to the in vitro results.<br/><br/>The computational model is an ""agent-oriented"" model that represents cells by points on a lattice which obey rules motivated by experimental findings. The ""cells"" follow these rules as autonomous agents, interacting with other cells and with microenvironments produced by cell activities. The rules include random cell motion, production and lateral deposition of a substrate adhesion molecule corresponding to fibronectin, production and release of a diffusible activator, corresponding to TGF-B that stimulates production of the SAM, and another diffusible factor (""inhibitor"") that suppresses the activity of the activator. The cellular automaton is modeled on a 2- dimensional square lattice to emulate the quasi-2D micromass culture.<br/><br/>The Newman laboratory will misexpress and inhibit expression of TGF-B , fibronectin, FGF2 and 8 (elicitors of lateral inhibition) and candidate inhibitory molecules in vitro and compare pattern results with corresponding manipulations of the CA model; Dr. Alber and his associates will refine the CA model so as to provide cells with more realistic shapes, allow them to move and accumulate in a third dimension, cause them to exhibit differential adhesion, and will develop a set of quantitative methods for pattern analysis, applicable to both micromass cultures and simulations, so as to facilitate detailed comparison between in vitro and in silico results.<br/><br/>Broader impact: The project can be expected to yield several benefits that extend beyond the particular scientific problem addressed. The cellular automata approach is a general tool that can provide developmental biologists working in the area of pattern formation with a way of designing experiments, making predictions, and testing hypotheses. The cross-disciplinary nature of the project will provide a prototype for collaborative efforts by experimental biologists and mathematical, physical, and computational scientists. The work will also have educational value by providing interdisciplinary research experience to graduate students in experimental biology and applied mathematics, who will all spend time in the research groups of the alternate field.<br/>"

Specifically, the proposal examines a key transcriptional gene regulatory network (GRN) in early sea urchin development. This GRN drives the specification and differentiation of the large micromere-primary mesenchyme cell (PMC) lineage. The large micromeres and their descendants transmit critical inductive signals early in development and later execute a dramatic sequence of morphogenetic behaviors, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, direction cell migration, cell fusion, and secretion of a biomineralized skeleton.<br/><br/>The proposal also addresses the long-standing problem of embryonic regulation. How can early differential gene expression in embryos, entrained in the unfertilized egg, be reconciled with labile blastomere fates during early development? Sea urchin embryos are famous for their regulative properties and some of the most spectacular examples involve ectopic specification of PMCs. Although the PMC GRN is normally activated only in the large micromeres, any blastomere of the early cleavage stage embryo can give rise to PMCs under<br/>appropriate experimental conditions. Recent progress in identifying gene networks and signaling pathways that control early sea urchin development provides a new opportunity to address the historic problem of embryonic regulation in a modern context.<br/><br/>Specific Aim 1 examines the PMC GRN as it is deployed during normal development.<br/>1) Dr. Ettensohn will identify mechanisms that normally restrict activation of the GRN specifically to the large micromere lineage, focussing on the roles of beta-catenin levels and unequal cell division. Using molecular biological and pharmacological methods, we will manipulate levels of nuclear beta-catenin and patterns of cell division in early blastomeres and determine whether this causes ectopic activation of the PMC GRN.<br/>2) He will use fluorescent, multiplex in situ hybridization and intron probes to determine the temporal order of activation of genes in the network. This information will be critical in elucidating potential regulatory interactions between genes. <br/>3) He will expand the PMC GRN by identifying new components, including downstream ""morphoregulatory"" genes. This will be accomplished by scaling-up a successful pilot PMC EST project which identified several critical genes in the GRN. The overarching goal is to develop a complete picture of this GRN that links the earliest molecular patterning events in the embryo to specific morphogenetic cell behaviors during gastrulation.<br/><br/>Specific Aim 2 examines the PMC GRN as it is deployed during regulative development. Using molecular probes and morpholinos, he will analyze the 1) expression, 2) function, and 3) regulatory interactions of the known upstream components of the PMC GRN under several different experimental scenarios that induce ectopic activation of the GRN. <br/><br/>The broader impact of the proposed research is derived from the training of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows.

Identification of molecules and mechanisms  involved in pattern formation have been the central interest  of developmental biologists. Dr. Chuong is using feather  morphogenesis as a model to study pattern formation and has  focused on adhesion molecules and homeobox (Hox) genes. Dr.  Chuong has shown that there are two kinds of Hox gradients  in the integument: a ""macro gradient"" across the feather  tract and a ""micro gradient"" across a single feather bud.  The asynchronous alignment of different Hox macro gradient  leads to a unique repertoire of position specific Hox  expression patterns named Hox codes of skin appendages,  which he hypothesizes determine the phenotype of skin  appendages. Retinoic acid (RA) can transform feather  phenotypes and alter the anterior-posterior axis of skin  appendages, with concomitant changes in Hox expression.  Epithelial-mesenchymal  recombination revealed that the Hox  micro gradient may be regulated by a signal from the  epithelium. By the use of  RA responsive element-LacZ-  containing F9 cells it has been shown that a wave of  endogenous RA activity propagates bilaterally from the  midline. Dr. Chuong now suggests that 1) Hox codes of skin  appendages determine the phenotype of skin appendages while  the micro gradient determines the A-P axis of skin  appendages, 2) The two gradients are regulated  independently: the macro gradient may originate from the  mesoderm, but the micro gradient is determined later and may  be determined by the epithelium, and 3) RA is an endogenous  morphogen in skin morphogenesis, with a dynamic distribution  pattern during feather development similar to that of  morphogenetic furrow in Drosophila eye development. To test  these hypotheses, Dr. Chuong will ectopically express Hox  genes on skin appendages in ovo using retroviral gene  delivery. The ontogeny of Hox codes will be traced back to  dermatome stage using DiI tracing and somite transpos ition.  To search for the signals that regulate Hox gene expression,  a model using epithelial-mesenchymal rotation/recombination  of skin explants was developed in which the inducing signal  can be analyzed. To test whether endogenous RA is involved  in pattern formation, RARE-LacZ containing cell monolayers  will be used to detect the dynamic RA distribution in  developing skin. Aided by the distinct morphology of  feathers, these novel approaches will add new dimensions to  our understanding of pattern formation.  ***"

The two PIs on this collaborative project, Stuart Newman  (New York Medical College) and Gabor Forgacs (Clarkson University)  propose to continue a program of interdisciplinary studies on the  idea that 'generic' physical properties of tissue, such as surface  tension, interfacial tension, and viscosity contribute importantly  to the tissue's morphogenetic behaviors.

One approach has been the use of genetic manipulation to alter cell regulatory processes.  The research objective of this project is to utilize RNA interference to engineer mechanotransduction processes for the purposes of enhancing efforts in cell-based therapies, such as tissue engineering.  Such applications often involve spatially heterogeneous cells and matrix, and sites that possess an adverse mechanical environment.  The incorporation of intrinsic control over cellular mechanobiologic function, in addition to current strategies, may enhance the performance of cellular constructs.  This project investigates the modification of mechanotransduction at different levels.  Pericellular regulation will be studied by individually silencing types II and VI collagen and small leucine-rich proteoglycans, decorin and biglycan, and assessing their contributions to cell mechanics and mechanobiologic response.  Altering transmembrane and intracellular mechanosignaling will be investigated through interference of stretch activated channel KCNK2, actin bridging protein -actinin, and G-protein signaling molecules RhoA and Rock1.  The impact of using engineered cells for generating stratified tissue constructs will be determined by fabricating dual population hydrogels that are maintained in long-term co-culture and co-stimulation.<br/><br/>The educational objectives that are integrated with cellular engineering include the introduction of new classroom and research opportunities at both undergraduate and graduate levels.  Students will learn how cellular engineering can serve as a tool in bioengineering and as a novel approach in biomechanics.  More broadly relevant educational objectives are to generate greater awareness of the bioengineering field, and to provide current bioengineers with a competitive advantage in the job market.  To promote awareness, the PI plans to expand his current outreach program, which involves both giving demonstrations at high schools and bringing high school student groups to the University of Maryland.  To enhance bioengineering design experience, a pilot program will be tested wherein multidisciplinary teams of engineers will be formed.  This will allow bioengineering students to leverage their cross-disciplinary skills, and provide opportunities for other engineering students to learn how their skills can be applied to bio-related designs.  <br/><br/>"

Mimicking the structure and function of natural tissue requires coordination of signals from many cell types. How these signals interact to direct development of complex tissues is not well understood, and effective predictive tools are lacking. The goal of this project is to monitor, model, and modulate the differentiation of stem cells to produce tissues. This project will provide a clearer picture of dynamic tissue development and new tools to predict and manipulate stem cell fate. This will lead to a strategy for engineering of accurate and reproducible tissues, leading to improved tissue engineered therapies and better models for drug development. This project will involve undergraduate research experiences, a capstone design component, a student summer internship program, and an industry immersion program for graduate students. <br/><br/>This RECODE project will apply a systems reverse engineering of stochasticity (SRES) approach to monitor, model, and modulate heterotypic co-differentiation of progenitor cells in 3D organoids. SRES will advance the science which underlies the co-differentiation of cells in complex tissues. Crucial to this project is the development of nanoscale biosensors providing dynamic multigene expression analysis in single cells within complex heterotypic organoids. Spatiotemporal differentiation marker expression, combined with proliferation measures in sorted populations will be monitored. The data will be used to develop stochastic agent-based models of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) function and differentiation. The models will predict the relative proportions of osteogenic, endotheliogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages based on multiplexed stimuli, and be updatable using real-time biosensor data. The predictive models will be tested by modulating heterotypic differentiation trajectories with temporally controlled siRNA differentiation factors to create heterotypic bone and cartilage organoids. This new knowledge will provide a systematic means for engineering heterotypic 3D tissue models necessary for realizing intricate skeletal architectures. The technical goals of the project are to: (i) develop new multiplex real-time intracellular reporters for differentiation markers, (ii) develop stochastic models of progenitor cell proliferation and fate based on dynamic differentiation marker expression and (iii) validate the agent-based stochastic models of organoid development using siRNA targeting pathways known to de novo regulate differentiation.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Engineering Biology and Health Cluster in ENG/CBET and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Cluster in BIO/MCB.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to translate these technologies as therapeutics it is necessary to understand cell behavior within the 3D environment. An ongoing FDA-University of Maryland (UMD) collaboration has led to the development and characterization of a cell adhesion centrifugation (CAC) assay to enhance isolation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow. This proposal will enhance the utility of the established assay for use with 3D constructs. It will also provide useful insight into cell-scaffold interaction in three dimensions that will inform standardization criteria.  The work will partner researchers, faculty and students at the University of Maryland and the FDA.<br/><br/>The development of the CAC assay to accommodate 3D scaffold designs has the potential to minimize the translational distance for TE therapies by providing a mechanism to characterize and purify cells within 3D constructs. The cellular capture device will stabilize 3D scaffolds and allow characterization of non-adherent cells based on integrin-ligand binding. The key aims are: 1) investigate MSC behavior and purification from bone marrow seeded onto 3D constructs through adaptation of the CAC assay wherein the impact of centrifugation force, incubation time, and 3D construct architecture will be evaluated: 2) investigate the interaction of MSCs with 3D ECM-polymer scaffolds through examination of multi-lineage differentiation potential enabled by ECM additives to 3DP scaffold adhesion and differentiation capacity: and 3)investigate the capture and characterization of non-adhered cells collected using the CAC assays. This will allow the FDA to further develop the CAC assay and to evaluate its utility as a method to characterize the cellular component 3D construct based therapies."

Despite numerous clinical trials and growing industry commitment, no concerted effort has been made to enable scalable manufacturing of therapeutic cells as an effective, safe, reproducible, and affordable product with standardized characterization, and quality control. This has hindered broad translation of cell therapies into clinical and industrial practice. To overcome this, the engineering community must develop new tools and technologies to reproducibly manufacture high-quality cells at large-scale and low-cost; enable robust supply-chain, storage, and distribution logistics; and train a diverse cell-manufacturing workforce. The proposed ERC for Cell Manufacturing Technologies (CMaT) is a national, comprehensive, convergence-science effort where engineers will work closely with industry partners, clinicians, biologists, workforce experts, as well as standards and regulatory agencies to transform the production of therapeutic cells into a large-scale, low-cost, reproducible, and high-quality engineered manufacturing process. Georgia Tech is the lead university of CMaT. The University of Georgia, University of Wisconsin ? Madison, and University of Puerto Rico ? Mayaguez are major partners, alongside several affiliate institutions. CMaT will have broad and lasting societal impact: producing new fundamental knowledge and transformative technologies, building an inclusive workforce, nurturing a nascent industry, and improving healthcare. It will be an internationally recognized exemplar center with state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, an embedded culture of innovation and inclusion, and will engage deeply and broadly in education and workforce development through a comprehensive program involving under-represented students and teachers from high schools, students with disabilities, veterans, technical and community college students, as well as undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The CMaT team recently led the development of an industry-driven, 10-year national roadmap for cell manufacturing that provides a prioritized pathway for critical technology development. CMaT will be a natural venue for implementing this roadmap. Scalable manufacturing of high-quality therapeutic cells poses complex challenges, different from those currently experienced by industry. First, the product is a ""living"" entity whose properties can change with every manipulation requiring a whole new paradigm for large-scale manufacturing and quality-control. Second, little is known about the Critical Quality Attributes (CQA) of therapeutic cells, i.e. measurable biomarkers that render them safe and effective for specific disease indications in patients and how to measure them. Third, little standardization exists across the field. Thus, Quality-by-Design (QbD), a fundamental premise of current manufacturing practice, has not been implemented in cell manufacturing. To enable these, CMaT will innovate transformative tools, technologies, and methods using three Engineered Systems (Test-Beds): (a) Mesenchymal Stem/stromal Cells for immune-modulation and musculoskeletal regeneration, (b) T cell immunotherapies for cancer, and (c) induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived cardiac cells to treat heart diseases. In each of these systems CMaT will develop (a) new omics-based tools that couple big-data analytics and modeling to identify CQAs for safety and efficacy prediction; (b) novel cell-process sensors to measure quality attributes, both at the initial starting point and throughout the manufacturing process, and ensure well-defined, reproducible and high quality cells for therapy; (c) new scale-up and scale-out technologies with integrated quality control; (d) efficient cell purification and separation technologies that maintain cell purity, yield, and quality; (e) high throughput methods for rapidly validating function, potency and safety of manufactured cells; and (f) critical industrial-design principles, automated closed-system manufacturing, and supply-chain modeling to lower cost, ensure reproducibility, and enable scalable production."

A major gap in deploying this technology is defining optimal assembly and storage conditions, such that the cellular device can be inventoried and made ready for immediate deployment in hospital ICUs for this critically ill patient population. Our objective in this project is to scale up our prototype device, and to determine optimal biopreservation methods to achieve an off-the-shelf product for on-demand use in hospital ICUs.<br/><br/>The broader commercial impact of this research will allow for extended storage of our device, removing the need for an ?assemble-and-ship-on-demand? distribution model. This will reduce costs and remove lead-time requirements for ordering, assembling, and shipping a product. Customers would have the devices on-site, ready for use. This would be a breakthrough for cellular devices and would lay the groundwork for extending this platform technology into other acute organ failure indications. The broader impacts of this effort include reducing the high mortality rate (>70%) and morbidity for these patients, many of whom progress to long-term renal disease. Significant cost savings to the health care system of up to $4B per year are also anticipated from reduced patient time in ICU, reduced time to hospital discharge, and fewer patients requiring long-term dialysis."

The damage attributed to cartilage over time presents a tremendous challenge for millions of Americans, and ultimately fosters the development of osteoarthritis. Given this important need to mitigate the damage to cartilage, it is critical that new therapeutic implantable materials are developed for human joints. In order to discover, understand, and ultimately utilize new biomaterial, fundamental knowledge of the behavior of these materials in a complex mechanical stress and biological environment is required. This award will support graduate and undergraduate training on the preparation and evaluation of new therapeutic materials for cartilage tissue repair and will further our understanding of how they respond under stressed environments that lead to osteoarthritis. Additionally, students at Morehouse College will prepare short films to engage society into learning about biomaterial science while also hosting outreach activities for local Atlanta Public School students.

However, articular cartilage is limited in its ability to repair itself after defects from disease or injury. At the onset of injury or disease, hypoxia  (low oxygen) disrupt the avascular architecture giving rise to the presence of reactive oxygen species that prevent healthy articular cartilage cell proliferation throughout the three-dimensional cartilage tissue matrix. Biomaterials that promote healthy 3D cell culture and proliferation under hypoxia are currently not available. The objective of this project focuses on the development of thermo-sensitive therapeutic laden hydrogels and the study of hypoxia on cell viability and hydrogel structure and function prepared from 3D printed bio-inks. This research entails the preparation, characterization, 3D printing, biochemical analysis, and spatial mapping of thermo-responsive therapeutic laden hydrogels that provide a new approach to regenerative tissue engineering. The use of hybrid therapeutic hydrogels to improve cell microenvironments and promote healthy extracellular matrix in 3D culture is of particular interest. The governing hypothesis of this project is driven by formulations of hybrid therapeutic laden hydrogels with robust structural integrity, higher oxygen diffusion coefficients, and the structural mimicry of articular cartilage zones via 3D printed bio-inks to provide cellular-protection under hypoxia towards chondrogenesis. Using hybrid therapeutic laden hydrogels, the Principal Investigator and research team evaluate how hypoxic induced reactive oxygen species mitigate cell fate, ECM amounts, and effect biomaterial properties. The effect of chemical modifications and the impact of structure and function in hybrid therapeutic hydrogels are noted for improved tissue engineering strategies.  The research team approaches include using chemical and polymer synthesis of preparation of hybrid therapeutic hydrogels, material characterization, 3D-printing using flow-based direct ink write, static cell culture of articular chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells under hypoxia and normoxia, and mechanical stimulation regimes to assess chemical structure phase changes, along with temporal and  spatial localization of extra cellular matrix proteins. Finally, new knowledge will be gained from this research by contributions to the development of novel therapeutic hydrogels for cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration by improving biomaterial properties to endure under pathophysiological conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aptamers can be developed for an extremely broad spectrum of targets, such as small molecules, proteins, cells, viruses, and bacteria, with well controlled target selectivity and predefined binding characteristics. In particular, aptamer binding in general exhibits strong temperature dependence; thus, aptamers may specifically bind target analytes at a predefined temperature and reversibly decouple from the targets at a modestly different, yet also predefined, temperature. This property is attractive to affinity purification, as it can enable specific purification with thermally activated release and isocratic elution of analytes, as well as regeneration of the purification instrument. Additionally, thermally activated isocratic elution frees experimental procedures from unnecessary and potentially harmful reagents, and simplifies the purification procedure. Conventional SELEX instruments are widely used but are generally labor-intensive and time-consuming. These limitations can be addressed by leveraging microfluidic technology. We propose to develop a microfluidic SELEX system that integrates all steps of the SELEX method to allow automated development of aptamers with predefined temperature-dependent binding characteristics for applications to affinity purification of analytes. Our specific aims include: (1) developing a bead-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in a microchannel to establish its applicability to microfluidic SELEX; (2) integrating microchip DNA selection and amplification processes to create a prototype microfluidic SELEX system; and (3) validating the prototype system and demonstrating its utility with selection of aptamers targeting proteins which are involved in cancer detection and therapy, and for which established aptamers are available.<br/><br/>The proposed research will have broader impacts in healthcare and biotechnology. Applied to therapeutics, aptamers can be tuned to target and inhibit particular proteins which are the cause of diseases. Given their selectivity, drug delivery mechanisms can be devised where aptamer molecules for a specific disease initiated protein are released into the system for location and suppression of the protein. Alternatively, aptamers can also be used to screen potential drug candidates. Aptamers specific to the prospective drug can be used to immobilize the molecule to undergo extensive characterization. Moreover, the proposed research has potential in diagnosis and biosensing for environmental and food monitoring, antiterrorism, and pathology. Aptamers can be selected for toxins, pathogens and parasites which can contaminate air, water and food supplies. Also, aptamers are of utility in cell manipulation. Cell separation with thermally sensitive aptamers offers attractive alternatives to current techniques in cell counting. In particular, cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells, can benefit from specific extraction, enrichment and isocratic elution using aptamers. Finally, a strong educational component in this research will involve undergraduate- and graduate-level teaching, interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students including those from minorities and underrepresented groups, and active educational outreach activities in New York City."

To become motile, cells must undergo radical changes in their composition and behavior, the so-called epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT).  These radical changes arise as the network of genes controlling the state of the cell transitions from one type of stable fate to another. This project details a joint theory-experiment physics-biology effort to study how EMT is coordinated in space and time by chemical signals passed among the tumor cells.  The specific focus here is on the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway has been studied extensively for its role in developmental biology and has been implicated indirectly in cancer, but has never been studied systematically in this context. The hypothesis to be investigated is that this pathway can allow the formation of small clusters of cells that have undergone EMT together, and which thereafter travel as a collective en route to the establishment of a secondary tumor. If proven to be true, these ideas will shed light on the fundamental origins of metastasis and might in the future offer new strategies for both prognosis and treatment.<br/> <br/>Cell-cell interactions, both between tumor cells proper and between tumor and stromal cells, are known to be a key component of many solid tumors. The investigators will focus on how one of these interactions, that mediated by the Notch pathway, can coordinate cell phenotypes and can thereby control tumor progression. To accomplish this will require the use and extension of sophisticated theory techniques from the field of non-equilibrium pattern formation coupled to an experimental plan focused on pancreatic cancer cell lines to be studied in both 2d and 3d in vitro conditions, both without and with supporting cancer-associated fibroblasts. Of particular importance will be measuring spatial correlations of EMT state (and other known correlates) and comparing these to expectations based on different signaling assumptions. Iterating these experiments with increasingly realistic model-building and model-solving will allow for the creation of a quantitatively reliable picture for the collective behavior of the tumor, going well-beyond current individual cell approaches.<br/><br/>This project is cofunded by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division at NSF."

Age and reduced physical activity disrupt mechanical signaling and diminish the potency of stem cells within the bone marrow that replenish bone-building cells. Even though poor skeletal health is a major cause of injury and disability among aged individuals, the reason for reduced bone-building responsiveness to exercise in older individuals, compared to younger individuals, remains a knowledge gap. This project will quantify the mechanical forces that cells are subjected to in bone by using novel 3D printed tissue engineering constructs. Combining this technology with the aging conditions caused by microgravity in experiments to be conducted on the International Space Station will reveal the putative connections between aging and physical activity at the cellular level. Ultimately, these efforts may lead to non-pharmacologic, regenerative strategies to improve muscle and bone health in in older adults, in those who must undergo extended bedrest, and astronauts. The multidisciplinary approach taken in this bioengineering project will be an excellent platform to fascinate and engage the next generation of students and young scientists.<br/><br/>A major technical barrier in studying the mechanical environment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that reside within bone marrow is that there are no model systems currently available that can replicate the mechanical complexity of the bone marrow compartment. To close this gap, this work will develop a 3D printed bone marrow analog system that combines an in vivo environment with the accessibility of an in vitro culture system. This will permit a systematic approach of study. To study cellular mechanical environments within these marrow analogs, the approach will include an experimental setup and a complementary and validated finite element model. These mechanoactive marrow environments will provide a novel tool for mechanobiologists to systematically study the effect of the mechanical environment on cell responses in 3D. Utilization of this novel system in this project will specifically advance mechanobiology knowledge by: (1) quantifying the mechanoresponse of old MSCs in a young bone marrow geometry and vice versa, thereby identifying the contribution of mechanical stress environment to the mechanosignaling capacity of aged MSCs. (2) establishing, for the first time, how the mechanical stress environment contributes to microgravity-simulated aging of MSCs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The biodegradable aspect of PHAs leads toward environmentally sustainable applications, such as biodegradable shopping bags, whereas the biocompatibility of PHAs allows for the pursuit of medical applications such as wound dressings and tissue scaffolds. In collaboration with Dr. Keiji Numata, a leading expert in biopolymers at the RIKEN institute in Japan, this study aims to develop cutting edge PHA plastics with enhanced physical properties. This research will result in a novel PHA with a high degree of cross-linking, which is hypothesized to increase flexibility in stiff and brittle PHAs, and incorporate shape-memory features into soft and elastic PHAs. Stronger and flexible PHAs may find uses as bone scaffolds to promote rapid healing, or as stents for patients suffering from collapsed arteries. Softer PHAs could be used as artificial tissue, such as heart valves or nerve grafts for repairing damaged neurons.  <br/><br/>To achieve this goal, unsaturated PHAs will be chemically modified by thiolene click chemistry. Using a polythiol linker, the PHA side-chain alkene functional groups will be cross-linked using UV light. It is anticipated that controlling the extent of the modification will result in plastics with tailorable physical properties, tunable as required for specific applications. In addition to physical properties, PHAs will be tested for biocompatibility to ensure they maintain relevant for medical uses.

In this project, the investigators propose identification and characterization of factors derived from stem cells towards regenerating and repairing elastic fiber assembly and structure. Further, the studies aim to deliver factors in a sustained manner using degradable polymeric particles which are themselves chemically modified to stimulate new elastic fiber formation and prevent its breakdown. The investigators will then test the effectiveness of the particles in treating abdominal aortic aneurysms, a disorder characterized by breakdown of the structure of the major elastic blood vessel (aorta). In the future, this platform technology can be extended to treat other non-vascular elastic tissue types (e.g., lung tissue) in need of structural repair. <br/><br/>This proposal aims to develop innovative, new approaches to enable in situ, biomimetic elastic matrix regenerative repair in soft, elastic tissues structurally compromised by proteolytic injury. The proposed approach seeks to overcome intrinsically-poor auto-regenerative repair of disrupted elastic matrix by stable adult cell types. The investigators have recently shown bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC)-derived smooth muscle cells (BM-SMCs), but not undifferentiated BM-MSCs, to be significantly more elastogenic than adult vascular SMCs (healthy, diseased), and their secretions to stimulate elastic matrix regenerative repair by SMCs of a diseased, matrix assembly-impaired phenotype. As physical delivery of stem cells faces several challenges, this project proposes to design and test a stem cell-inspired, but cell-free regenerative approach to in situ ECM regenerative repair. The approach is based on sustained, local delivery of BM-SMC secretome components identified to be necessary and sufficient for pro-elastin regenerative stimulus from novel polymer nanocarriers that themselves exhibit pro-elastogenic and anti-proteolytic properties. Through experiments designed to address three specific aims, the investigators will test hypotheses that a) human BM-MSCs (hBM-MSCs) can be efficiently differentiated into SMCs (hBM-SMCs) exhibiting distinct, elastogenicity-determining phenotypic states; b) pro-elastogenic effects of hBM-SMCs on abdominal aortic aneurysm SMCs are mediated by their secreted trophic factors (secretome); c) key components of hBM-SMC secretome individually or in combination are necessary and sufficient for pro-elastogenic and anti-proteolytic effect; and d) integrating sustained delivery of key hBM-SMC secretome factor(s) with nanocarriers will augment quantity & quality of regenerative elastic matrix repair in an ECM-disrupted, 3-D tissue space. The broad research impact of this project is based on its potential that a novel nanotherapeutic approach may enable regenerative elastic matrix repair that recapitulates regenerative effects of SC secretions. Through this project, the investigators will a) develop educational modules for students at several educational levels to better understand stem cell- and tissue engineering, and b) provide unique inter-institutional collaborative training opportunities for students at Cleveland Clinic and Virginia Commonwealth University. By working through well-established summer internship and outreach programs at these institutions, the investigators will develop educational modules that will benefit high school students, undergraduate students and the general public.

The generation of two identical daughter cells requires not only that each cell receives an equal complement of  genetic material (DNA) but also that the other contents of the cell be divided equally. The process of physically separating the two daughter cells is known as cytokinesis, and this process involves a contractile ring that physically constricts the cell and splits it in two. Cytokinesis utilizes many of the same same mechanisms that are used to regulate cell shape change during migration. Cell shape is dependent on a dynamic structure (the cytoskeleton) that is comprised primarily of the protein actin, and whose behavior is regulated by a number of small signaling molecules. Several conflicting models have been proposed to explain how these small molecules interact to control the cytoskeleton, but the explanatory power of these models has not been clearly established. This project will investigate the regulation of the cytoskeleton by these small  signaling molecules and help to clarify the mechanisms by which they function.This research will provide training and educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, with a concerted effort to recruit underrepresented minorities including Native American Indian and  Hispanic students. Outreach into high schools will also be performed with the intent to generate in students a long-term interest in science. <br/><br/>In this project, a toolbox of molecular and pharmacological reagents will be combined with biophysical measurements and high-resolution light and electron microscopy to examine how the G proteins Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 coordinate cytokinesis-related shape change in large embryonic cells.

Abundant evidence now exists which indicates  that the major pattern forming mechanisms were in place  prior to the protostome-deuterostome radiation. Ctenophores  undergo a highly stereotyped mode of development in which  the normal fate of individual blastomeres can be precisely  predicted. Adult structures derived from deleted blasotmeres  are not replaced by surviving blastomeres during subsequent  embryogenesis. Adult ctenophores on the other hand are  capable of regenerating vast regions of their body,  including all pattern elements and cell types. Dr.  Martindale's prior work has shown that ctenophore embryos  are not mosaics of individual parts but that they have  ""organizing centers"" analogous in their function to the  dorsal lip in vertebrate embryos and the D quadrant in  spiralian embryos. The deletion of this organizing center in  ctenophore embryos results in abnormal development of  several different structures to which these deleted cells  themselves make no direct contribution. This implies that,  as in adult regeneration, the embryo requires intercellular  signaling. The experiments proposed here will advance our  understanding of the mechanistic basis of  this pattern  regulation both in the ctenophore embryo and adult. The  specific aims are: 1) To generate an accurate fate map of  the ctenophore embryo to identify the origins of all known  cell types, with special reference to the origins of nerve  cells, mesenchymal cells, muscle cells, components of  tentacle sheathes, and the pluripotent stem cells involved  in adult regenerative ability, 2) to identify the spatial  and temporal characteristics of inductive interactions which  operate to establish global symmetry properties and cell  type determination in the ctenophore embryo, 3) To finish a  systematic study of the r ole of  individual cell types on  the ability of ctenophores to regenerate, and 4) To  determine the role of cell division in the ability to  regenerate adult pattern elements.

This technique could revolutionize medicine by enabling a patient's own cells to be reverted back and modified to correct mutations and regenerate injured tissues; however, the process in which cells reprogram is not well defined or understood, is very inefficient and takes considerable time. In this CAREER proposal, designer cell culture materials will be used to study how cells revert to pluripotency in order to develop a system that can quickly and efficiently reprogram a patients cells. The combination of approaches employed is expected to dramatically reduce reprogramming time, increase efficiency, and reduce the need for exogenous factors (e.g. lentivirus), which will prove transformative to commercial and clinical ventures that need to reproducibly generate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for regenerative therapies. The emerging view of how materials influence cellular reprogramming that is supported by this research will be integrated into education and outreach activities by establishing a Stem Cell Engineering Training Institute (SCETI). In this institute, laboratory videos with senior undergraduates, and high school educators will be developed for use in an annual summer camp for high school girls - Girls Adventures in Mathematics Engineering and Science (GAMES) - and to augment the curriculum of a senior undergraduate course: Design and Use of Biomaterials. <br/><br/>Most somatic cell reprogramming methods are performed on rigid plastic which leads to heterogeneity in cellular organization and proliferation. These conditions foster a slow stochastic process with rare reprogramming events initiated by a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). The process of MET in vivo is regulated by microenvironments with defined biochemical and biophysical properties. Motivated by natural MET processes that occur during development, and the architecture of the early embryo where pluripotency is first established, the proposed work aims to control matrix composition, substrate mechanics and tissue geometry on the cell culture substrate,to more closely recapitulate in vivo architectures and to promote MET and accelerate somatic cell reprogramming. The success of this work will provide mechanistic insight into the de-differentiation process and yield a suite of commercially viable cell culture materials and reagents for somatic cell reprogramming.

The team will test this hypothesis by conducting studies that aim (1) to determine correlations between cellular mechanical properties and the CD44+/CD24- breast cancer stem cell phenotype, and (2) to identify regulatory crosstalk between cellular mechanical properties and the CD44+/CD24- breast cancer stem cell phenotype.  <br/>Intellectual Merit:   This research seeks to address complex issues at the interface of the physical sciences and oncology.  Therefore, principles and techniques from chemical engineering, biophysics, and medical sciences will be employed to achieve the study goals.

This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports fundamental research on a new biomanufacturing method that simultaneously offers the speed, the resolution, and the ability to process multiple biomaterials and cells to 3D print biomimetic vascular network. Results from this research will potentially transform the biomanufacturing field for future tissue and organ printing with biomimetic vascular network.

Additionally, the biomimetic in vitro tissue models could significantly benefit the pharmatheutical industry because they can be used in early drug screening for drug toxicity and efficacy testing.<br/><br/>The new biomanufacturing method features ultraviolet light-induced hydrogel formation in a scanningless and continuous fashion for rapid 3D printing of biomimetic vascular network. The first research objective is to understand the effects of material composition and processing parameters on mechanical properties of the hydrogel scaffolds for the 3D printing process. To achieve this objective, glycidal methacrylate-hyaluronic acid and gelatin methacrylate will be synthesized as the hydrogel materials with different methacrylation ratios. Hydrogel scaffolds will be printed by varying material composition (such as molecular weight and concentration of the monomers) and processing parameters (such as ultraviolet light intensity and exposure time). Mechanical properties (such as stiffness and yield strength) of printed hydrogel scaffolds will be measured by a nanoindentor and dynamic mechanical analyzer. The second objective is to understand how scaffold shape and chemistry affect vascular network formation. To achieve this objective, scaffolds of different shapes including single tubes and branched tubes will be printed using different hydrogels (glycidal methacrylate-hyaluronic acid and gelatin methacrylate).

However, despite recent advances in 3D printing of non-biological materials, 3D printing of living cells remains a challenge. One of the key challenges is the lack of bioinks with 3D printability and biocompatibility. This award supports fundamental research on nanocomposite hydrogel bioinks that encapsulate living cells in 3D printing process. Results from this research will enable not only the rational design of cell-encapsulating bioinks with 3D printability and biocompatibility, but also the high resolution 3D printing of tissue structures. This research potentially benefits many areas in biomedicine, including the development of tissue and organ models, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine.<br/><br/>The research objectives of this project are (1) to understand the effects of compositions of cell-laden nanocomposite bioinks on their dynamic mechanical properties (shear-thinning and self-healing properties) and cell viability; and (2) to establish the relationship between the dynamic mechanical properties of cell-laden nanocomposite bioinks and their 3D printability and cell-compatibility (cell viability in printed tissues).  To achieve the first objective, gel-phase nanocomposite bioinks that consist of surface-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes, gelatin methacrylate (hydrogel matrix), and living cells will be synthesized.  The concentration of nanotubes and gelatin methacrylate will be varied from 0 to 10% with the total solid fraction of less than 10%.  Fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (10^6 to 10^8 cells/mL) will be used as model cells.  The storage and loss shear moduli of these gel-phase bioinks will be measured with oscillatory strain sweeps and strain steps (thixotropy) using a rheometer to determine the shear-thinning and self-healing properties.  The viability of cells encapsulated in bioinks will be measured (hourly and daily up to 7 days).  To achieve the second objective, multilayer 3D tissue structures will be printed with 100 and 200 micron nozzles.  The 3D printability of gel-phase bioinks will be determined by characterizing printed structures (shape definition and structural integrity) using optical microscopy.  Bioinks that produce self-supporting 3D structures with a filament diameter of less than 200 microns will be defined as 3D printable.

In this project, a biomimetic scaffold will be created by combining a gelatinous material exhibiting desired spatial gradients with synthetic fibers displaying biochemical signals in a repetitive fashion. The individual components and the integrated scaffold will be produced using a novel process that takes advantage of an ultrafast, highly efficient coupling reaction. Such a process permits the spatial control of scaffold properties without having to rely on external, potentially toxic triggers or templates, thereby enabling facile incorporation of the patient's cells in the scaffold in 3D.

However, the mechanisms regulating osteointegration of CaPs have yet to be understood.  Progress has stalled because of a lack of appropriate tools and methodologies that can isolate key regulators as well as combine them in a controlled and systematic way.  Three factors stand out as particularly important for the CaP system: microporosity, BMP-2, and biologic apatite.  The potential dominating mechanisms relating to osteointegration are hypothesized to be sequestration of BMP-2 and enhanced formation of biologic apatite in the presence of micropores.  The goal is to quantify the relative importance of and potential interactions between these factors at different stages of bone formation and to understand the mechanisms behind their influence, using CaPs as a biomaterial platform and a unique set of tools.  CaPs with macro (>100um) and microporosity (<50um) have greatly enhanced osteointegration as compared to those with only macroporosity.  While microporosity has been used primarily to enhance growth into macropores, there is now evidence that microporosity is also a space for bone and its inclusion in CaP scaffolds can result in multiscale ostointegration (MSO)- bone growth throughout both macro and micropores.  This has not been achieved with any other system.  The unique suite of tools will be used to examine the role of key regulators, microporosity, BMP-2, and bioapatite, and the mechanisms behind their influence on osteointegration.  The tools allow for (1) control of microporosity, which uniquely enables systematic exploration of microporosity and related characteristics, (2) attaching BMP-2 to CaPs with varying levels of affinity, which provides the unique opportunity to study the effects of both sequestered and releasing BMP-2, and (3) the capability to grow biological apatite on the surface of CaPs, which enables investigation of the influence of biological apatite on cell response.  Further, each of these parameters can be independently controlled.  The specific objectives are:  (1) Determine the minimum pore size through which cells will migrate given a potent chemotactic and osteoinductive stimulus, BMP-2.  This is critical for establishing bounds on pore characteristics for MSO.  (2) Determine the influence of the stimuli in attracting mesenchymal stem cells to the substrate.  (3) Determine the influence of the stimuli in matrix production and mineralization.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  Taken together, the systematic approach used here to combine the factors described and the proposed analysis will provide new insight into the rational design of biomaterials that interface with bone.  The potential advances will lead to new understanding of bone/material interactions, could have huge benefit for those affected by bone loss or joint failure (e.g. coated implants), and could relieve some of the economic burden associated with these procedures.  The main educational activities are related to developing an instructional module that uses an inquiry-based approach and engages science teachers at the Campus Middle School for Girls (CMSG, Urbana, IL) in research activities.  The objective in working with CMSG is to positively influence girls' perceptions of STEM, which may lead to their persistence in the field.  The work with CMSG is in partnership with an existing NSF NSEC, and the learning module will become part of the existing educational programs in the NSF Center for use in programs that target underrepresented groups."

Control of cell behavior is traditionally accomplished using chemical methods; and these methods are inherently useful, but difficulties with cell stability do arise. Currently, cells are grown on tissue culture treated Petri dishes (made from polystyrene or glass).  These products, while inexpensive and readily available, can produce undesirable effects on adherent cells. Effects such as premature differentiation and/or aging phenomenon in cells may limit the potential of these cells to be used in future cell therapeutics. This I-Corps team has developed nano-structured multi-well plate inserts for cell culture.  These nano-structured substrates, produced using injection molding techniques allow for robust culture of stem cells (both human mesenchymal and other subtypes) in the absence of further chemical treatments, such as oxygen plasma, protein coatings, or other surface modifications; potentially reducing the cost of laboratory cell culture protocols.  Through manufacturing, modulation of the nano-structured surface features (llows for either long-term culture of stem cells or controlled differentiation of the cells. The wide variety of cell-substrata interactions made possible as a result would enable a whole new paradigm for stem cell development and differentiation, and allow this science to possibly translate at a faster rate to clinical applications.<br/><br/>Biological cells exert mechanical forces in both the horizontal and vertical directions. In general, however, the vertical forces are small compared to horizontal cellular forces (traction forces). Thus, the key to affecting cells via these dominant traction forces is to control substrate compliance in the lateral direction (flexural stiffness). Considering the substrate to be rigid, Hooke's law of elastic deformation can be applied, which for cylindrical columns at the micro- or nano-scale yields a predictable in-plane force-displacement relationship.  With precise determination of surface feature dimensions and spacing, micro/nanostructured surface arrays can be designed to yield a range of effective lateral surface compliances. As feature deformation is dictated by the applied force, a finer pitch will position more features under each cell and produce a reduction of the biological traction forces applied to each one. To manufacture these features, the team has taken advantage of injection molding as a high volume and repeatable method to create surface areas conducive to eliciting specific cellular functions. Ultraviolet lithography, combined with deep reactive ion etching, is used to generate micro-features over a relatively large surface area of a silicon wafer. The micro-featured silicon wafer is then used as a mold insert for the micro-injection molding process to create surfaces from a wide variety of thermoplastic polymers. Altering the mold features controls the micro-geometry, which further alters the effective surface stiffness of the polymer substrate and the resultant behavior of the cells - leading to advanced cellular engineering opportunities."

Furthermore, using a mesenchymal stem cell micromass culture as a testbed, this work will define tangible criteria for building biomaterials that can promote stem cell differentiation in response to exogenous soluble cues while providing early information about the role of GAGs (and their sulfation level) in cartilage development. Additionally, because GAGs are implicated in such a wide range of biological processes, the materials developed here can be used to elucidate the role of GAGs in development, cancer, and immunity (to name a few examples), therefore contributing significantly to advancing basic biological knowledge in these fields as well. Further broader impacts include the creation of a highly interdisciplinary environment in which to train graduate and undergraduate biologists, engineers and chemists to address critical questions in creating the next generation of tailorable biomaterials by integrating knowledge from materials science, chemistry, biology and medicine.<br/><br/>Biomaterials derived from tissues, such as those examined in this project, are advantageous because they often possess specific capabilities to interact with their environment and direct healing.

The workshop will also show that chemistry is a diverse subject that is much broader in scope than what would typically be taught in high school. In concert, a chemical biology course targeting upper level undergraduate and graduate students will be developed to demonstrate how chemical methods are used to understand fundamental aspects of biological systems. The course will include protein chemistry, especially post-translational modifications as well as a survey of cutting edge discoveries, intended to show students that chemists can make important contributions at the cutting-edge of biological science. Students participating in the Initiative for Minority Student Development (IMSD)-Bioscience Initiative program at the University of Kansas will be encouraged to enroll in this course. The principal investigator will actively recruit minority undergraduate students through this program into her laboratory to help them in pursuing graduate studies and a research career in the field of chemical biology."

The I-Corps team is developing an electroactive scaffold that mimics both structural and electrical properties of the native extracellular matrix present during early cartilage development to repair articular cartilage defects. This biomaterial represents a different, cost-effective and simple approach to tapping into a biological mechanism for repairing damaged articular cartilage. The joint environment appears to be rich in mesenchymal progenitor cells, which have been isolated from the bone marrow, periosteum, synovial membrane and fluid, and from the articular cartilage itself. A regenerative approach for joint tissue repair could be the recruitment of resident endogenous stem cells to the site of damage and activation of the repair process. The electroactive scaffold is a synthetic material, piezoelectric polyvinylidine fluoride copolymer (FDA-approved material for suture applications), that is processed into a fibrous form. Fibrous scaffolds have a beneficial structural feature for cell adhesion and growth due to their large surface-to-volume and high aspect ratios resulting from the smallness of the diameter. The piezoelectric scaffold will actively restore function by recruiting endogenous stem cells to the site of damage, and provide the appropriate electromechanical cues to promote their growth and transformation into cartilage cells. <br/><br/>A significant number of Americans suffer from cartilage damage resulting from injury, or wear and tear. These lesions can significantly affect a person's quality of life and can progress to osteoarthritis (OA) that is disabling. Cartilage damage and related OA conditions are extremely costly. Surgical procedures to restore articular cartilage have not been able to restore a normal cartilaginous surface and have suffered from poor integration with the surrounding normal articular cartilage. Consequently, a growing unmet need exists for early reconstruction of cartilage damage with a reliable treatment method that facilitates the preservation of function as well as reduces the need for future reconstruction or total joint replacements. The piezeoelectric material will be developed into a medical device for use in large cartilage defects. The commercialization potential is strong as it does not require the sale and delivery of cells as part of the device and cost effective relative to other devices in development by industry."

Of the approximately one million new breast cancer cases worldwide, many patients choose mastectomy due to a lack of viable reconstructive options. The long-term objective of this research is to build an autologous tissue structure that can integrate more naturally with the patient than conventional products. The proposed research will use a new bioprinting technology to create capillary channels that are hypothesized to anastomose with host tissue quickly, thereby allowing lab-grown tissues to survive once transplanted to the patient. The research team will build constructs, determine optimal parameters for printing tissue, and measure feasibility of anastomosis with mouse models. The results will help the development of design rules for bioprinted capillaries with respect to rapid anastomoses to the host. From here a decision can be made to move forward with testing pre-vascularized grafts in larger animals. The results of this study are expected to impact several current treatment regimes, such as autologous fat grafting for breast reconstruction following lumpectomy, affecting approximately 110,000 people in the US annually.<br/><br/><br/>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will improve the quality of life for people suffering from deformity due to cancer tumor removal, congenital defects and traumatic injuries. Patients with asymmetry following lumpectomy treatment for breast cancer are more likely to believe the cancer will reoccur and to be depressed; it is estimated that 25-30% of breast cancer patients are dissatisfied with the outcome of a lumpectomy and few reconstructive options exist for lumpectomies. The methods presented herein, if successful, should solve this problem, allowing a more natural solution utilizing the patient's own cells with a theoretically excellent prognosis. The field of Tissue Engineering is currently limited to small, thin constructs due to inadequate nutrient profusion (i. e., Vasculature). Further development of the bioprinting process and the reassembling of cells in vitro to construct vascularized tissue analogs will generate new methods and results in the fields of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine. The results of this research will help the field move towards larger, clinically relevant tissues and potentially whole organs. The commercial impacts of this research will be the availability of an autologous option for women in the lucrative $10B (US) market for breast augmentation."

This communication is generally mediated by cell surface receptors (CSRs) which receive information in the form of signalling molecules that bind to the receptors (ligands)and respond to that infomation via a signal transduction cascade that leads to a cellular response.  Thus, CSRs provide the physical/functional interface between the cell and its environment.  It is known that cell phenotype and function are correlative with changes in the cell surface, including the dynamic expression and/or distribution of  CSRs.    However,  the  present  capacity  to  track  these  potential  targets  and  signals  of  cell function is limited by both biological complexity and a lack of experimental tools.  In fact, there exists no current method to quantify this critical signature of cell state at the level of single cells within  heterogeneous  populations,  as  a  function  of  real-time  response  to  stimuli,  and  with molecular  resolution.  This  constraint  is  illustrated  by  the  increasingly  frequent  use  of combinatorial  approaches, high-throughput  screening.to  find  cell  types,  biochemical  factors, and  synthetic  substrata  that  result  in  the  desired  cell  response.  From a bioengineering perspective, there is much that could be done to benefit society (e.g., tissue  and targeted  drug  delivery  engineering) if  we  had  the  capacity  to  observe dynamic  cell-cell  and  cell-substrate  interactions  in  the  context  of  CSR  presence,  distribution, and function. From a basic fundamental perspective, there are many important but as-yet-unanswerable questions about cell surface receptor organization and function and how these effect signal transduction mechanisms that could be addressed if we had the capacity to observe these things simultaneously, in real time, with molecular resolution.  Dr. VanVliet suggests that such knowledge and the concurrent goal of engineered cell function will be enabled via biofunctionalized nanomechanical imaging of the CSR landscape on living cells.  This approach, if successful, will enable unparalleled access to real-time changes in the molecular profile of living cell surfaces, as a function of systematic variation of genetic, biochemical and mechanical stimuli. Dr. VanVliet has previously demonstrated, via collaborative investigations of nanomechanical instabilities  in  inorganic  crystals,  that dynamic  structural  adaptations  within  materials  can  be measured,  induced,  and  predicted  via  contact  deformation  of  surfaces  at  atomistic/molecular length scales.  In this Nanoscale Exploratory Research project, these powerful capabilities will be developed for dynamic living cell surfaces, in order to  extend  fundamental  understanding  of  the  CSR  interface  through  quantitative,  simultaneous structural and biochemical imaging via nanomechanical contact.   <br/><br/>The objective is to capitalize on the potential of scanning probe microscopy and molecular force spectroscopy to develop a powerful new in vitro cell surface imaging approach through direct, reversible binding between a chemically functionalized mechanical probe and the living  cell  surface.  This approach,  termed  functionalized  force  imaging  (FFI),  will  quantify  the real-time spatial and temporal distribution of CSRs and internal but near-surface cytoskeletal structure. FFI presents several distinct advantages over existing approaches for CSR analysis: This contact-based imaging does not require cleavage of the cell from its substratum, is not restricted to the analysis of proteins for which purified antibodies are available, and reveals the distribution and relative  binding  affinity  of  CSRs  that  can  be  tracked  over  time  within  individual  cells.    This project  focuses  on  the  development  of  two  specific  aspects  critical  to  the  feasibility  of nanomechanical  CSR  mapping  in  living  cells:  (1)  rapid,  spatially  biased  acquisition  of  both intermolecular  forces  and  structural/mechanical  surface  profiles;  (2)  validation  of  receptor binding  specificity  in  a  model  cell  system  for  which  the  number  of  CSRs  per  cell  can  be controlled and quantified through complementary experimental techniques. These objectives will enable the PI.s longer-term goals which include identifying mesenchymal stem and progenitor cell-specific CSR profiles, and then tracking and guiding the differentiation of these cells through external  mechanical  stimuli  for  applications  ranging  from  tissue  engineered  vasculature  to chemomechanical sensors.   <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of the research will include a new, quantitatively rigorous experimental  tool  that  will  catalyze  innovative,  cross-disciplinary  investigations  of chemomechanical coupling in biological systems.  This broader impact of this project includes a  new  laboratory-based  course  on  nanomechanical  biological  experimentation  that  will  be offered to undergraduates of MIT, Wellesley College, and Brandeis University, and that will be co-instructed by the graduate research assistant participating in the above research objectives.

The proposed reactor is expected to reduce the need to develop specific reactors whose design is specific to the cells and tissues to be studied. This advanced reactor system will build upon an initial design that was intended to permit the application of complex multi-dimensional strain to cells growing on matrices in a reactor. This system was used successfully to induce differentiation of adult mesenchymal progenitor cells into ligament forming cells, without the need for exogenous cell signaling factors, a major advance in the field. The planned improvements include a multi-dimensional force monitoring system, reactor vessel position control systems to increase options for cell seeding, and thorough fluid mechanics characterization of the reactor vessel and system to explore developmental cascades for a variety of tissues, as well as fundamental studies of cellular and tissue responses. Software for user programmable features (process variables, timing, data and sample collection) will be included.

The research component investigates a systematic approach in evaluating biomaterials as potential scaffolds for cell based therapies and integrating these concepts in new undergraduate and graduate courses in biomaterials and biocompatibility and principles of tissue engineering, respectively. The goal is to also develop a program that will have an impact on increasing the number of underrepresented groups in the field of engineering and science by introducing concepts to high school students from underrepresented minority groups and training high school teachers of all girl schools interactive approaches to teaching engineering to their students.<br/>The emerging technology of tissue engineering has the potential of becoming the therapy of choice for the regeneration of a number of damaged or diseased tissues and organs. The approach is to use cells, instead of drugs, to treat various diseases or disorders. At the forefront of investigation is the use of stem cells because of their ability to differentiate into various cell types and thus, promote the regeneration of the damaged or diseased tissue of interest. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotential cells that are capable of differentiating along several lineage pathways. MSCs, which are obtained from adult bone marrow and expanded in culture, are believed to be valuable as a readily available and abundant source of cells in the tissue engineering field. However, for treating damaged or diseased connective tissues, such as large bone fracture, osteoarthritis, tendon and ligament injuries, and spinal cord injury, MSCs must be combined with an appropriate scaffold material that promotes attachment and differentiation. For this technology to advance into clinical application, the development of improved scaffold materials is needed. The goal of this research program is to investigate in a systematic fashion the optimal surface properties and characteristics of materials that promote stem cell differentiation. <br/>The principal investigator and others have demonstrated that MSCs, when combined with bioactive ceramic scaffolds induce bone formation in large, long bone defects. However, complete repair and return of mechanical function of the long bone is limited due to the brittle nature and/or poor remodeling of the ceramic material. Other synthetic and natural biomaterials with improved mechanical and degradation properties have been investigated in in vitro experiments as potential scaffolds for the MSCs, but once implanted, MSCs fail to induce bone repair. Therefore, the objectives of the proposed research are two-fold. First, this study is designed to gain a clearer understanding of the mechanism by which calcium phosphate ceramics promote MSC differentiation and synthesis of new bone tissue by examining the effect of surface properties (e.g. chemistry and topography) and ion dissolution/reactions in influencing how stem cells adhere, the morphology they assume, and subsequent differentiation. These fundamental studies will further advance the development of improved materials for stem cell induced bone regeneration. Second, as an extension of this work, a novel study examining polymeric materials that have well defined surface properties and/or architectures that modulate stem cell morphology will be investigated. As a function of cell shape, stem cell differentiation into cell phenotypes of bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue will be examined.<br/><br/>This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in September 2004.<br/><br/>"

San Diego, to study the effects of two human enzymes known as Sulf1 and Sulf2. These enzymes act on the exterior of cell surfaces by recognizing and modifying the patterns of negatively charged groups on sugar polymers that are part of the outside coating of cells. In doing so they control the activity of proteins involved in critical cell signaling and development events. Despite being a key element in regulating important cellular functions, the structures of these enzymes and the sugars they act on are still poorly understood.  Additionally, their precise actions in a cellular context need better understanding.  This research project develops a set of new tools and techniques at the interface of chemistry and biology to fill the gaps in the basic understanding of the biological functions of these enzymes. These activities allow graduate students to obtain training in the interdisciplinary area of chemical biology focusing on carbohydrate chemistry and biology.  The students also gain a deeper understanding of the varied roles of carbohydrates in biology.  The educational and technical resources enabled by this award allow for the dissemination of the knowledge, tools, and techniques stemming from this research project to the broader research community and the general public. <br/><br/>This research develops novel methods to produce human sulfatase enzymes enabling detailed investigations of structure and mechanism. New chemical glycomics tools are envisioned to capture and structurally characterize the polysaccharide substrates for these enzymes. Further, biochemical and cell-based assays are under development to investigate their function during embryonic stem cell differentiation. The sulfatase enzymes are thought to have specificity for unique negatively charged regions of their sulfated polysaccharide substrates complementing the organization of positively charged residues in their substrate-binding domains. However, little information exists regarding the structure of the enzymes and the composition of their preferred substrates. Arrays comprising structurally defined sulfated polysaccharides from synthetic and biological sources are in use to identify preferred substrates for the sulfatase enzyme isoforms and to delineate how the enzymatic removal of sulfates from the polysaccharides impacts their interactions with growth factors. The chemical toolbox includes substrate-based fluorogenic probes for imaging sulfatase activity in biological environments and reactive molecules for chemical fingerprinting of substrates for structural characterization by mass spectrometry analysis. In combination, these tools are deployed to map how sulfatase enzymes control growth factor signaling during neural and mesenchymal differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells. The tools are general and suitable for the investigation of other biological systems where extracellular sulfatases exert important regulatory functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Under Objective 1, the aim is to define feedback mechanisms that control coupled cytoskeletal dynamics in migrating cells. It is hypothesized that adhesion-mediated signaling pathways control the duration of lamellipodial protrusion and are spatially coordinated by F-actin bundles. High-resolution, live-cell microscopy and molecular perturbations of the putative signaling and cytoskeletal processes will be applied to systematically relate perturbations of putative mechanisms regulating the actin cytoskeleton to changes in lamellipodial protrusion dynamics. These studies are expected to show how cell motility is biased by physical cues. Under Objective 2, it is proposed to elucidate the nature of haptotactic bias at the level of adhesion, signaling, and cytoskeletal dynamics. It is hypothesized that F-actin bundles/filopodia direct, and lamellipodia propagate, haptotactic exploration. A related hypothesis is that the haptotactic bias (comparing up- vs. down-gradient) manifests as differences in signaling and/or cytoskeletal dynamics, integrated by adhesions. It is proposed to analyze the dynamics of adhesion, signaling, and cytoskeletal structures during migration on haptotactic gradients generated using microfluidic devices. These studies will characterize leading-edge motility dynamics during haptotaxis, a poorly understood mode of directed migration that is distinct from chemotaxis. Under Objective 3, the proposed work will elucidate the molecular and biophysical determinants of durotaxis and define features that are common or distinct between haptotaxis and durotaxis. Hydrogels with gradients of crosslinking will be generated and integrated with traction force microscopy, a method for measuring local stress in an elastic gel. These studies will test the role of fascin-rich filopodia as sensory organelles guiding durotactic migration.

This project aims to understand how jawed vertebrates evolved from jawless fish.  This will be done by comparing the development of the modern jawless fish, lamprey, with that of two jawed vertebrates, the african clawed frog, and the zebrafish.  To do this, modern methods for manipulating gene function will be used to alter the activity of genes involved in head skeleton development.  These manipulations are aimed at partially recapitulating the evolutionary process and pinpointing which genes were most important for jaw evolution. The work will shed light on a major evolutionary event that made possible the evolution of the majority of vertebrates now living on the planet, including humans.  The project will also help elucidate how the head skeleton and jaw develops in all vertebrates and contribute to efforts to understand the developmental and genetic basis of diseases effecting the face, skull, and jaw. Additionally, the project will provide training in modern genome engineering methods for a postdoctoral scholar, two graduate students, and several undergraduate and high school students. It will also support the maintenance of a traveling museum exhibit about animal development and evolution, and accompanying public lectures by the lead investigator.<br/><br/>The morphology of early vertebrate fossils, and basally-diverging modern vertebrates, suggests that jaw evolution involved two major changes in head skeleton structure; the evolution of morphologically distinct dorsal and ventral skeletal elements, and the positioning of flexible joint tissue between these elements.  How, mechanistically, these changes occurred, is unclear.  In gnathostomes, head skeleton precursors are segregated early in development into dorsal, ventral, and intermediate domains by interactions between Jagged-Notch, BMP, and Endothelin (Edn) signaling pathways.  These signals regulate the combinatorial expression of Dlx, Msx, and Hand transcription factors which, in turn, activate the morphogenetic and differentiation programs that shape skeletal elements and specify joints.  To better understand the developmental changes underlying gnathostome head skeleton evolution, this research will utilize the living agnathan, lamprey.  Lamprey is the only extant jawless vertebrate amenable to routine embryonic manipulations. Initial gene expression studies suggested that lamprey lacks dorso-ventral restricted expression of Dlx paralogs in head skeleton precursors. Subsequent work revealed unexpectedly gnathostome-like expression of Edn signaling components, Dlx, Msx, and Hand in the forming lamprey head. Furthermore, it was found that a lamprey homolog of the joint tissue specifier, Gdf5, is expressed in mucocartilage, a soft, mesenchymal skeletal tissue histologically similar to gnathostome joint tissue.  These data supported a model in which; 1) a sophisticated gnathostome-type head skeleton patterning system predates the evolution of jaws and 2) the evolution of joints was driven by the repositioning of ancient gene programs for soft skeletal tissue differentiation within this conserved pre-pattern. The proposed work will take advantage of recent optimization of CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis in lamprey to test key predictions of this model in the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, and the frog Xenopus laevis."

It is hypothesized that F-actin bundles/filopodia direct, and lamellipodia propagate, haptotactic exploration. A related hypothesis is that the haptotactic bias (comparing up- vs. down-gradient) manifests as differences in signaling and/or cytoskeletal dynamics, integrated by adhesions. It is proposed to analyze the dynamics of adhesion, signaling, and cytoskeletal structures during migration on haptotactic gradients generated using microfluidic devices. These studies will characterize leading-edge motility dynamics during haptotaxis, a poorly understood mode of directed migration that is distinct from chemotaxis. Under Objective 3, the proposed work will elucidate the molecular and biophysical determinants of durotaxis and define features that are common or distinct between haptotaxis and durotaxis. Hydrogels with gradients of crosslinking will be generated and integrated with traction force microscopy, a method for measuring local stress in an elastic gel. These studies will test the role of fascin-rich filopodia as sensory organelles guiding durotactic migration. The results will further elucidate the relationship between cell protrusion, focal adhesion dynamics, and traction force exerted by durotaxing cells. The interdisciplinary nature of the project offers a unique environment for the training of two graduate students, who will be engaged in research and an outreach activity fostering science communication."

In this Stokesian multiphase area of biological fluid dynamics, there is no inertia, but there are forces across interfaces and transfers of forces between the fluids and fibers embedded in the fluids. In some applications, the models have multiple viscous fluids separated by active interfaces, and in others, the models have a single fluid whose motion and material properties are coupled with the motion of contractile fibers. The models will be used to gain a better understanding of the anisotropic behavior of cylindrical hydrostats (trunks, tentacles, and tongues). They will be used to increase understanding of the mechanical instabilities and pattern formation which can emerge when cells modify their extracellular matrix by moving through it or pulling on it. They will also be used to help define the developmental implications of mechanical hypotheses about how branched tubular structures (like lungs) form in the body. Some results will generate interpretations of theories, some will suggest experiments to test the implications of theories, and some will suggest industrial applications of biomechanical principles. The project will also develop the finite difference numerical methods necessary to solve the partial differential equations arising from modeling the physical forces in these tissues. The development of robust three-dimensional algorithms for the solution of biological fluid dynamics problems will be key to the effective modeling of dozens of problems in the mechanics of cell motion and tissue remodeling.<br/><br/>This project involves several biomedical problems in the dynamics of tissues. At all stages of an organism's existence there are mechanical forces at work. How does a completely round egg get to be a very complicated-looking human being, with limbs and eyes and ducts and glands and a wrinkled brain? There are genes that switch on and off, but that is not the whole story. An airplane has switches too, but to understand how it really works, we need to study fluid mechanics - the physical forces that lift, stabilize, and occasionally disturb the craft. Fluid dynamics is equally relevant to biology. As an organism - or part of it - is growing, it creates physical forces, and is shaped by physical forces. The science of Tissue Dynamics is relatively new, and requires expertise in many areas. A biological modeler, a numerical analyst, a developmental biologist, and an industrial researcher have teamed up to study the biomechanics of tissues which are changing their shape, size, strength, orientation, and function. Results of the work should increase our understanding of processes in developmental biology, wound healing, cancer, vascular health and disease, and many other areas of biomedicine involving tissues.

In recent years, systems biology has emerged as a discipline to examine biological complexity from the point-of-view of integrated systems rather than separate components (the reductionists? point-of-view). A systems approach may help to resolve many fundamental issues in the life sciences that relate to systems-level interactions rather than individual biomolecular species. To achieve a full systems-level description, many new analytical techniques and theories need to be developed, in addition to new experimental advances. One major challenge concerns computational modeling of biological dynamics by differential equations. Due to the complexity of any particular biochemical control system, a large number of variables and parameters are needed to describe its dynamics. To have the desired predictive power, the values of these parameters need to be determined with sufficient precision, but for most systems the requisite experimental data are not available. This is a general problem in many areas of science, including physics and chemistry, where the powerful Mori-Zwanzig projection method is widely used for studying Hamiltonian dynamics. In this method, the complex dynamical system is first separated into primary and secondary subsystems.  Through systematic information contraction, one can focus on the primary system, which contains the variables of primary interest (in particular, experimentally resolvable variables). The secondary subsystem is not treated explicitly, but its effect on the primary system is properly accounted for mathematically. In this proposal, the researchers will develop a general formalism and numerical algorithms for non-Hamiltonian systems without detailed balance, with a focus on cellular regulatory networks. The method will be especially useful in three cases: 1) where a coarse-grained model is desirable, or available data prevents a more detailed model; 2) where the network under study is embedded in a larger network; and 3) where one wants to perform multi-scale modeling. <br/><br/>The proposed methods will provide a powerful tool for systems biologists to approach the ultimate goals of understanding complex biological processes and of  improving human health. One encounters similar situations, of dealing with a complex system with incomplete information, in many other research areas, for example: financial transactions, the power supply network, and the spread and evolution of viruses during an epidemic or a bioterrorist attack."

Cells can also actively generate forces, to probe and deform materials in their surrounding environment. These dynamic interactions between clusters of cells and their environment are critical to an immense range of activities including early development and cancer progression. In recent years there has been a growing interest to uncover what drives cells to escape from growing clusters, either independently or in collective streams. However, a thorough understanding of the biophysics governing such activity is lacking. To address these issues, a novel computational and experimental framework will be developed to investigate how the interplay between cellular forces, adhesion, and environmental physics drive cells to proliferate, escape, and invade distant regions of the body. The new tools proposed will impact many areas in biology, including normal and abnormal tissue development, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. The innovative mathematical models and methods will advance computing in biology as well as other fields of science such as bioengineering and biotechnology.<br/><br/>Current mathematical models cannot predict why cells invade from a proliferative cluster and migrate either independently or as collective strands, which determines the metastatic risk of invading cells during cancer progression. This problem will be addressed through a novel multi-scale framework that integrates computational models of highly non- linear matrix mechanics, force-mediated cell signaling, and active cell contractility. Such an approach will provide a new understanding of the mechanisms by which matrix properties promote or discourage cell invasion, and why cells tend to either move collectively or act alone. In particular, the critical role of cell-mediated matrix remodeling, long range force transmission, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) will be uncovered. The kinetics of cell invasion requires the formation of protrusions, assembly and dissolution of adhesions, and remodeling of contractile actomyosin fibers. These stochastic processes will be modelled using Kinetic Monte Carlo methods, that will explicitly account for fluctuations in the cell?s response to its environment. Additionally, a novel multi-scale bio-chemo-mechanical model of tissue growth will be developed to predict formation of arbitrarily shaped cell clusters and to quantify how complex patterns of cells emerge from such clusters. This research will lead to a paradigm shift in the mathematical modelling of cell invasion by explicitly including signalling, non-linear matrix mechanics and the two-way recursive dialog between cells and the matrix.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to enhance our knowledge of how embryonic neural crest stem cells form the tissues that make the face in closely related organisms, and how these stem cells give rise distinct outer appearances. To achieve this goal, Dr. Rogers at UC Davis will work with undergraduate students recruited from primarily undergraduate and Hispanic-serving institutions to dissect the programs that regulate the formation of neural crest cells in three bird species. The dual research and educational project called Functional Analysis of Crest EffectorS (FACES), will identify how changing the expression of these proteins at early embryonic stages drives differences in beak structure in quail, chicken, and peafowl embryos. Dr. Rogers has a strong background in studying neural crest cells and early development across various species, and is one of the few investigators in the world performing cross-species analyses to define the molecular control of cell specification and cell migration in avians. This faculty Early Career Development Award (CAREER) will fund a research and educational program that provides professional growth, hands-on research opportunities and long-term mentoring for undergraduate students, and will increase our fundamental understanding of how complex tissues are formed during vertebrate embryonic development. By asking the question, ?what regulates the cells that make the face?? we can unravel the mechanisms driving formation of faces in different species. <br/><br/>Much of the information we know about neural crest development has been identified independently in a handful of model organisms, and the findings have been incorporated into a neural crest gene regulatory network model to resolve protein-gene interactions. However, we lack confirmation of the functional conservation of proteins across species, thereby making comprehensive understanding of neural crest evolution and development challenging. Although the expression of the factors that regulate neural crest development are conserved, we do not know if they function at the same developmental time, regulate the same targets, or if changes in these factors drive phenotypic variation across species. This CAREER will directly address this barrier to knowledge by defining the roles of three SOXE (SRY-related HMG box Group E) transcription factors, and their putative targets, type I and II cadherin molecules, in the formation of neural crest cells and their craniofacial derivatives. Quail, chick, and peafowl embryos will be used to compare expression timing, protein function, and outcome of protein perturbations on craniofacial (beak) formation. The objectives are to 1) identify the roles of SOXE factors during neural crest (NC) specification and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in chick versus quail embryos, 2) determine the cadherin code that controls NC cell fate and EMT in chick vs quail, and 3) quantify the effects of SOXE and cadherin perturbations on craniofacial beak structure. Collectively, this work will shed light on the molecular, cellular, and organismal-level mechanisms that drive neural crest cell formation and will significantly increase our understanding of how organisms use the same factors to drive differential morphogenesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One such migratory cell type, the neural crest, gives rise to portions of the heart, components of the gut and sensory nervous systems, skin pigment cells, and the head skeleton. The central question of this research is to investigate the pathways controlling how neural crest cells become migratory. To address this question, an innovative, multidisciplinary approach will be taken that spans the single cell to whole embryo. Results from these experiments will shed light on processes regulating neural crest cell migration, providing immediate relevance with respect to the fundamental mechanisms controlling the directed movement of cells during development and maintenance of adult tissues. The broader impacts of this project will occur by providing 1) experiential research opportunities for both underrepresented groups at a local high school and college as well as University of Maryland undergraduates as part of their teaching certification and 2) professional development opportunities through the integration of research and teaching at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. As such, this project will help better prepare the next generation of scientists for careers in both academic and non-academic settings. <br/><br/>Technical Paragraph: <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to uncover mechanisms underlying epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) by studying the role of cadherin proteolytic peptides, extracellular N-terminal fragments (NTFs) and intracellular C-terminal fragment 2 (CTF2), using chick cranial neural crest cells (NCCs). Cranial NCC EMT requires multiple cellular and molecular changes, including Cadherin-6B proteolysis to decrease adhesion among NCCs as well as the segregation of NCCs from the neural tube basement membrane. The Taneyhill lab?s publications have demonstrated that Cadherin-6B NTFs and CTF2 promote NCC EMT through distinct mechanisms. NTFs activate matrix metalloproteinase 2 and enhance degradation of the extracellular matrix within the basement membrane through which premigratory NCCs must emerge, while CTF2 binds to ?-catenin and interacts with chromatin to transcriptionally activate NCC EMT effector genes. Through a novel mass spectrometry assay, the lab has now identified (and confirmed) NTF interacting proteins. Moreover, the lab has recently discovered and validated new targets of CTF2 during NCC EMT through RNA-sequencing. Building on these results, the aims of the  research are 1) to define the function of Cadherin-6B NTFs in promoting EMT and 2) to determine the role, and the mechanism(s) of regulation, of CTF2 target genes during NCC EMT. These aims will be achieved using biochemistry; molecular perturbation and genomics assays; and immunohistochemistry coupled with high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscopy with Airyscan detection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how tissues are formed and shaped during development is important for the prevention of birth defects and to understand how to repair wounded tissues, yet this remains largely unknown since the problem is very complex. Because the mechanisms underlying development are well-conserved in evolution, much can be learned from studying the development of simple organisms such as sea urchins. The proposed research focuses on the mechanisms underlying the patterning of the sea urchin larval skeleton, which is produced by one type of cell (mesodermal cells), reacting to signals from other cells on the surface of the embryo (ectodermal cells).  Previous work by this PI uncovered a number of ectodermal signals that serve as instructions for the skeletal pattern. The PI now proposes to determine how four of those signals each change the mesodermal cells to direct their movement within the embryo. This work will discover the sequence of all the RNA inside single cells in order to understand how these four signals alter which RNA and proteins are made in each of the sixty mesodermal. It will also identify and test the response to the four signals by receptor proteins in the mesodermal cells. In addition to performing scientific outreach in the Boston area, the PI will train students in scientific research, including female high school students in summer internships, undergraduate students performing independent studies, and graduate students seeking Ph.D.s.  <br/><br/>The proposed research focuses on the mechanism underlying skeletal patterning during sea urchin development. The skeleton is secreted by primary mesenchymal cells (PMCs), while the patterning information is contained within the ectoderm, and sensed by the migrating PMCs. The PI previously identified numerous novel ectodermal cues that pattern the skeleton, and here proposes to determine how four distinct and conserved cues (sulfated proteoglycans, 5-HETEs, VEGF, and Univin) modulate gene expression within the PMCs to promote their diversification by using single-cell mRNA sequencing on individual PMCs in control embryos and in embryos in which specific patterning cues are inhibited. The combined results from time-course and perturbation analyses will be integrated into a temporal network model for PMC diversification; this network will extend the previously determined early specification network for PMCs. Key genes in the new diversification network will be functionally tested using knockdown approaches combined with in vitro PMC migration analyses. A novel approach will be used to fix cells following in vitro migration while preserving their spatial positions, which will allow determination of the behavior of specific PMC subsets following migration toward or away from specific cues."

These failed products have the potential to result in adverse health outcomes for trial participants and billions in lost capital each year. The manufacturing of artificial human tissue samples is a potential way of predicting human response to new, regulated products. These manufacturing processes are being designed to use special bioprinters to print human cells in three dimensional (3D) constructs.  The goal is to use these synthetic tissues as another screening step to reveal potential hazards of new medical products before they enter human testing.  The eventual goal would be that only the safest, most effective products reach human testing. The 3D printing process, however, exerts mechanical forces on the cells and leads to cellular dysfunction or death. This project is a collaboration between researchers in biomaterials at the University of Kentucky and cellular biomechanics and bioprinting experts at the United States Food & Drug Administration to determine how 3D printing procedures may change the way cells behave.  Changes in cellular physiology and behavior can, in turn, affect the usefulness of the artificial tissues for medical product screening. As a result of this work, researchers will be able to better predict if printed cells will return to their natural function and how long after being printed this function will be restored. With this new information, researchers will be able to develop and evaluate new methods to preserve normal cellular function during tissue manufacturing. During this project, the research team will also develop publicly available, educational tools that describe the science and engineering concepts underlying three dimensional bioprinting.<br/><br/>This project seeks to determine how 3D bioprinting affects cellular physiology, in particular cellular membrane transport.  It is known that the high shear environment of the bioprinting nozzle impacts cellular response; however, the precise changes in the cells and whether normal function can be recovered within a range of bioprinting parameters has not been assessed.  This gap in knowledge makes it difficult to determine if a 3D printed tissue actually will replicate normal (or defined pathological) physiology -- a key feature if such bioprinted tissue structures are going to be used for pre-clinical assessment of drugs or medical devices.  The scientific objectives of this proposal are to: 1) quantify the magnitude and timescale of unnatural transport across the cell membrane, including multiple forms of active and passive transport, following simulated extrusion bioprinting; and 2) quantify how cellular coatings, which are hypothesized to protect cells from mechanical damage, affect the extrusion-based alterations in cellular membrane transport.  In addition to measurements of membrane transport, appropriate assays for basic cell function and viability will also be conducted for each cell type.  Experiments will be conducted using five cell lines (HepG2 - hepatic; Caco2 - intestinal; H9C2 - myocardial; A549 - human lung carcinoma; and mesenchymal stem cells), each of which is of current interest in the biomanufacturing arena.  This collaboration will result in mutual education, with the post-doctoral fellow becoming trained in the area of regulatory affairs and the PI educating CDRH (Center for Devices and Radiologic Health) team members at the FDA on emerging technology for encapsulated cell systems and devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research involves the fact that synthetic biological materials must include ?smart? functional properties ? self-regulation, self-healing, environmental responsiveness, and self-sustainability ? to function as engineered living materials (ELMs), which are poised to revolutionize present-day materials technologies. ELMs can offer insights into the development of living organs, the organization of multiple organ systems, and the production of autonomously sensing and healing materials. However, the large-scale manufacture of engineered living materials has been difficult to achieve, owing to a lack of control of both materials? organization and cell and molecule placement over multiple length scales. This proposal addresses this gap by developing microstructured hydrophilic polymer hydrogels. The polymer solutions used in this proposal have the unique capability of reversibly changing concentration in the presence of specific compounds, which will allow the use of micron-scale robots to deliver these compounds to produce patterned hydrogels. These approaches will be integrated with cells to generate highly ordered cell-gel materials with high cell viability. The precise and programmable spatial control of hydrogel properties will enable localized differentiation of stem cells to form engineered living materials, and subsequent manufacture of complex tissues for advancing national health.

The large-scale manufacture of ELMs requires the reliable control of both materials? organization and cell and molecule placement over multiple length scales. The overarching goal of this proposal is to generate polymer hydrogels with regular microstructured regions of distinct mechanical properties, based largely on resilin-like polypeptides (RLPs) derived from the bioelastomer resilin. RLP-based solutions have the unique capability of reversibly changing concentration in the presence of small-molecule and polymeric co-solutes. The working hypothesis in this proposal is that the microrobotic delivery of polyethylene glycol (PEG) will rapidly trigger a locally increased concentration of RLPs near microrobots, leading to the formation of mechanically distinct microstructured regions in the bioelastomer. The coincident use of a digital micromirror display (DMD) system will permit the co-localization of light, thus initiating crosslinking and generating localized microstructures with unprecedented precision. The development of magnetic microrobot control strategies will enable control of microrobotic swarms for large-scale delivery of PEG. Microrobots capable of triggered delivery of molecules at desired coordinates with high precision will also enable spatiotemporal control of bioactive molecules and factors which can be used to temporally alter cellular function. To confirm the survival, metabolic activity, and proliferative capacity of cells in/on these microrobotically patterned, cytocompatible bioelastomeric hydrogels, commercially available human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) will be encapsulated in/on the patterned RLP-based hydrogels and their proliferation will be tested.<br/><br/>The proposed research was submitted in response to the NSF2026 Idea Machine winning entry ""Engineered Living Materials"".<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in order to be effectively used, these cells must be manufactured efficiently, controllably, and reproducibly. Culturing and expanding cells while enhancing their desired function is essential for biomanufacturing, and critical for ultimate use of cells to understand and treat human disease. This proposal focuses on biomanufacturing two important cell types, namely human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) that have been used in over 500 human clinical trials, and endothelial cells (ECs) that form human blood vessels.  Developing a better in vitro understanding and control over regulation of hMSC and EC behaviors such as adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation may facilitate their efficient manufacturing and increased success as cell therapies. This research program will lead to understanding of cell behaviour, and to more effective manufacturing of therapeutic cells, by developing biomaterials to mimic parts of the native extracellular matrix (ECM).  These biomaterials in the form of polymer coatings will aid in answering key fundamental questions in cell biology and provide an efficient, well-defined platform for cell biomanufacturing. The resulting polymer-coated ""microcarriers"" for 3D cell expansion can be delivered to cell biologists and bioengineers, who can then customize them to probe key biological questions. Hands-on exhibits developed on Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering through this research will be disseminated nationally by the PI's and the graduate students. The research program will serve to inspire and involve undergraduate students in polymer science and engineering research, by working with graduate student mentors.<br/> <br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This research program will study the synthesis of polymer coatings to answer key fundamental questions in cell biology using 2D coatings, and to develop polymer-coated microcarriers that provide an efficient, well-defined platform for cell biomanufacturing. These key fundamental goals include: i) understanding the influence of local and global coating compositions on cellular behaviors; ii) understanding the role of substrate-mediated growth factor (GF) sequestering on GF-dependent cell expansion; and iii) exploring the influence of controlled, divalent presentation of receptor-binding peptides on receptor activation and associated cell behavior. These studies will result in the design of an efficient copolymer coating and ligation chemistry to present receptor-coreceptor clusters with controlled spacing to study their influence on GF signaling and associated cell behaviors. To quantitatively characterize the functionality of the surface, this research will develop Time of Flight-Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) in conjunction with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and assess the local and global heterogeneities in surface composition. The outcome of this research will be the synthesis of chemically defined microcarriers via a copolymer chemistry that is customizable to different cell types and culture media with relevant bio-inspired peptides that regulate cell adhesion and GF sequestering. We envision a new class of microcarriers that use customizable polymer coatings, lower the currently intractable cost of media formulations, and achieve efficient, xeno-free expansion of functional therapeutic cells. The ability to tailor microcarriers to support adhesion and receptor activation of specific cell types without using complex and expensive media would be transformative in biomanufacturing, which is a rapidly growing segment of health care in cell and tissue therapy."

One such theory, Dollo?s Law, which states that once lost, complex characters cannot be re-evolved, has challenged biologists for more than a century.  Despite recent evidence suggesting that complex characters can and do re-evolve, there is a lack of understanding of how and why these evolutionary reversals take place.  The proposed study will address these questions by elucidating the functional underpinnings and the developmental mechanisms of complex trait re-evolution. This project will result in an unprecedented integration of functional morphology and developmental genetics in an evolutionary framework, facilitating communication between these fields.<br/><br/>The research project will use an integrative approach that synthesizes developmental genetics and functional morphology in a phylogenetic framework to study limb and digit loss and subsequent re-evolution in the Southeast Asian burrowing lizard genus Brachymeles.  Objectives of the proposed research are to determine whether a phenotypic trait that has been lost re-evolves with the same or different functional capacities, and whether re-evolved digits develop via the same or different developmental mechanisms as ancestral digits.  Surface locomotor velocity, acceleration, and burrowing speed and force will be quantified using high-speed video and a force transducer for ancestrally and re-evolved pentadactyl, intermediate, and limbless species. The developmental basis of limb and digit reduction and re-evolution in Brachymeles will be characterized to identify hypothesized developmental constraints on limb and digit re-evolution.  Mesenchymal condensations of digits in embryos will be identified using histochemistry and in situ hybridization of nine genes associated with limb and digit patterning. The project will be also involve and train undergraduate and graduate students in research methods and will promote international collaborations.  Minority and female students will be actively recruited and encouraged to participate in the research training opportunities provided by the project.  Biologically themed outreach programs resulting from this project will target disadvantaged communities and local K-12 schools.  Findings from the proposed project will be publicly disseminated online as part of an established biodiversity information website (http://philbreo.lifedesks.org/), at scientific conferences, in peer-reviewed journals, and through other existing databases (http://datadryad.org/)."

Surgeries of load bearing tissues such as tendons and ligaments are occurring by hundreds of thousands annually and existing synthetic analogs of collagen have extremely poor biomechanical properties in comparison to the tissues they are targeted to replace. This shortcoming is due, in part, to the lack of orientation in hierarchical orders above the level of fibers.  <br/><br/>This project will improve the strength and viscoelasticity of synthetic collagenous constructs to match those of natural counterparts by: a) an unconventional electrochemical process to attain an unprecedented level of molecular alignment and molecular packing density persistent across all levels of structural hierarchies, and, 2) the control of interfibrillar attachment by use of a biomimetic decorin-like linkage molecule.  Phase 1 of proposed studies will optimize the mechanical strength and stiffness of the construct by elucidating the mechanisms by which collagen solutions achieve long-range order under the effect of weak currents applied directly to the solutions.  The effects of electric current amplitude and collagen concentration on the hierarchical organization of collagen will be investigated to optimize the synthesis process.  The strength of resulting oriented collagen gels will be improved by identifying the appropriate type and concentration of crosslinking amongst glutaraldehyde, genipin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) or ribose.  Phase 2 will modulate the viscoelastic properties of oriented and crosslinked gels by decorin mimics consisting of dermatan sulfate attached to peptide motifs which selectively bind to type I collagen molecules. Mechanical properties of resulting synthetic constructs will be assessed at the bundle and the fiber levels by macroscale mechanical tests and atomic force microscopy, respectively, and compared to those of rat tendon, a reference natural tissue.  The third phase is going to assess the phenotypic and genotypic response of tendon fibroblasts seeded in three-dimensional networks of the oriented collagenous construct in vitro, and, by assessing the non-enzymatic and enzymatic degradation rates of constructs in vitro.  <br/><br/>The project will include the outreach component of familiarizing the minority middle-school student population with the emerging field of biomedical engineering. This aim will be attained by a summer activity during which students will conduct hands-on projects in the area of biomedical engineering through coordination with the Minority Engineering Program at Purdue University.

Current procedures are fraught with problems that limit clinical success. One important approach for the treatment of bone fractures and defects is in the use of injectable fillers or cements. However, current bone cements do not adequately support bone healing, and may lead to poor clinical outcomes. This project utilizes a novel method in preparing polymers to generate an injectable bone filler that cures within the body, and forming a rigid and strong foam implant. This specially prepared polymer composite is expected to promote bone regeneration and growth by stimulating cells around the polymer. In addition to improving care for patients that suffer from traumatic bone injuries, these studies will provide exceptional training of future scientists in materials research. Educational and outreach activities will focus on strategies that enhance recruitment and retention of women and minorities in science and engineering areas in addressing the national needs to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in the scientific and engineering workforce. Finally, this Israeli-US partnership provides opportunities to train students to compete globally through a summer internship exchanges at the partnering laboratories.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL: <br/>Current injectable bone cements used for bone fracture and repairs are of limited value because of lack of cement porosity, limited biodegradability, prolonged recovery time and lack of significant stabilization and support of the damaged bones. In addition, these synthetic scaffolds lack cellular cues to promote bone repair and regeneration, without the addition of growth factors in the injectable cements, and these involve high costs and safety concerns. To address these issues, this project will develop a novel high internal phase emulsion graft polymers (polyHIPE) using an emulsion-templating method. The graft polymers prepared will be used to generate injectable bone fillers that cure within the body to form rigid foams that are: 1) surface-modified with collagen-mimetic proteins to induce osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells; and 2) prepared without surfactants to minimize concerns with respect to biocompatibility of leached breakdown products from these surfactants. Additionally, bioactive nanoparticles with different size, distribution, and hydrophobicity will be incorporated in these graft polymers, and these nanoparticles are expected to migrate spontaneously to the pore surface of the foam during curing process in the body. This migration of nanoparticle not only strengthen the cured polymer cement but is also expected to promote enhanced bone regeneration by stimulating cells in the polymer pores. Overall, these studies are designed such that fundamental advances will be made in synthesis and application of novel materials for the integrin-mediated osteogenesis for injectable bone grafts. Although this work is focused on bone repair and regeneration, the knowledge gained has potential to be applied to a variety of other applications such as development of membranes with well-defined pore size in battery and for water purification. Students participating in the research will receive rigorous training in material science and tissue engineering that will prepare them for careers in biomedical engineering. This collaboration with Israeli scientists would also provide opportunities in training students through a summer internship exchange at the partnering laboratory and prepare these students to compete globally. An integrated educational platform will focus on strategies that enhance recruitment and retention of women and minorities in engineering to address the national need to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in the scientific and engineering workforce."

It is cofunded by the BioMaps program and funds from the ENG/CBET/BBBE program. At present, new drugs are developed by screening hundreds of possible candidates against cancer cells grown on plastic surfaces.  Drugs that show potential are further tested in animals, and anywhere from zero to a handful of candidates could make it through this process, where they are then taken to clinical trials. Drug candidates that appear successful in cells on the plastic surfaces often fail in clinical trials. Overall, this process is long and not cost effective. The biomaterials that are being studied have potential use in understanding how cancer cells respond to drugs in an environment that mimics human tissue, and thereby overcomes some of the drawbacks of the present approaches. With this award, the PI plans to develop new educational opportunities for students from high school to graduate levels. High school students, especially women will be trained in the PI's laboratory during the summer months, where these students can learn how to do cell culture and 3D printing techniques and to observe how cells move and grow on different material surfaces. Undergraduate students will be trained in creating new pathways to take ownership and authorship of their learning experience, resulting in educational modules that can be used across the nation.

A core problem of the current drug screening techniques that utilize plastic multi-well plates is that it fails to account for a cell's native material microenvironment. This CAREER project will take a transformative approach to drug screening by quantifying cancer cell responses to drugs in a biomaterial platform mimicking the rapidly evolving material properties of the tumor microenvironment, specifically a material microenvironment that is continually remodeled by resident mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). This proposal will use a high-throughput biomaterial platform to determine how three dimensional matrix stiffness, integrin binding, and soluble growth factors and cytokines impact cancer cell response to drugs. The underlying hypothesis is that physical and biochemical cues from an MSC-remodeled extracellular matrix (ECM) interfere with the efficacy small molecule drugs, and that targeting the MSCs, not the cancer cells, can halt this drug resistance. The results from this proposal would transform our fundamental understanding of the role that the physical environment plays in interfering with small molecule drugs. The PI will leverage CAREER funding to increase educational opportunities in bioengineering at three levels: high school, undergraduate, and graduate. The PI has already created a new summer laboratory program at University of Massachusetts at Amherst that teaches high school students cell culture and advanced microscopy techniques.  Over the next few years, the PI plans to create new educational modules for undergraduate students that are specifically aimed at self-directed learning techniques and fostering creativity and teamwork in the classroom.  Additionally, the PI plans to expand recruiting efforts nationwide, in collaboration with the Diversity Institute at the campus, to bring more qualified students from underrepresented groups to campus, and train them to become the future leaders in science and engineering."

Successful completion of this project will prove the concept of the technique and lay a solid foundation for further developing the system into a revolutionary therapy for various human diseases. The project will also promote education and training of the next-generation workforce in biomanufacturing.<br/><br/>While cells play a central role in the cell-based therapies, the functionalities of the cells are limited by their biological nature. On the other hand, artificial microdevices can offer numerous functionalities radically distinct from those of the cells. These two sets of the functionalities can be integrated into a single system by forming a complex composed of a cell and a microdevice. This system holds potential to revolutionize cell-based therapies. However, current methods for generating such complexes are only applicable to cells with certain properties, or they are associated with serious toxicity issues. Moreover, cell-microdevice complexes with clinically useful functionalities have not yet been realized. The goal of this proposed research is to overcome these limitations by developing a technique that allows microdevices to harmlessly bind to all human therapeutic cells and using this technique to produce complexes with an ability to target disease-related cells. The specific aims are (1) to establish the proposed method for producing the designed cell-microdevice complexes, and (2) to characterize and optimize the cell-microdevice complexes with respect to the stability of the complexes, viability and functionalities of the cells in the complexes, and the targeting ability of the complexes. Methods developed by one of the investigators will be extended to produce the complexes. The universal binding mechanism will be based on the hydrophobic interaction between hydrocarbon chains and a cell membrane. An antibody will be grafted to the microdevices to render the cell-microdevice complexes capable of targeting cancer cells. Besides research, the investigators will carry out education and outreach activities along with the proposed research. If successful, the project will generate knowledge on the technique to generate the complexes and on the properties of the complexes. It will also lay a foundation for developing the system into a new class of cell-based therapeutics for treating various devastating diseases and traumas such as cancer and spinal cord injury. In addition, the proposed education and outreach activities will provide interdisciplinary education and research training in biomanufacturing to graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students."

To accomplish this, the principle investigator will integrate functionally patterned graphene and graphene derivatives into bioscaffolds to control and measure the fundamental biophysical cues that encode information for human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) growth and differentiation. Electrical connections to the graphene bioscaffolds will serve to modulate temperature and electrical fields while also actively monitoring the electrochemical exchange at the cell-graphene interface during growth and differentiation. In order to elucidate graphene's structure-property-processing correlations on hMSC differentiation, genetic profiles will be compared for hMSC growth on epitaxial graphene on SiC substrates, polycrystalline graphene films grown by chemical vapor deposition on copper foils, and graphene films printed from chemically exfoliated graphene nanoflakes. Electrical bias applied to the graphene films will be used to monitor the effect of transmembrane voltage on hMSC fate, as well as the impact of electrical signals on extracellular matrix production and the mechanical properties of engineered musculoskeletal tissue. Intellectual Merit: The fundamental knowledge gained will enable a complete set of design rules for electrically active bioscaffolds that can couple or decouple biophysical cues responsible for stem cell growth and differentiation. The data produced through these experiments will be made publicly available to further advance in silico research of biomolecular processes and subsequent integration in virtual physiological human models. Broader Impacts: By integrating graphene into the tissue engineering cycle, potentially transformational outcomes will likely include new instrumentation for stem cell culture, new multifunctional bioscaffold materials, and new research avenues for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Integrated educational outreach activities leverage a local dual-language immersion public charter school and undergraduate service-learning programs to raise awareness about STEM opportunities for English language learners. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>Stem cells offer the remarkable ability to develop into many different cell types and tissues. Thus, they not only have the potential to cure damaged or diseased organs, but also provide a platform to study the fundamental chemistry of life. Researchers have long studied stem cell biology in vitro with a focus on the impact of biochemical reactions and mechanical cues on stem cell fate. These scientists culture stem cells on various types of materials which serve as bioscaffolds, engineering the materials to leverage the mechanical crosstalk between the stem cell and the scaffold to control their fate. There are few investigations that leverage electrical and thermal cues which vary in space and time to control stem cell fate. The recent discovery of graphene (a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a 2-dimensional hexagonal crystal structure) has opened up new possibilities for bioscaffolds to control such electrical and thermal interactions with stem cells. Therefore, the goal of this NSF CAREER award is to integrate graphene with stem cell biology to uncover the fundamental interactions of these two systems. Intellectual Merit The proposed work will have an impact on stem cell biology and atomically thin materials research by providing new fundamental insights into the role of electrical and thermal cues in controlling stem cell fate. Broader Impacts: Achieving control over stem cell fate could revolutionize tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, reducing dependence on organ donors to treat patient end-stage organ failure. Scientific outreach activities will help establish a pipeline of English language learners from a local dual-language immersion program into Boise State University's STEM programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Here a novel delivery system is proposed that integrates engineered poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers and biologically extracted exosomes derived from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). It is hypothesized that overall tumor targeting of the novel biomimetic hybrid nanoparticles, or BioHNPs, will be significantly enhanced, with minimized potential immunogenicity or toxicity concerns. Specifically, BioHNPs will take advantage of three unique mechanisms: i) hMSC homing to inflamed tissue, involving rolling, firm adhesion, and extravasation, which is frequently observed in activated, angiogenic cancerous regions; ii) dendrimer-mediated multivalent targeting; and iii) efficient penetration of dendrimers across tumor tissue. In addition, using such exosomes derived from individual patients as outer layers of the nanocarriers, this approach will ultimately achieve truly personalized medicine, which will be potentially transformative in designing and engineering not only BioHNPs proposed here but also other novel nanocarriers. The new design of the nanocarriers will be validated via a series of physicochemical and biological assays through achieving three objectives: i) Functionalization and hybridization of hMSC-derived exosomes and PAMAM dendrimers; ii) In vitro selectivity tests of BioHNPs against endothelial and cancer cells; and iii) Tumor spheroid model study for tissue penetration and diffusion of BioHNPs<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PIs propose to develop an implantable scaffold containing artificial blood vessels, as well as appropriate biochemicals that can induce connections between the host tissue blood vessels and the engineered blood vessels.  The success of this project will provide critical insights into how to influence and optimize this necessary integration between scaffold implants and host tissue, thereby accelerating regeneration of large tissues with severely damaged vessel networks.

Currently, 3D printing of plastic is a relatively common process and is often available in public libraries or service centers for a nominal fee. 3D printing has tremendous potential for applications in biology and medicine. For example, with a 3D printer, one could create structures of multiple cell types placed together with a precise geometry in a single Petri dish to replicate the types of cell interactions that are present in human organs. These engineered tissues could be used outside of the body to predict how different types of drugs may interact with humans or could be used inside the body to replace damaged tissues. However, the use of this technique to print cell-containing materials remains a difficult challenge. This is in part due to the unavailability of bio-inks that are both cell-compatible and have the physical and chemical properties required to be printable. Here, the PIs plan to develop a family of bio-inks with the properties required for printing as well as the ability to protect cells and maintain their viability during and after the printing process.

This hydrogel will be synthesized using novel polymeric crosslinkers that degrade through oxidative mechanisms relevant to sites of wounded and inflamed tissues (e.g., diabetic skin wounds).  Optimized hydrogel formulations will be applied for substrate-mediated siRNA delivery to encapsulated MSCs in situ.

Macrophages wrap themselves around a foreign particle, engulfing and digesting it. This process, called phagocytosis, involves both chemistry and physical forces. Though the process of phagocytosis has been well studied biochemically, this project takes a different perspective: it treats the macrophage as a machine and the phagocytic process as a mechanical event. What are the forces? How do they coordinate? How does the machine work?  Without understanding forces, we lack a complete scientific description of phagocytosis and, more broadly, the immune response itself. The project employs both advanced microscopic techniques as well as unique force measurement methods to investigate the three-dimensional structure of the macrophage in real time while simultaneously measuring the forces it generates. The data generated from this project will provide a more comprehensive model of this fundamental biological process that integrates the biochemistry, the structure, and the biophysical forces. Another critical component of the overall project is bringing the research to the public to help inform folks on the latest exciting science that is happening in the lab. Broader impact projects include a virtual-reality-based exhibit that will be developed at a local museum, and a week-long biophysics ?mini-term? that will be taught at a local high school. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to use advanced imaging and force measurement tools to reveal the mechanisms of force generation and mechanosensing in phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process through which macrophages, neutrophils and other cells engulf large foreign pathogen particles as a first line of immune system defense. To engulf a target particle, one or more distinct actin-driven mechanical processes draws in the target, surrounds and encloses it.  Along with biochemical signaling dynamics, phagocytosis is also driven by fundamentally mechanical processes involving forces and structural dynamics.  The most fundamental questions are unanswered: What forces does a macrophage produce? What actin dynamics and associated cell morphological dynamics give rise to them? How do external forces and mechanical environment affect decision making in phagocytosis? Measurements directly associating macrophage-target forces with actin dynamics are a crucial missing piece to developing models of the engulfment process. Within this project, a set of hypotheses will be tested that are guided by analogous mechanisms that have been proposed for other cell systems such as the ?molecular clutch? mechanism in mesenchymal motility which provides force generation as well as mechanosensing.  Measurements of macrophage force generation during engulfment will be performed along with accompanying high quality, live cell volumetric imaging of cell morphology and cytoskeletal dynamics. This will be complemented by use of soft beads as targets to measure local compressive and shear forces being imposed by the macrophage on the target.  Quantitative spatio-temporal correlation analysis of volumetric actin dynamics and force measurements will also be performed.  This will provide rich detailed data informing location and timing of the local dynamic actin remodeling that produce a specific macrophage force event. If successful, the project will produce a completely new dynamical atlas of the macrophage that maps the relationship of dynamic 3D cell morphology and actin dynamics with local force generation and mechanosensing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed research will be groundbreaking through electrochemical-compaction (ELC) of collagen-rich protein solution using micropatterned electrodes, thus creating the provision for designing arrays of pores with controlled size and distribution.  The utility of ELC will be assessed in terms of fabricating scaffolds for tendon repair.  First aim studies will provide fundamental insight on the effects of matrix anisotropy and matrix modulus (in a range of MPa to GPa) on differentiation and matrix deposition by adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (aMSCs).  The topographical differentiation cues will be supplemented with compositional cues by including dermatan sulfate (DS), a glycosaminoglycan richly present in tendon, in the matrix.  That material formulation determined to be the most conducive to desired cell response will be used in second phase studies during which key technologies such as CAD, CAM and FEM will be used collectively to design for optimal lattice micromorphology resulting in robust macroscale mechanical function.  Computationally meritorious scaffold structures will be fabricated using computer controlled fabrication methods and cellularized to screen cell response in the 3D environment.  <br/><br/>Non-Technical:  Tendon degeneration, particularly those associated with aging at the shoulder, is a widespread health problem that is affecting hundreds of thousands and imposing a substantial burden on the economy.  There is a lack of mechanically robust scaffolds to repair tendon, and most biomaterials are applied as reinforcement patches over the injured tendon.  The proposed pattern deposition technology presents a viable alternative as a 3D bioactive framework to regenerate tendons.  This carries the potential to improve the current treatment modalities.  The proposed research will also develop an enabling technology that can be extended to other tissues such as bone, ligament, liver, and vascular structures.  Patterned deposition of interconnected controlled pore space allows for enhanced mass-transport, creating the opportunity for engineering larger tissue volumes.  One of the merits of the proposed studies is understanding the relative roles of matrix anisotropy and matrix stiffness in inducing marrow-derived stem cells to become tendon cells in the absence of growth factors.  Achievement of differentiation by mechano-compositional cues is highly significant, because growth factors are expensive and heavily regulated.  The outreach component of the proposed project will foster undergraduate students' interests in scaffold design and fabrication through interdisciplinary senior design teams and research engagement.  Undergraduate students will be exposed to the emerging field of biofabrication by:  (a) accommodating one undergraduate student (full-time summer) for each year of the project, and (b) mentoring senior design teams on topics that map to the proposed activities. The emerging field of biofabrication is important in the new economy, and the proposed activities aim to inspire the innovators of the future."

A significant need for this technology exists in the competition horse market. 98% of competitive horses suffer from soft tissue injuries and more than 80% develop suspensory ligament defects. Injuries to suspensory ligaments can take years to heal and are the leading cause of missed performances owners. The proposed technology provides veterinarians a means of healing suspensory ligament injuries significantly faster, resulting in fewer missed performances, reduced financial losses, and most importantly, improved quality of life for the animal. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will address the problem of slow healing suspensory ligament injuries for racehorses. 98% of vets use stem cell injections to aid in recovery of these injuries, but this strategy has limited efficacy due to poor viability of injected cells and short cell retention times at the site of injury. This problem is addressed by developing technology to preserve and localize mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) at an injury site through delivery in inert, injectable hydrogel microparticles. The research objectives of this proposal are twofold; 1. Quantitively assessing metrics of cell viability and stromal cell-like behavior of hydrogel microencapsulated cells and compare them to baseline unencapsulated cell metrics, and 2. Provide explicit evidence that the encapsulation process localizes cells and preserves their viability, is nontoxic and non-immunogenic, and demonstrates markers of superior tissue regeneration in a small animal model similar to that of its intended commercial use. This study is expected to enable the quantitative elucidation of cell viability and biomolecular response to encapsulation in hydrogel microenvironments and establish preliminary safety and efficacy results of hydrogel-encapsulated MSCs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even though poor skeletal health is a major cause of injury and disability among aged individuals, the reason for reduced bone-building responsiveness to exercise in older individuals, compared to younger individuals, remains a knowledge gap. This project will quantify the mechanical forces that cells are subjected to in bone by using novel 3D printed tissue engineering constructs. Combining this technology with the aging conditions caused by microgravity in experiments to be conducted on the International Space Station will reveal the putative connections between aging and physical activity at the cellular level. Ultimately, these efforts may lead to non-pharmacologic, regenerative strategies to improve muscle and bone health in in older adults, in those who must undergo extended bedrest, and astronauts. The multidisciplinary approach taken in this bioengineering project will be an excellent platform to fascinate and engage the next generation of students and young scientists.<br/><br/>A major technical barrier in studying the mechanical environment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that reside within bone marrow is that there are no model systems currently available that can replicate the mechanical complexity of the bone marrow compartment. To close this gap, this work will develop a 3D printed bone marrow analog system that combines an in vivo environment with the accessibility of an in vitro culture system. This will permit a systematic approach of study. To study cellular mechanical environments within these marrow analogs, the approach will include an experimental setup and a complementary and validated finite element model. These mechanoactive marrow environments will provide a novel tool for mechanobiologists to systematically study the effect of the mechanical environment on cell responses in 3D. Utilization of this novel system in this project will specifically advance mechanobiology knowledge by: (1) quantifying the mechanoresponse of old MSCs in a young bone marrow geometry and vice versa, thereby identifying the contribution of mechanical stress environment to the mechanosignaling capacity of aged MSCs.

Transcription, the synthesis of RNA on the DNA template, is the first step in gene expression that largely defines which genes will be active. The key unanswered question is how transcription is regulated across the genome to generate stable, cell-type-specific patterns of gene expression. By combining classic biochemical approaches with global sequencing, this project will determine how specific transcription patterns may be stabilized by universal mechanisms targeting the enzymes responsible for RNA synthesis. By studying the process of transcription, the project will tackle a general problem of how multiple layers of information could be packed into, and extracted from, the same DNA sequence.<br/><br/>This project deals with the phenomenon of promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing, which occurs within the first 100 nucleotides of many metazoan genes and is controlled by factors involved in most if not all Pol II-transcribed promoters. Pausing is established by the Negative ELongation Factor (NELF) and, apart from the well-known productive elongation, can be alternatively released without mRNA synthesis via premature termination. This project will investigate the roles of factors responsible for pause establishment and release in human mesenchymal stem cells undergoing adipocyte differentiation. Objective 1 will focus on establishing pausing to determine how NELF defines genes to be paused. The question will be addressed by perturbing the levels of NELF at various time scales and monitoring Pol II pausing distribution and dynamics using our published as well as new methods including 5'-capped RNA- sequencing and multiplex permanganate footprinting. Objective 2 will focus on pause release to determine how the decision between mRNA production versus termination regulates expression of genes in response to a model heat shock stimulus. The question will be addressed by combining Pol II ChIP-sequencing and global run-on assays with novel analysis of termination-specific small RNAs derived from paused complexes. By exploring Pol II pausing as a prominent yet still poorly understood phenomenon, a new principle organizing genes into networks may be uncovered.

Engineered bone has the potential for providing treatment for bone defects without severe side effects.  This award supports a research collaboration with Dr. Ming-Huei Cheng at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taoyuan, Taipei to fabricate engineered bone for defects using a large animal model. The bone will be grown within a biomaterial to allow potential transplantation into patients. This will allow for treatment of bone defects without the need of autologous tissue. <br/><br/>Tissue engineering research is primarily focused on growth of tissue to repair or replace damaged or disease tissues and organs. Bone tissue engineering has gained significant attention due to the need for reconstruction of large bone volume defects. The current clinical treatment is reconstruction with autologous tissue, which has seen some success, however, is not without limitations. Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine often focus on biomaterial based strategies to promote vascularized tissue formation. One of the reasons why researchers are unable to grow clinically sized tissue volumes is the inability to sufficiently vascularized human sized scaffolds. Bone formation and vascularization is a dynamic, coordinated processes. Strategies that consider both processes have a greater chance of clinical success. Research has shown using hydrogel based scaffolds seeded with mesenchymal stem cells will improve tissue invasion that will lead to formation of osteogenic tissue. The goal of this proposal is to combine a hydrogel based scaffolds, with optimized pro-vascularization properties, with MSCSs to investigate bone formation in a pig rib-bone defect model. <br/><br/>This award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan."

Deterioration of islet health and function results in diabetes, which has become an epidemic healthcare problem worldwide. A promising treatment of diabetes lies in islet transplantation--where isolated islets from donors are transplanted into the patient. In the absence of sufficient islet donors, the current focus is on generating islets in the laboratory from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). Pancreatic islets primarily consist of hormone producing cells interlaced with a dense network of capillaries for efficient transport of released hormones. In addition to nutrient delivery, the islet vasculature plays a critical role in islet development and function.  Hence, when deriving islet-organoids from hPSCs, there will be multiple benefits in engineering the intra-islet vasculature, which is the objective of this project.  This objective will be achieved by integration of multiple novel techniques, including the aggregation of pancreatic cells into spheroids and the inclusion of microvessel fragments (MFs) obtained from adipose (fat) tissue to enhance vascularization. The most significant impact of the regenerative organoids will be in cell therapy for diabetes.  An even more achievable goal is the use of functional islet organoids as an in-vitro model for testing the efficacy and toxicity of drug compounds for diabetes.  The interdisciplinary faculty team, representing the University of Pittsburgh, Arizona State University and the University of Louisville, will leverage the multidisciplinary approach of this project to train students at the graduate and undergraduate levels and to broaden outreach programs to increase opportunities for a diverse population of students. The team will develop a joint summer internship program, where minority students from each institution will intern in the other two Universities, thereby enhancing collaborative opportunities as well as student training.<br/><br/>The goal of this collaborative project is to engineer in-vitro vascularized pancreatic islet organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs).  Self-organization of hPSCs will be engineered into heterogeneous three-dimensional (3D) constructs with a physiological islet vascular network and endocrine function. The team has developed a novel hydrogel system that closely mimics the 3D islet physiology through self-organization of hPSC derived pancreatic progenitor cells. The hydrogel platform enables precise control over the 3D culture configuration as well as allowing multicellular aggregation. This is a substantive departure from status quo, where hPSCs are randomly aggregated in a stirred suspension resulting in uncontrolled aggregates of varying size and phenotype.  In-vitro vascularization will be engineered by incorporating isolated adipose-derived microvessel fragments within the engineered 3D cellular construct. These microfragments retain the endothelial, vessel matrix components, and supporting cells necessary for angiogenesis. This pre-embedment and development of a vascular network is a substantive departure from status quo, where in-vivo implantation and host vasculature integration is relied upon for microvascular network formation. The project perhaps represents the first attempt to generate in-vitro vascularized pancreatic islet organoids from hPSCs.  The Research Plan is organized around three aims:  1) to determine culture conditions inducing aggregation of hPSC derived cells; 2) to induce islet-specific microvascular network within the islet organoids; and 3) to induce and characterize mature islet functionality (endocrine phenotype and glucose responsive insulin production) in the vascularized organoids in vitro and in vivo in an immunocompromised mouse model.  It is hypothesized that adequate reproduction of islet microenvironment within the organoid will induce islet-specific vascular characteristics and phenotype in the adipose-derived microvessels. Such regenerative islet organoids will be directly relevant for pancreatic tissue and organ engineering, and methods developed have the potential to transform the field of tissue engineering in general."

End-stage organ failure affects millions of people.  The current treatment is organ transplantation, which is severely limited by a shortage of donor organs.  Scientists have been trying to tissue-engineer organs outside of the body that can be used as replacements for failing organs, but these efforts have been challenged by the difficulty of creating networks of small blood vessels that can perfuse large pieces of tissue.  Studies have shown that when cells are given the freedom to organize and assemble themselves in low-gravity conditions called microgravity, they establish important cell-cell relationships and can form tissue structures such as capillary tubes.   In this research, using the liver as a model organ, the research team will investigate how microgravity conditions onboard the International Space Station may be used to facilitate development of a large, vascularized tissue graft.  The researchers hypothesize that a combination of factors, including the microgravity environment unique to the International Space Station, will produce a functional and vascularized liver tissue. The research results will include a time-lapse video of how the different cell types organize themselves in response to a growth factor gradient in microgravity.  This will allow investigators to better understand how microgravity regulates tissue formation.  In addition to the scientific objectives, the research team will raise public awareness of the potential benefits of biomedical research in space through efforts in K-12 education, mentoring groups underrepresented in S.T.E.M., public outreach, and industry partnership.<br/><br/>This project centers around two research goals. First, the microgravity environment of the ISS will be used to cerate a macroscopic, vascularized liver tissue.  The researchers hypothesize that the combination of an environment of 3D spatial freedom, a perfusion force within a central conduit that does not have to compete with the gravitational force, and sustained, directional angiogenic gradient will support the development of a functional, vascularized liver graft.  The liver organoids will be developed by co-culturing induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived hepatocytes with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).  The organoids will then be loaded into tissue culture vessels with a hollow fiber conduit to support the flow of blood and bile.  The physiological response of the tissue graft will be assessed to validate the model through both laboratory assays and xenotransplantation.  The second goal is to characterize the effect of microgravity and directional angiogenic gradients on 3D intercellular interactions and microvascular organization.  By using live-cell, time-lapse confocal microscopy, the effect of these environmental factors on the co-cultured cells of the organoids will be examined.  This portion of the project will advance fundamental understanding of how cells respond to a microgravity environment with respect to tissue self-assembly, which will support future work to advance the engineering of 3-dimensional tissue constructs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will use model organisms to understand how these cells function, as this process is conserved across species. The specific cells that will be examined are those that form the head and facial features, as any minor disruptions in this process can lead to a variety of birth defects, including cleft lip.

Movement is a complex process that involves the spatial and temporal control and integration of a number of sub-processes, including the transduction of chemical or mechanical signals from the environment, intra-cellular biochemical responses, and translation of the intra- and extracellular signals into a mechanical response. While many single-celled organisms use flagella or cilia to swim, there are two basic modes of movement used by eukaryotic cells that lack such structures -- mesenchymal and amoeboid. The former, which can be characterized as `crawling' or `gliding', involves the extension of finger-like protrusions and/or broad, flat protrusions, whose protrusion is driven by actin polymerization at the leading edge. The amoeboid mode is less reliant on strong adhesion, and cells are more rounded and employ shape changes to move -- in effect 'jostling through the crowd' or `swimming'. Cells of the immune system use this mode for movement through tissues when adhesion molecules have been knocked out. However, recent experiments have shown that numerous cell types display enormous plasticity in locomotion, in that they sense the mechanical properties of their environment and adjust their mode of movement accordingly. Thus pure crawling and pure swimming are the extremes on a continuum of locomotion strategies, but many cells can sense their environment to determine the most efficient strategy in a given environment.<br/><br/>The long-term objective in this research is to understand how cells sense the mechanical properties of their environment and transduce the information into intracellular biochemical and mechanical changes that determine their pattern of movement. Recent experimental work has discovered that numerous cell types use strong intracellular material flows near the cell wall, which, when disrupted, disrupts<br/>cell movement. However, there is as yet little understanding of how this flow translates into cell movement, and our first objective is to continue development and analysis of a mathematical model that facilitates in silico experiments to understand how the processes involved interact to produce motion. Another objective is to understand the cytoskeletal changes needed to produce motion using blebs, which are 'blister-like' protrusions of the membrane, and how the choice between blebs and other modes is arbitrated in complex environments. In particular, the role of membrane tension and the nature of cell confinement in determining how and where on the membrane blebs are initiated, and whether blebs or protrusions are used, are not understood. A third objective concerns movement of cells under various forms of confinement. It is known that imposed mechanical stress can induce movement in otherwise quiescent cells, but how mechanical stimuli induce motion is not understood. A detailed model such as the PI shall develop will provide experimentally-testable predictions that can be used to guide new experiments that advance our understanding of cell movement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cells can also actively generate forces, to probe and deform materials in their surrounding environment. These dynamic interactions between clusters of cells and their environment are critical to an immense range of activities including early development and cancer progression. In recent years there has been a growing interest to uncover what drives cells to escape from growing clusters, either independently or in collective streams. However, a thorough understanding of the biophysics governing such activity is lacking. To address these issues, a novel computational and experimental framework will be developed to investigate how the interplay between cellular forces, adhesion, and environmental physics drive cells to proliferate, escape, and invade distant regions of the body. The new tools proposed will impact many areas in biology, including normal and abnormal tissue development, wound healing, and tissue regeneration. The innovative mathematical models and methods will advance computing in biology as well as other fields of science such as bioengineering and biotechnology.<br/><br/>Current mathematical models cannot predict why cells invade from a proliferative cluster and migrate either independently or as collective strands, which determines the metastatic risk of invading cells during cancer progression. This problem will be addressed through a novel multi-scale framework that integrates computational models of highly non- linear matrix mechanics, force-mediated cell signaling, and active cell contractility. Such an approach will provide a new understanding of the mechanisms by which matrix properties promote or discourage cell invasion, and why cells tend to either move collectively or act alone. In particular, the critical role of cell-mediated matrix remodeling, long range force transmission, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) will be uncovered. The kinetics of cell invasion requires the formation of protrusions, assembly and dissolution of adhesions, and remodeling of contractile actomyosin fibers. These stochastic processes will be modelled using Kinetic Monte Carlo methods, that will explicitly account for fluctuations in the cell?s response to its environment. Additionally, a novel multi-scale bio-chemo-mechanical model of tissue growth will be developed to predict formation of arbitrarily shaped cell clusters and to quantify how complex patterns of cells emerge from such clusters. This research will lead to a paradigm shift in the mathematical modelling of cell invasion by explicitly including signalling, non-linear matrix mechanics and the two-way recursive dialog between cells and the matrix.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major bottleneck in EV biomanufacturing is scalability during development of a product to achieve clinically relevant doses. Current practices rely on invasive manipulations of cells and culture conditions, which can have deleterious implications on the final product and can incur high cost and operate at small scales, making them less viable for best-practice manufacturing. This project will improve EV production through noninvasive mechanical stimulation of MSCs by delivering low magnitude mechanical signals to MSCs cultured in two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. This project will identify cellular responses to biophysical modulations and evaluate improvements to overall secretome, EV production, and functionality. The project will not only add new fundamental knowledge on mechanotransduction in MSCs behind EV release, but also provide functional evidence for overcoming large-scale manufacturing challenges in EV production. Students from underrepresented populations will engage in research; this will help train and develop a strong and diverse future biomanufacturing workforce, together having wide-reaching impacts on education, science and engineering, and the U.S economy. This Future Manufacturing award is supported by the following Division/Programs and Offices: ENG/CBET, MPS/CHE, MPS/DMR, EHR/DUE, and OIA/EPSCoR.<br/><br/>Strategies to improve EV production include hypoxic culture conditions, serum starvation, and immortalization of MSCs ? all of which have deleterious implications in cell integrity and functionality and operate at small scales, thus necessitating development of feasible methods to enhance manufacturing. This project is based on the scientific premise that MSCs are mechanosensitive cells responding to mechanical stimuli.  The central hypothesis is that delivery of mechanical cues/forces in the form of low-magnitude mechanical stimulation (LMMS) to MSCs can affect (i) cell membrane integrin-cytoskeletal interactions that regulate actin dynamics and vesicle transport, and (ii) alter intracellular calcium levels leading to consequential release of EVs. The project harnesses the mechanotransduction of external forces on actin via integrins/talin, and subsequent influence on EV machinery towards the overall improvement in EV secretion by MSCs. Based on preliminary evidence that mechanical signals increase overall MSC secretome and EV concentration, this Future Manufacturing project will investigate the mechanisms behind mechanically triggered EV release, and will determine qualitative and functional improvements in EVs secreted in response to mechanical stimulation. The project will establish a minimally manipulative biophysical method to scale-up manufacturing of EVs from MSCs through delivery of low magnitude mechanical vibrations. The three major objectives are (1) To evaluate the effects of LMMS-based biophysical cell modulation system on EV release and unravel underlying mechanotransduction changes in MSCs in response to LMMS; (2) To assess functional potency of LMMS-induced EVs for immunosuppression (in vitro) and tissue regeneration (in vivo) in a critical-sized calvarial defect model; and (3) Leverage research outcomes to support education and development of a skilled technical workforce in the state of Arkansas by engaging undergraduate, graduate, and middle school students in biomanufacturing education and research. The project will benefit the field of life sciences, manufacturing and bioengineering education and research, contributing to sustained U.S. competitiveness in EV biomanufacturing for research and therapy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The behavioral responses of cells to three-dimensional (3D) micromechanical environments are of special interest in recent years because the environments of cells in vivo are 3D in nature. 3D micromechanical environments are much more challenging to design, fabricate, characterize, and apply for fruitful cell studies and applications compared with the corresponding two-dimensional (2D) ones. The curvature of a 3D substrate on which a cell will be growing is one of the major geometrical parameters of this substrate, and therefore, creating curvature-defined 3D cell culture substrates is crucial for 3D cell mechanobiology and bioengineering. This team has invented a first-ever unique and powerful class of 3D curvature-defined cell culture substrates - micro glass ball embedded gels. This technology opens up countless opportunities for the field of cell and tissue engineering and its biomedical applications. The objective of this NSF I-Corps Teams project is to start the process to promote and commercialize this newly-invented and patented technology.<br/><br/>The class of cell culture substrates, micro glass ball embedded gels, introduced in this NSF I-Corps Teams project provides a unique and useful tool for studying cell and tissue mechanobiological responses to substrate curvatures and local stiffness, and for other related cell and tissue engineering researches and biomedical applications. Specifically, this technology provides the first-ever cell culture substrates with defined curvatures. The effect of substrate curvature is one of the fundamental aspects in the currently cutting-edge and very hot area of research: cell and tissue mechanobiology and bioengineering. This technology also provides the first-ever cell culture substrates with defined nanometer to micrometer scale stiffness patterns. These substrates and the similar ones prepared/fabricated by the same strategy can be used in or extended to any other studies involving micro- and nanocomposites and interfacial phenomena. The method, introduced in this project, to prepare/fabricate micro glass ball embedded gels, opens a new strategy and is transformative for micro- and nanofabrication of even or uneven regular or irregular shaped (substrate) surfaces or arrays or patterns or composites."

Autoimmune diseases are the number one cause of morbidity for women in the U.S., and one of the top 10 causes of death for women under 65 years old. The annual healthcare burden of these diseases is estimated at more than $100 billion in the U.S. alone. Current treatments for autoimmune diseases are effective for some patients, but a majority either do not respond or become refractory. Furthermore, standard drugs result in systemic immune suppression, which can cause severe and chronic side effects. Hence, there is substantial market need for anti-inflammatory drugs that can act locally at the site of inflammation, and deliver the ""right dose at the right time"" depending on the severity of the flare.

The goal is to design and optimize synthetic gene circuits to program cells to locally sense inflammatory signals such as TNFalpha and release anti-TNF drugs. The plan is to introduce these circuits into adult stem cells that have been used safely in numerous clinical trials against autoimmune diseases and have a well-established commercial development path. The engineered cells will be tested in culture to show input/output response to different levels of TNFalpha, and then tested in mouse models of disease.

Currently, the production of biological molecules for human therapies is largely based on a non-standardized design of experiments that are often time consuming, labor intensive and expensive. This project develops an in-vitro / in-silico platform that standardizes the production process design following a specific framework, applicable to a wide variety of producer cell and product combinations. The in-silico mathematical model allows to explore the whole design space reducing the number of in-vitro experiments and the labor burden, and to apply model-based optimization techniques to select the best production conditions for new drugs. The acceleration of the process design has significant impact on reducing time-to-market for drugs that are needed in the market as soon as possible, for example for FDA fast track approval candidates. Additionally, the capital and operational cost reductions can help new biomanufacturers to make their businesses technically and economically feasible.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project responds to the need for novel biomanufacturing approaches, including Quality by Design (QbD) principles and Process Analytical Technologies (PAT), which allow fast and effective process development platforms that ensure consistent product quality and reduced lot-to-lot variability. This platform incorporates QbD and uses PATs. The central component of the tool is a mathematical model that predicts dynamic nutrient uptake based on biochemical reaction networks, to quantify and characterize cell metabolism. The in-vitro component of the platform collects critical information to determine cell type/product/clone-specific parameters. These parameters give high predictive capability to the mathematical model to determine the specific media composition and feeding strategy to optimize the volumetric productivity of cell cultures producing biomolecules for human therapies. The precision of the media composition and feeding strategy reduces raw materials and operational cost, the increased volumetric productivity reduces equipment size and capital cost, and the capability to feed the exact nutrients demand for cell proliferation, maintenance and production, ensures product quality. This bioprocess optimizer represents a flexible and efficient tool that transforms, improves and accelerates conventional process development in biomanufacturing with wide applications, including biologics, cell therapies and gene therapies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two major technical hurdles in the regenerative medicine field have prevented the translation of cell therapy from the bench to the bedside, despite the huge surge in clinical trials being conducted worldwide: 1) The lack of devices for the isolation of native clinically active bone marrow or cord blood derived cells without gradient selection and centrifugation that lead to cell loss and decreased cell viability; and 2) The logistical hurdles of cell isolation and processing in ""centralized"" cell production facilities. The prevalent approaches involve the collection of patient tissues such as bone marrow samples at hospitals, transport of samples to the central cell production facilities, isolation and expansion of cells using different protocols, and transporting the cell product back to the hospital sites for transplantation into patients. Every step of this cell therapy and transplantation process is expensive, involves multiple teams and poses a potential risk for introducing contamination, cellular loss and other complications. The technology proposed in this project is incorporated in a device that has the potential to overcome these two hurdles. The device allows the derivation of adherent bone marrow cells (ABMCs) that are native or minimally manipulated, in a GMP-compliant process for isolation and delivery of cells for cell therapy applications in hospitals and outpatient clinics, thereby circumventing transportation requirement and central facility processing and making cell therapy more widely available. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to overcome the hurdles in the regenerative medicine field by developing a device that enables GMP-grade stem cell processing in a functionally closed system.

While the ultimate goal is to conduct IND enabling studies, this Phase I grant objectives covers: 1) GMP-compliant coating of the device surface with matrix molecules and validation for efficient collection of ABMCs, 2) Post processing validation of ABMC sample integrity. Since the device also has a provision component for freezing of the processed samples, objective 3) is to validate ABMC freezing and cell recovery. Safety assays will include sterility and end product monitoring. Non-retrospective flow cytometry assays will be utilized to analyze CD34, CD44, CD45, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD106, CD166, and CD271 expression, essential markers that distinguish ABMCs. Higher percentages of CD106 and CD271 are expected for ABMCs. The potential for CFU-F formation, along with adipogenic, osteogenic and neuronal potentials of ABMCs will be examined and compared with standard mesenchymal stem cells.

One strategy to help wound healing is to implant a hydrogel containing isolated hMSCs directly into the wound site.  The hydrogel provides structural integrity to the surrounding tissue.  However, during wound healing, hMSCs remodel and degrade the hydrogel over time.  These processes must be better understood to design hydrogels with the optimal properties for wound healing. This CAREER project will apply a combination of new and existing methods to characterize the region around cells during cell remodeling and degradation of the synthetic hydrogel material. The goal of the combined research and education effort is to: (1) use a novel interdisciplinary approach to provide new techniques to answer a critical problem in biomaterials and cell biology, (2) recruit and train a diverse work force and (3) educate a broad audience in biomaterials, materials characterization, and wound healing. The research will have a major impact on biomaterials design. These new materials have the potential to increase the rate of wound healing and prevent development of chronic wounds. In addition, the principle investigator will recruit, train and educate a broad audience. This will be done by: (i) outreach to the public at the Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown, PA, (ii) mentoring of middle and high school students and (iii) mentoring and training of undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this work is to characterize the spatial and temporal rheological evolution of a synthetic hydrogel during cell-mediated degradation to determine viability as an implantable wound healing scaffold. The physical microenvironment is hypothesized to control hMSC degradation strategies during cell migration to efficiently deliver hMSCs to the wound and control material degradation. To test this, the research includes a) characterizing hMSC degradation strategies in homogenous hydrogels that mimic the stiffness of native tissues, b) determining the change in response to an interface in stiffness, and c) determining how gradients in scaffold stiffness change hMSC-mediated degradation and direct motility to increase cell delivery and material integrity. hMSCs will be encapsulated in 3D in a well-established photopolymerizable poly(ethylene glycol)-peptide hydrogel. The peptide cross-linker in this material is degraded by cell-secreted enzymes. Dynamic scaffold properties will be measured with bulk rheology and microrheology. Multiple particle tracking microrheology (MPT) will measure the spatio-temporal degradation profile created in the scaffold by encapsulated hMSCs. These measurements will determine the unique degradation strategies hMSCs use in response to changes in their microenvironment. Bulk rheology will quantify the change in material integrity as hMSCs permanently degrade the synthetic scaffold. Using this knowledge, the viability of these materials as implantable wound healing scaffolds and the microenvironments that most efficiently deliver hMSCs to an injury while providing structure to the surrounding tissue will be determined. The research outcomes will be: i) identification of the microenvironment cells engineer during motility in response to homogeneous and heterogeneous environments in the scaffold and ii) determination of microenvironments that increase cell delivery and material integrity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current approaches to treat bone defects include autografts and allografts that are associated with limitations such as shortage of donors and risk of disease transmission. Strategies built on tissue engineering offer alternative approaches to repair and regenerate tissues. The transfer of tissue engineering methodology from the lab to the clinic is limited by the failure to adequately vascularize scaffolds following implantation. The goal of this project is to promote the neogenesis of bone and supporting vasculature in a synchronized manner similar to the physiological process of bone growth during maturation. The project is transformative in nature in that contrary to conventional methods, instead of trying to counteract inflammation, the proposed approach establishes the proof of principle for the use of resveratrol, a natural polyphenol, to regulate immune cell behavior and use their secreted signaling molecules to drive vasculogenesis and bone formation. The approach involves the use of (i) a resveratrol, a natural polyphenol found commonly in grapes and berries, (ii) a biomimetic scaffold with native bone extracellular matrix protein components, and (iii) mesenchymal stem cells. Rapid perfusion throughout an implanted scaffold is a critical issue for engineering the repair of a wide variety of tissues in addition to bone. The study delineate the potential of resveratrol as a potent physiological cue to control inflammatory response with many applications beyond the fields of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (e.g. tumor inflammation). The educational goals include development of an elective course on principles of stem cells engineering and promoting participation of students from underrepresented groups in the field of biomedical engineering."

Extensive efforts have been made in osteochondral defect treatment, but there is still no widely accepted method which produces consistent satisfactory results. The regenerated cartilage is inferior to the original cartilage morphologically, biochemically, and biomechanically. Instead of forming articular cartilage, fibrocartilage is normally generated, which lacks of the long-term stability and cannot withstand prolonged stress to the joint. Thus, there is a need for a new approach that outperforms currently used methods. In this study, we propose to develop a graded scaffold with structure and mechanical properties mimicking those of natural cartilage, load the scaffold with articular-specific chondroprogenitor cells identified by GFP reporters, and then implant the cell-loaded scaffold into a novel transgenic mouse cartilage model to test for osteochondral repair and regeneration. It is expected that an optimum cell-scaffold construct will be determined which effectively regenerates osteochondral cartilage with excellent functionality and long-term stability.<br/><br/>Intellectual merits: The novelty of the current proposal includes: (1) the development of a graded scaffold with structure, orientation, composition and mechanical properties mimicking those of natural cartilage and subchondral bone; (2) the development of an in-depth understanding of chondrocytes differentiation pathways and establishment of their lineage interrelationships; (3) the identification of articular-specific chondroprogenitor cells using a series of cartilage GFP reporters; (4) the development of an informative transgenic murine cartilage model to assess osteochondral repair and its integration with host tissues at a relatively low cost.<br/><br/>Broader impact: The proposed project has a broader impact on various scientific disciplines. The results of the proposed research will contribute to our understanding of the cell-scaffold interactions, chondrocyte differentiation pathways, and host/donor cell contribution to the articular cartilage restoration for the first time. The information gained here will be an essential ingredient in developing and interpreting tissue engineering strategies to determine the optimal scaffold design and source of progenitors, and whether a repair process is initiated from the host or donor. Distinguishing the completeness of the repair in terms of the composition of cells that fill the repair region will be another measure of success of a repair strategy. The proposed research will be transformative to the tissue engineering field as it directly addresses the existing problems of the osteochondral cartilage repair and its approach may provide an effect solution to these problems.<br/><br/>This project will result in the training of a graduate student and a number of undergraduate students in areas of tissue engineering, while exposing them to a multidisciplinary working environment. Efforts will be made to recruit female and minority students by integrating our research activities with existing recruiting efforts at the Department, the School and the University levels as well as participating in activities organized by various professional societies dedicated to underrepresented minorities. In addition, we will perform K-12 outreach to get high school students, especially female and underrepresented minorities, excited about engineering research. The results obtained from the project will be disseminated broadly via publishing in scientific journals, presenting in conferences and publicizing to general public via a website. We will make sure that all data will be kept for at least three years after conclusion of the award or three years after public release, whichever is later. We will also make our transgenic mice available to the tissue engineering community so that more researchers can use them to optimize their repair strategies."

Patients typically survive only 12-15 months after their initial diagnosis. Therefore, new treatments for GBM are urgently needed. However, finding new therapies for GBM has been challenging, largely due to the lack of models that adequately mimic the patient?s condition, which is particularly important since the disease is highly heterogeneous. That is, tumors differ widely in their pathological features and respond differently to treatments.  To address these issues, this project will develop ""GBM organoids,"" which are three-dimension masses of cells that mimic the behavior of miniature GBM tumors.  These organoids will be manufactured using GBM stem cells (specialized GBM cells that give rise to all types of cells in a GBM tumor) derived directly from patients.  Cells will be positioned using 3D printers and cultured in bioreactors.  The potential long-term outcomes of such biomanufactured organoids are reduced reliance on animal models for cancer research and a framework for suggesting novel treatments for GBM patients in the future. This project will also provide research and educational opportunities to underrepresented minority undergraduate and graduate students. International opportunities are planned that integrate the research results into summer study-abroad courses in order to help prepare the next generation of more globally competent engineers.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop GBM (glioblastoma) organoids that retain three main features of GBM tumors: intertumoral heterogeneity (i.e., molecular subtypes), intratumoral heterogeneity (i.e., cells in the inner/necrotic core exhibiting very different characteristics to those at the tumor periphery), and cancer stem cells (CSCs).  The goal will be achieved by creating GBM organoids that are homogeneous in size but retain in vivo-like intratumoral heterogeneity by using GBM CSCs. The Research Plan, designed to demonstrate that the project?s bioreactor-cultured GBM organoids can recapitulate the innate tumor microenvironment, is organized under three aims, each motivated by a scientific hypothesis. The FIRST Aim is to reproducibly biomanufacture GBM organoids in bioreactors.  Subaims are to:  a) demonstrate that sublethal fluid shear improves homogenous production of GBM organoids and b) elucidate the role of shear-induced EpCAM (Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule)-positive EVs (extracellular vessels) in organoid production.  Results obtained will be used to test the hypothesis that sublethal shear stress in stirred-tanks leads to GBM organoid production via EpCAM-positive extracellular vesicles (EVs). The SECOND Aim is to produce GBM organoids with perivascular niche-like ECM (extracellular matrix) and microvessels.  Subaims are to: a) demonstrate that GSCs in hyaluronic acid (HA)-rich conditions generate CD31+microvessel-like cells within GBM organoids; b) generate GBM organoids with 3D-printed HA hydrogels; c) produce GBM organoids with co-cultured microvessels and d) demonstrate  that pathological features of PDX (Patient-derived xenograft) tissues are recapitulated in biomanufactured organoids.  Results obtained will be used to test the hypothesis that tumor tissue-like angiogenesis by GSCs occurs when organoids are >500 ?m diameter.  The THIRD Aim is to profile the genetic composition and chemotherapy sensitivity of biomanufactured GBM organoids.  Subaims are to: a) profile the patient-specific genetic subtypes (proneural (PN), neural (N), classical (C), and mesenchymal (M)) of biomanufactured organoids and b) characterize organoids? responses to chemotherapeutic drugs TMZ (temozolomide) and SAL(salinomycin).  Results obtained will be used to test the hypothesis that pathologically relevant organoids recapitulate the intratumoral and intertumoral diversity found in tumor tissues, and thus, can serve as better in vitro models for drug response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recombinant (artificially produced) proteins can be used as an alternative to grafts, but they are expensive and have potential adverse side effects. In collaboration with researchers in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, this research will develop innovative gene-activated materials that encourage the body's own cells to produce the proteins needed for bone tissue repair. This will advance the nation's health and promote the progress of science by developing material systems that can be used to promote the healing of many tissues in the body, in addition to bone. The educational outreach component of this proposal will help students understand how biological materials behave mechanically and how this knowledge can be used to develop replacement materials for clinical use. Interactive STEM research kits will be developed for middle and high school students to enhance understanding of the measurement techniques used to quantify mechanical behavior of biological materials, including bone and synthetic materials used to replace biological materials clinically.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to design a materials-based approach for the controlled delivery of novel osteoanabolic genetic cargos using non-viral vectors combined with osteoconductive scaffolds to promote healing of large bone defects. To achieve this goal, a hybrid material system will be designed and validated; the system will consist of a peptide vector to deliver genetic cargo and a collagen/hydroxyapatite scaffold to present the genetic cargo to cells in the healing space and provide osteoconductive surfaces. The material system will be validated by assessing its ability to promote bone formation activity in vitro and bone healing in vivo. The novel therapeutic genetic cargos for local delivery are parathyroid hormone (PTH), microRNA 26A mimic (miR-26a), and an inhibitor to microRNA133a (antagomiR-133a). The RALA peptide is a non-viral vector that will be used to deliver the therapeutic cargos using a collagen-based scaffold designed specifically for bone repair. The efficacy of the gene activated scaffolds at promoting osteoanabolic activity in mesenchymal stem cells in vitro will be evaluated by quantifying gene expression of key osteogenic and angiogenic markers. The safety of the gene-activated scaffolds will be evaluated in vivo by assessing the distribution of the genetic cargos in tissues and organs. The efficacy will be evaluated by quantifying bone formation in a critical size femoral defect using micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each part of the immune system is influenced to some extent by the aging process. However, adaptive immunity, the immunity that allows us to eliminate disease producing agents (pathogens) or prevent their growth, seems more extensively affected.  As a result, there is increased susceptibility to infection, poor responses to vaccination, and increased incidence of autoreactivity (immune responses directed against the body's own tissues). It is not known exactly what causes these observed changes, but an understanding of the possible causes is now beginning to emerge. Many space-related physiological changes resemble those observed during aging. However, following microgravity exposure, such changes are more or less quickly restored after re-entry to Earth. This project aims to investigate the relationship between an individual's immune aging and healing outcomes, and to investigate the biology of aging from two directions--not only during its development in microgravity conditions but also during recovery. Designed to work like human organs, tissue chips mimic living human tissues and cells. The investigators will use a tissue chip design that enables them to explore the relationship between liver aging and regeneration and immune responses and to look for possible ways to slow the aging process and enhance the liver healing process. Each immune system chip includes two types of cells: a specific type of immune cell and liver cells, which interact with the immune cells. By sending the chips into space, the investigators will be able simulate the aging process of the immune system and understand how it affects our liver's ability to repair itself as we grow older. This research is expected to provide new insights into the molecular basis for many human conditions, which in this particular project relates to how microgravity induces aging of the immune system that may lead to the development of novel therapies here on Earth. In tandem with the scientific objectives, the project will work with the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkley to summarize how cell chips are plated and document each step of the space experience: from launch, to storage on the International Space Station (ISS), until sample return. The results and the concept of cellular engineering will be disseminated to a broad audience through a suite of new online resources.  The education goals include attracting students to the many STEM disciplines by engaging them with cutting-edge investigations on age-old, fascinating questions that include extending the human lifespan, and possible long-term human existence elsewhere beyond Earth and strengthening educators' and the public's support of this and other NSF-funded research by drawing in and connecting not only educators and students, but the general public to exciting medical research taking place aboard the ISS.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research thrust is to gain a better understanding of the influence of immunosenescence, the dysregulation of the body's immune response, which is associated with aging. Adaptive immunity seems particularly affected by the increase in the frequency of terminally differentiated CD8+ effector memory T (TEMRA) cells, which is driven by chronic antigen exposure and correlates with aging.  Many space-related physiological changes resemble those observed during aging but are restored after re-entry.  The investigators have already demonstrated that simulated microgravity induces the differentiation of T cells into TEMRA cells that impact the repair capacity of mesenchymal stem cells and epithelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in wound healing and tube formation, respectively. The focus of this project is to gain a better understanding of the influence of immunosenescence on the regenerative capacity of liver-specific stem cells.  All experiments will utilize liver tissue mimics (in vitro 3D-co-cultures of CD8+ T cells and Liver Progenitor Cells (LPCs)) on tissue chips. Ultimately, the chips will be placed in the ISS for up to a month, where microgravity will serve as the aging model.  The Research Plan is organized under two objectives.  The First Objective is to study the effect of aged CD8+ T cells for liver progenitor cells behavior, plasticity, and repair capacity in space and to assess the relationship between an individual's immune reactivity and healing.  For these studies, after the month in space, the chips will be fixed/frozen for subsequent post-flight analysis.  The Second Objective is to investigate post-flight recovery of tissue chips using functional analysis.  For these studies, after the month in space, the chips will be returned live from space for post-flight analysis as the microgravity aged tissues recover. The combined objectives enable investigation of the biology of aging--not only its development but also its reversal. The data obtained are expected to provide important insights into the influence of T cell aging on liver stem cells and subsequent liver healing and regeneration that will lead to a new treatment paradigm for future use in patients with age-associated alteration in the liver. (Project integration and operation on the ISS will be provided by the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) implementation partner, BioServe.)<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, cell behavior on such surfaces significantly deviate from their in vivo counterparts. There is a pressing need to incorporate the ECM characteristics into stem cell culture technologies. The goal of this research is to advance next-generation cell culture technologies by investigating nanotopographical memory effects of stem cells.<br/><br/>ECM/substrate nanotopography and stiffness critically influence numerous developmental, physiological and pathological processes in vivo, and have a profound influence on cell behavior and stem cell fate decision in vitro.  It is hypothesized that stem cells can retain nanotopographical information from past culture environments and the nanotopographical memory can influence future fate decision of stem cells. The objective of the proposed research is to test this hypothesis and to delineate the underlying mechanism of nanotopographical memory effects. Three research objectives using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) as model cells are proposed to study the nanotopographical memory effects: (1) Regulate Yes-associated protein (YAP) intracellular localization by using nanotopography, (2) Validate nanotopographical memory effects, and (3) Delineate the underlying mechanism of nanotopographical memory effects. This research will advance the understanding of cellular mechanotransduction and stem cell plasticity during developmental and pathological processes. It will call attention to unintended nanotopographical memory effects during in vitro culture, which may affect stem cell function and differentiation. This research will contribute to the development of next-generation stem cell culture technologies, and provide insight into the design of new biomaterials and the cell-substrate interfaces of implants and medical devices for regenerative medicine.

This question is central to synthesis of functional tissue in vitro and in vivo. Stem and progenitor cells, defined in part by the ability to adopt several distinct phenotypes under environmental cues, are particularly advantageous targets of this engineered function. Current limitations are due in part to our poor understanding of the general mechanisms by which cells respond dynamically to the environment. The capacity to assess cell phenotype through cell surface characteristics is critical to the engineering of environments that will guide cell function, particularly in mechanically responsive systems such as the vasculature. Thus, the objective of this research is to develop a chemomechanical approach to map the real-time changes in the surface of individual (1) vascular endothelial and (2) adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells using an advanced technique of scanning probe microscopy, termed functionalized force imaging (FFI). Sequential image acquisition will enable real-time, in vitro analysis of ligand-binding kinetics and cell response. The capacity to identify and quantify in real-time the molecular basis of cell surface environment interaction mechanisms within individual living cells will provide a new means by which cells present in low frequency can be identified, isolated, and analyzed in response to environmental stimuli.

Studies will also investigate the genes that control a key migratory behavior exhibited by these mesodermal cells. This behavior is exhibited by many different cell types, including cancer cells when they undergo metastasis.

This will allow students and teachers access to models to better appreciate complex developmental processes, and will foster interdisciplinary interactions between the fields of biology, information technology and engineering. Finally, as this research will involve undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, it will provide valuable opportunities to train future generations of scientists and teachers.<br/><br/>This project examines fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate mesoderm formation in a model spiralian, the gastropod Crepidula. In addition to the widely conserved endomesoderm, spiralians have a second novel source of mesoderm (ectomesoderm) that may be tied to the origin of larval body plans in this clade. Unlike endomesoderm, ectomesoderm undergoes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the formation of ectomesoderm are poorly understood. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) have not been constructed for either endo- or ectomesoderm in any spiralian. This project has two specific aims: I. Determine cellular mechanisms that regulate ectomesoderm formation and II. Determine molecular mechanisms that regulate development of spiralian endo- and ectomesoderm. Experiments in Aim I will determine the role of cell-cell interactions vs. cell autonomous factors in regulating ectomesoderm formation by combining lineage tracing, laser cell ablation and fluorescence time-lapse imaging. In Aim II, a combination of gene expression analyses and molecular loss-of-function assays will decipher endo- and ectomesoderm GRNs. Comparisons of these GRNs will validate hypotheses regarding the evolutionary origins of endo- and ectomesoderm. This research may uncover novel interactions between genes regulating mesoderm formation and those involved in EMT. Comparisons with previous studies in other systems will provide a better understanding of gastrulation and body plan evolution amongst the Metazoa. This research will involve undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students to provide valuable opportunities to train future scientists and teachers, and will generate valuable reagents and resources for the scientific community. Finally, imaging data will be disseminated through open-access websites to permit 3D printing of physical models of various stages of development, so anyone with access to a 3D printer can create models to appreciate the process of morphogenesis in these embryos.

These procedures arise from treatment of traumatic injury, congenital defects, tumor resection, and joint replacements. Bone fractures comprise a majority of these disorders with 6.2 million fractures. However, it is estimated that up to 10 percent of these bone defects are associated with improper healing. Without the aid of a bone graft material, these defects result in low structural integrity and potentially result in amputation. The gold standard of treatment relies on using bone from the patient as a graft. The technology under developed by this project, extracellular matrix derived from osteogenic stem cells, offers a bone graft material with equivalent healing properties to a patient's bone graft without the potential chronic pain and risk of infection associated with the harvesting a bone graft. From a scientific perspective, this project represents a disruptive change to all cell-derived matrix technologies, and as a result has the potential to drive innovative tissue engineering-based solutions to regenerate other tissues.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project aims to generate an osteogenic bone graft material derived from cultured mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). The technology coaxes hMSCs to differentiate into an intermediate osteogenic phenotype that can be used generate extracellular matrix that mimics the primitive stroma deposited during embryological bone development and during bone repair in adults. When purified from the cells, this material exhibits remarkable biocompatibility and significantly increases retention of engrafted hMSCs, with far greater binding capacity than commonly employed bone substitutes. Importantly, these properties accelerate bone repair and spinal fusion in animal models. Methods have been developed to produce and harvest this matrix from hMSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells that can be theoretically expanded indefinitely, hence it is possible to now produce large amounts of osteogenic matrix with reliable properties. Further, these cells are actually able to produce matrix in much higher quantities than that produced by bone marrow-derived hMSCs. This is a platform technology to harvest and combine this matrix with surgical collagen sponge or other suitable scaffolds as a replacement for currently used allogenic scaffolds."

Current clinical treatments for cartilage defects can temporarily restore joint function. However, these methods fail to treat the chronic inflammatory cycle that contributes to tissue degeneration associated with osteoarthritis. A tissue engineering scaffold will be developed that not only restores the function of locally damaged cartilage but also provides for the sustained release of anti-inflammatory molecules into the surrounding lubricating synovial fluid as the scaffold degrades. Toward this goal, the PI will further develop a unique family of biomaterials derived from a natural building block produced by yeast cells that consists of fatty acid and sugar residues. The polymers, prepared by a ""green chemistry"" approach, will be tuned so that they have the required biological properties needed for the tissue engineering scaffold. Furthermore, after the biomaterial performs its function, it will hydrolytically degrade to safe molecules. Ph.D., undergraduate and high school students participating in this program will gain critically important skills in modern organic and polymer synthesis, biocatalysis, cell-biology methods and in the fabrication of biomaterials into desired forms. Students will work in teams, learn critical communication skills and will develop a deep appreciation for interdisciplinary research problems. <br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The proposed research seeks to develop a tissue engineering strategy to repair cartilage defects associated with osteoarthritis while also treating chronic inflammation which often propagates joint deterioration. Objectives in the proposed studies are to: 1) develop a library of glycopolymers synthesized by the ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of a yeast produced lactonic glycolipid that is decorated with a range of specific chemical moieties that are known to be chondrogenic and/or anti-inflammatory, 2) generate and characterize porous glycopolymer biomaterial scaffolds and 3) evaluate through in vitro investigations the chondrogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of these scaffolds to identify scaffolds warranting future in vivo evaluation. A key strategy in this work is the use of lactonic sophorolipids (LSLs) as building blocks since they are easily produced by fermentations in high yields (>300 g/L). Furthermore, LSLs are amenable to a wide range of selective modification reactions both prior to or after polymerization that provides a platform for bioresorbable biomaterials whose structure and, therefore, functional properties, can be ""tuned"" as required. High school, undergraduate and Ph.D. students will be organized into teams in order to: i) provide mentoring opportunities between students at different levels and ii) to simulate today's workplace that increasingly utilizes interdisciplinary teams to solve complex problems. In this way, students in the program will gain an understanding and appreciation of high-level teamwork and communication between disciplines."

Using poorly defined, mixed populations of cells will result in unsatisfactory outcomes, regardless of the downstream technologies. Purification or enrichment of high-value material, like adult stem cells, is necessary for a broad range of existing and future therapeutic strategies. By better controlling the composition of the source population of cells, the performance of regenerative therapies and products is hypothesized to be more reproducible, making biomanufacturing approaches more feasible than they are today. Current enrichment techniques, which depend on the existence of unique combinations of cell surface proteins, are limited by very low cell yields and significant susceptibility to donor variability.  In this work, the investigators propose to develop and evaluate new procedures that enable the production of stem cell populations with consistent regenerative characteristics, independent of donor.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this proposal is to rapidly isolate primary, mesenchymal stem cells and enrich for subpopulations capable of regeneration using an innovative cell separation device in conjunction with gene expression-based enrichment. This project will be a collaboration among researchers at Brown University, Rhode Island Hospital, and Endocellutions, Inc. To achieve this goal, a live-cell molecular beacon will be designed that fluorescently identifies cells capable of adipogenic gene expression. Human fat tissue will be obtained using the Adi-Cellutions device, and cells within the solid/liquid fractions of the isolate will be examined for their regenerative characteristics following gene expression-based sorting. Two specific aims are included in this proposal: 1) Investigate how gene expression-based cell sorting parameters influence high-yield acquisition of adipogenic cells, and 2) Establish a set of processing parameters capable of generating consistent regenerative characteristics in isolated cell populations, independent of donor. Gene expression-based cell enrichment is a potential, paradigm-shifting technique, vastly expanding the potential targets researchers can investigate beyond current, cell surface marker approaches. More practically, the methodologies generated from this project will provide a roadmap for other investigators to obtain more consistent populations of cells for use in basic science experiments as well as clinical procedures. The proposed academic-industry collaboration will result in contributions to the fields of biomedical engineering, cell and molecular biology, and clinical medicine. Undergraduate, graduate, and medical students will participate throughout all stages of the proposed project, and experimental findings will be distributed through scientific communications and educational venues at Brown University and partnering hospitals."

In a subset of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-small cell lung cancer with specific mutations, these therapies lead to dramatic clinical responses in a significant proportion of patients. However, in the majority of AML and subset of lung cancer patients who respond to anti-cancer therapies, therapeutic relapse subsequently ensues, although often after a considerable interval, such that these responses do not lead to long-term cures. In this project the PIs will use theoretical physics and mathematical modeling approaches to investigate the process of response to treatment, the basis for persistence of a subset of cells during clinical response, and the mechanisms driving subsequent therapeutic relapse in these two tumor types. This integrative approach will involve genomic, transcriptional, and phenotypic assays of tumors at the various stages of therapeutic response and resistance. As such, this project is expected to lead to a more fundamental understanding of the evolution of drug resistance and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed to prevent the emergence of clinical resistance. Although the efforts in this project will focus on lung cancer and AML, the results and approaches described herein will have broader relevance to oncology and are aimed to uncover general principles and models, which are relevant to the spectrum of human cancers. <br/><br/>The integrative approach in this project will lead to major advances in the understanding of the genetic and epigenetic evolution of cancer. The studies into the genetic and mechanistic basis for therapeutic relapse, and the detailed genetic, epigenetic, and functional studies of EGFR mutant lung cancer and AML patient samples before therapy, at the time of maximal clinical response, and at disease relapse will allow the PIs to obtain detailed datasets from DNA sequencing and gene expression profiling to probe the dynamics of the genetic and epigenetic diversity at different phases of disease. In turn, this will guide the development of quantitative models of the evolutionary processes that can then be tested in the laboratory. The interplay between the modeling and data will guide strategies for future data collection and in vitro experiments to functionally test hypotheses that emanate from the modeling studies."

However, this approach vastly limits the size and complexity of the tissues that can be created due to the lack of stable, perfusable vasculature and the inability to replicate intricate multicellular configurations. Vasculature networks are central to living tissues, since all cells must reside within several hundred micrometers of a nutrient supply to survive. This award supports scientific investigations on a new additive manufacturing process for fabricating three-dimensional, vascularized living tissues composed of cells, extracellular matrix, and embedded blood vessels. Results from this research will enable broader use of 3D living tissues in the pharmaceutical industry for drug safety and toxicity screening and, ultimately, in the medicine for tissue repair and regeneration.<br/><br/>This research will establish the fundamental scientific understanding required for bioprinting of vascularized living tissue at organ scale.

The effects of vascular network architecture, including blood vessel size, spacing, and degree of branching, on cell viability and function will also be quantified by live/dead and, concurrently, barrier function of the vascular channels will be measured by a standard leak test as a function of different architectural motifs.  Finally, the relationship between nozzle size, design, and printing speed will be determined for cell-laden inks of varying cell type, concentration, and extracellular matrix composition to identify the requisite conditions that promote maximum cell viability, as determined by live/dead staining, during bioprinting and perfusion over long time periods."

The theme of the PI's overall research plan is to design innovative and intelligent hydrogels for applications in tissue engineering, which mimic nature's unique way of guiding complex tissue development and maintaining homeostasis.  The proposed research builds upon recent developments in stem cell research, which suggest that stem cell interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) provide both biochemical and biomechanical cues to guide differentiation.  Towards this end, the PI will build a fundamental connection between the hydrogel environment (via its chemistry and structure) and the translation of mechanical forces (in the form of dynamic compressive strains) through the hydrogel to the cells to guide stem cell differentiation in 3D.  This fundamental knowledge will be used to develop innovative multi-structured hydrogels where the structure and chemistry are spatially controlled to regulate both biochemical and biomechanical cues in 3D and differentially guide stem cell differentiation into cartilage and bone in a single hydrogel for osteochondral tissue engineering.  The 3D hydrogel stem cell niches developed by this work will enable certain biochemical (the ECM) and biomechanical cues to be isolated and their roles elucidated in MSC differentiation.  By systematically controlling the hydrogel niche the PI will be able to elucidate fundamental mechanisms involved in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation that involve their ECM and biomechanical environment.  From this fundamental knowledge this research will build innovative and complex 3D hydrogels for tissue engineering which (1) recapitulate these cues in 3D to mimic, to a certain degree, the translation of biomechanical signals within a normal joint and (2) are designed to manipulate stem cell fate to drive MSCs down differentiated lineages within a single hydrogel.  The proposed work will develop a new class of scaffolds for regenerating osteochondral tissues.  Overall, this research will impact that the training of 4 graduate students and at least 15 undergraduates<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  The proposed educational activities are closely intertwined with the PI?s overall research theme, which together will build a strong and diverse research program.  The PI will work closely with Adams State College, a Hispanic Serving Institution, in rural Colorado to develop a nurturing path for students, particularly those who are from Hispanic or Latino origin, from low-income families and/or first generation college students, to pursue engineering careers.  The proposed plan is rooted in creating strategies to increase participation in the pre-engineering program at Adams State College (ASC) by closely integrating the PI?s research in tissue engineering with educational programs.  Through close collaboration with ASC, the PI will create opportunities for ASC students to explore the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) campus and enhance their academic skills through a 10-week summer research program at CU-Boulder.  Together, these objectives will prepare ASC students to transfer successfully to CU-Boulder into Engineering and obtain a B.S.  degree in Engineering.  The proposed educational activities will begin a life-long partnership with a rural Colorado college, ASC, and create a pilot summer program that ultimately can be expanded to broadly impact other rural colleges."

Thousands of cells per second are passed through one or more laser beams and the light that is emitted or scattered from the cell is detected.  The system converts the detected light signals into electronic signals that are processed by a computer software program. Cell properties that can be measured include number, size, shape, and fluorescence intensity.  A FACS can also sort cells into different populations based on these properties.  The acquisition of a FACS will make a substantial improvement in the ability of faculty at CMU to conduct leading-edge research.  The FACS will be used by at least 21 faculty from the Biology, Chemistry, and Psychology Departments and the College of Medicine.  The faculty users will use the FACS in many diverse research projects ranging from assessing the microbial diversity of the Great Lakes to producing stem cells for transplantation into brains of animals. <br/><br/>The acquisition of the FACS will also direct the training of the next generation of scientists by providing access to state-of-the-art equipment.  It is estimated that 35 students/year will be trained to use the FACS through faculty-directed research projects. In addition, several of the faculty users serve as research mentors for undergraduate students participating in programs that are designed to increase the diversity of students pursuing careers in biological research.  Many more students will be exposed to the FACS through coursework.  The PI and co-PIs will develop a short course on FACS technologies available to faculty and students interested in utilizing the instrument for research.  In addition, there are several current 500-level Biology and Neuroscience courses servicing both undergraduates and graduate students in which laboratory exercises using flow cytometry and cell sorting will be incorporated.  The FACS will potentially benefit society through research projects that assess and protect the environmental health of the Great Lakes, further our knowledge of basic cellular processes, and understand brain function."

Traditionally, most of this analysis has been conducted on fixed tissue, which although informative, does not allow for the capture of the dynamic cellular movements that mediate morphogenetic events.  Given these constraints, it has become increasingly recognized in the field that live imaging can provide us with an extremely powerful mechanism for elucidating multiple key biological events.   <br/><br/>A fascinating developing system to which this technology can be applied, is the migrating neural crest.  The neural crest is a heterogeneous population of progenitor cells that migrate throughout the vertebrate embryo and give rise to a plethora of key derivatives, including the vast majority of the neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, the cartilage and mesectododerm of the face, and the melanocytes of the skin.  This system has been a major topic of study for over 100 years and these studies have contributed significantly to our understanding of stem cells, the effects of environmental cues on cellular differentiation and the role of prepatterning, intrinsic cues in specifiying cell fate. Because of the critical role the autonomic nervous system plays in maintaining homeostasis of all vertebrates, it is this system which we will investigate in this proposal.  <br/><br/>With the advent of fluorescent probes, migrating cells can be followed in living tissue for hours or days. From these data, scientists have developed new views of how neural crest cells migrate and form their distinctive derivatives.  In addition, in the chick embryo there are numerous mechanisms for conducting gain-and-loss of function molecular perturbations. Thus, the approach is to combine these two powerful technologies in order to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate the formation of the sympathetic nervous system from their precursor neural crest cells. <br/><br/>The experiments proposed here provide an excellent educational training opportunity for both the undergraduate and graduate students who will conduct the proposed experiments, and data gained from these studies will be discussed and analyzed in the undergraduate courses the PI teaches on campus.  Furthermore the PI often brings elementary students to the lab so that they can experience the thrill of watching live cells move in a real live embryo on the confocal microscope. There is no more effective means to make science immediate and tangible for the non-scientist than first hand experience in the lab."

Analysis of cells based on surface receptors typically involves a multi-step process requiring sample preparation, reagent storage, and use of laboratory equipment. Conventional approaches are challenging to implement in point-of-care settings and typically result in modification of the cells, which is undesirable for therapeutic applications. A new approach to separation of cells involves ""steering"" of cells that interact transiently with asymmetric receptor patterns. Such interactions, where receptor-ligand bonds are continuously formed and broken under the influence of fluid shear, occur in a physiological process known as cell rolling that is exhibited by major cell types including leukocytes, hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells, and cancer cells.<br/><br/>The research goal of this proposal is to elucidate 1) the transport of cells rolling on asymmetric patterned receptors, 2) engineering principles for designing surfaces with adequate specificity, and 3) the relationship between cell-surface interactions and the resulting separation process. A combination of experimental investigations and theoretical analysis will be used to study these aspects and provide insight into parameters that govern the cell rolling and separation. The PI has developed methods that allow for cell rolling and separation experiments on precisely patterned receptors, and analytical models that predict the effect of cellular and molecular parameters on cell rolling. These tools will be used to elucidate how transport of cells on asymmetric receptor patterns can be controlled by tuning the pattern geometry and fluid shear, and through a combination of different receptors. This work has the potential to define a new technique for separation and analysis of cells with simplicity of operation that makes it suitable for point-of-care applications, and opens possibilities for gentle separation of cells with implications for therapeutics and personalized medicine.<br/><br/>The educational and outreach activities are designed with the goal of conveying the excitement and relevance of micro- and nanoscale phenomena to students with diverse backgrounds, with emphasis on the fact that micro- and nano-scale phenomena have tangible effects that can be engineered for the benefit of society. An educational module will be developed to expose women high school students to micro and nano research through the Women's Technology Program at MIT. Experimental modules will be designed and implemented in a laboratory course to provide hands-on micro- and nanoengineering experience for senior undergraduate and graduate students of Mechanical Engineering at MIT. To reach a broader audience, these modules will be converted in a video format and disseminated via the internet. Finally, ten high school students from Thayer Academy will be given the opportunity to experience the academic research environment through annual summer internships in the PI's laboratory."

Shape and fate are intrinsic manifestations of form and function at the cellular level. At the length scale of the tissue, mechanical stress influences structure and function during prenatal development and postnatal healing. At the length scale of the embryonic mesenchymal stem cell, recent data demonstrate a high degree of mechanosensitivity, which modulates their assembly to form tissues and organs. Furthermore, recent  developmental biology and cell mechanics studies implicate cell shape as a powerful modulator of cell fate after homing of stem cells to target tissues in adult organisms. One aim of this research program is to study shape as a measure of a cell's adaptation to prevailing mechanical stimuli during de novo tissue formation. A further aim is to correlate the spatiotemporal enforcement of shape, via mechanical signals, to the specification of cell lineage (fate). Finally, a third goal is to test the feasibility of exploiting mechanical cues to engineer templates of bone and blood vessels for tissue replacements.<br/><br/>The research program will help to decipher how mechanical signals, intrinsic to life on Earth, modulate the adaptation and specialization of cells to their environment during prenatal development as well as engineering and manufacture of tissues. Through elucidation of Nature's mechanobiological engineering paradigms, mechanical cues can be exploited to prevent defects during development as well as to generate tissues in the laboratory and in the surgical operating room. The impact of the research program on education will be amplified through tight integration of the research approach and insights with a newly developed college level course Cell and Tissue Engineering: Learning from Nature's Mechanobiological Paradigms? and a Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) high school class which will be taught to student groups from Cleveland Municipal School District and inner ring schools."

The PI will lead teams of students and researchers to explore the synthesis of scaffolds based on self-assembly of viruses and viral conjugates at nano- or mesoscale, and to probe the extracellular interactions of cells with such viral assemblies. The ultimate goal is to mimic and thereby gain better understanding of the complexities and dynamics of the mammalian extracellular matrix (ECM). Two types of cells, i.e. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and rat bone marrow stromal cells (rBMSCs) will be employed in the study. These are ideal model systems to study how the viral based scaffolds will influence the cell adhesion, spreading, migration, proliferation, differentiation and clustering. The approach relies on preliminary results generated by the PI in the areas of bioconjugation chemistry, controlled VP assemblies, and cell biology. Spherical and rod-like plant viruses have been successfully assembled as a monolayer at the interface of two immiscible liquids. It was found that these types of viral assemblies showed interesting cell-adhesion behaviors, which stimulated interests to further pursue this research. Goals of the research are, (1) to display cell binding motifs on the exterior surface of VPs genetically and chemically; (2) to investigate the 2D self-assemblies of VPs at the liquid-liquid interfaces or on polymeric surfaces; (3) to characterize the cell adhesion and cell culture on the 2D viral arrays, and to study the cell response to the arrangement of VPs within the 2D arrays; (4) to study the adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of rBMSC with respect to VP assemblies; and (5) to study the cell adhesion and cell migration in response to the aligning patterns of viral assemblies which bear cell binding motifs.<br/><br/>With this CAREER award Professor Wang will probe cellular behaviors at nanometer resolution that will significantly impact both scientific and social communities. Gaining a better understanding of the cell machinery involved in differentiation, migration and outgrowth will improve understanding at the nanoscale level and will lead to technologically advanced materials with potential applications in biomedicine (intelligent implants, tissue engineering and regeneration, self-healing scaffolds, and multifunctional membranes). This multidisciplinary research will give students a chance to develop many advanced research skills and provide invaluable social networks that will serve them well into their future careers. An Open Laboratory for Bionanoparticle Technology (OLBT) has been established to serve as the unifying platform for the training of multilevel participants - from high school students, to undergraduate and graduate students, and to postdoctoral fellows. In particular, the PI plans to design a series of practical and simple educational experiments related to bionanotechnology for the purpose of teaching. Such experiments can be used in the teaching of graduate and undergraduate courses, as well as in the 'Summer Camp for Bionanotechnology' for high school students that will provide hands-on experience in the nanosciences.<br/>"

These biomaterials will give the user control of specific physical, chemical, and biological cues comprising the cell microenvironment in both time and space.  To accomplish this significant challenge, the proposed work will exploit the classic alkyne/azide click chemistry, modified to enable a cytocompatible copper-free polymerization, to synthesize basic hydrogels as a simplified mimic of the extracellular matrix in the presence of cells.  The biochemical functionality of the gels will then be tuned using a new variant of click chemistry, a thiol-ene photoaddition reaction, that is fully compatible with peptide chemistry and allows spatiotemporally regulated introduction of biological epitopes.  Finally, a photodegradable linker will be integrated into the crosslinks of the base gel formulation to allow light directed degradation of the material.  Using these three independent and cytocompatible reactions for gelation, photodegradation, and photocoupling, dynamic biomaterials systems will be created that will provide newfound opportunities to probe the dynamic exchange of information between cells and their microenvironment.  The specific aims of this work are to: (1) synthesize click-based hydrogels using orthogonal chemistries that allow manipulation of the material properties through photodegradation and introduction of biological epitopes through a photocoupling reaction, (2) manipulate the properties of the above hydrogels through photodegradation, photocoupling, and combined photodegradation and photocoupling, (3) culture human mesenchymal cells (hMSCs) on 2D gel surfaces and characterize morphology, cytoskeletal organization, and focal adhesions as a function of elasticity and patterned adhesive ligand presentation, (4) encapsulate hMSCs in 3D and examine their response to material-directed morphological changes and spatially varying adhesive ligand distribution, (5) train a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of polymer chemistry and molecular biology, and (6) disseminate these results to the industrial and academic public to assure maximum impact on fundamental and applied biomaterials chemistry.<br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  This new class of multifunctional hydrogels will help overcome numerous problems with existing 3D cell culture platforms by providing a facile means for manipulating material functionality and mechanics with spatial and temporal control.  These new materials will enable researchers to probe fundamental biological questions via a variety of previously unattainable 3D cell studies.   The efficient nature of the gel chemistry will allow its adoption by a wide array of non-experts. These material systems should find applications for basic 3D cell culture, design of tissue engineering matrices, platforms for drug delivery and screening, stand-alone biomaterials implants, as well as other non-biological applications. The multidisciplinary team environment in the Anseth laboratory, coupled with long-standing collaborations with world-class clinical and biological laboratories, will provide an exceptional educational environment for multiple graduate and undergraduate students. The PI and her research group have a history of extensive outreach to high school students and the general public, and the team will work diligently through multiple mechanisms to highlight the impact of biomaterial science in benefiting society."

The conference chairs are Sean Palecek and Charles Murray.<br/><br/>The field of stem cells has rapidly emerged as an important multidisciplinary area of research in biology, bioengineering, and medicine. There are no forums, however, whose primary goal is to bring together biologists, physician-scientists and engineers to discuss ways in which their disciplines can collaborate to find novel solutions to problems that are limiting the development of new technologies and therapies. In response to this need, SBE in collaboration with AIChE is organizing and instituting the Third International Conference on Stem Cell Engineering (ICSCE).<br/><br/>The Third ICSCE will be the third in a series of ICSCE meetings, held every two years, designed to bring together researchers from academia and industry that are using quantitative approaches and novel technology development to advance the understanding and application of stem cell biology and engineering. The ICSCE meeting series will serve to promote, shape, and refine the definition of the Stem Cell Engineering field.  Approximately 200 people are expected to attend.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit <br/>There is currently no other meeting that provides a forum for the emerging field of Stem Cell Engineering. Although engineers attend international meetings such as the International Society for Stem Cell Research meeting, there is no direct forum for interactions between stem cell engineers and stem cell biologists at this or similar events. The fact that the ISSCR has agreed to co-organize this event is a testament to the recognition of the importance for balanced interactions between these two communities.<br/>From the bioengineering side, although there are other conferences that have some programming in stem cell engineering (AIChE, ACS, BMES), this programming is often diffuse and does not include the presence of world leaders in multiple facets of stem cell biology or stem cell engineering. In these three cases, the format of the large meetings also does not foster the same level of interaction among participants. There are also smaller meetings on stem cells, of similar size to ICSCE, such as Keystone Symposia. These have very high quality programming, but their focus has been more in the area of stem cell and developmental biology, with limited to no engineering content. Finally, there are also small scale, for-profit conferences that successfully draw elements from academia and industry, but these are often not attended by leading figures from biology and engineering.<br/><br/>Broader Impact <br/>None of the organizations cited above caters to the specific aims of the ICSCE. Furthermore, we believe that our emphasis on the integration of stem cell biology and engineering at many levels is new and unique, and this theme is reflected throughout our scientific program. Support is sought for the Third ICSCE in this application, and the organizers intend for this conference to continue to be held every two years.<br/><br/>The Theme of this third meeting is ?Designing Cellular Therapies?, and the Aims of this conference are to provide a venue:<br/>1. For scientific presentations from a diverse group of leading stem cell biology and engineering<br/>researchers who cover the breadth of the emerging field of Stem Cell Engineering.<br/>2. For interactions between academic and industry researchers, who bring different approaches and perspectives to the technical aspects and commercialization potential of Stem Cell Engineering.<br/>3. For active participation by Ph.D. students and postdoctoral trainees in stem cell biology and<br/>bioengineering fields, who represent the future of stem cell biology and engineering.<br/>4. For bringing biologists, physician-scientists and engineers together in an collaborative atmosphere to discuss their disciplines and approaches, and to motivate new research that overcomes barriers limiting the development of stem cell-based technologies.<br/>5. For improving the access of the field of Stem Cell Engineering to a diverse group of scientists,<br/>including bioengineers with little stem cell experience and women and underrepresented groups.<br/>6. For understanding the increasingly global nature of the field of Stem Cell Engineering and identifying how international collaborations can facilitate the advancement of this field.<br/><br/>The scope, theme, and aims of the meeting fall squarely within the mission of the NSF, which has been increasingly committed to integrating the physical and engineering sciences with the life sciences, encouraging research and development in multidisciplinary areas, educating the next generation of young researchers, and helping increase the diversity of the workforce in science and engineering.<br/>This application, if successful, will directly impact Aims 3-6, by providing partial support for graduate student/postdoctoral associate participants, and by providing a forum for the interactions between normally separated leading scientists and engineers to stimulate new ideas that could benefit economic and health-related activity.<br/><br/>Funding from NSF would go specifically to support young investigators and graduate students.  Attention was paid to increase numbers of women and underrepresented minorities on the organizing committee, and as speakers, as well as among attendees.  Conference materials will be available on a public web site after the conference."

Using two-photon polymerization to fabricate 3D matrices, they study cell adhesion and migration in three dimensions. Cell migration research is taking intriguing new turns and emerging studies are revealing marked differences in the way that cells migrate in two versus three dimensions. Such studies are important to understand a variety of physiological and pathological processes such as progression of cancer, metastasis, and tissue regeneration. The main goal of this proposal is to develop a synthetic three-dimensional extracellular matrix (ECM) that permits independent and precise spatial control of biochemical and biophysical cues.  <br/><br/>Specifically, they will develop two-photon polymerization system to fabricate three-dimensional matrix with varying physical and chemical properties. They will then perform a systematic study on cell migration by varying several parameters of the ECM in a controlled way. The effects of pore size and shape, mechanical-stiffness, adhesion peptide concentration of the ECM walls, degradation of the matrix on cell motility, and adhesion will be studied. This approach will allow them to have a precise, independent control over architecture as well as various adhesion and mechanical parameters at a micrometer and submicrometer scale to study their role in cell migration in a systematic manner. Finally, the proposed work will demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach to study various cell and tissue processes in isolation in order to address novel problems in biology."

To address questions aimed at defining these regulatory interactions, it is necessary to accurately quantify changes in gene expression that result in downstream effects on cell/organism function. To that end, real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis provides a method by which changes in gene expression can be quantified. This approach allows precise assessment of transcriptional targets whose gene products are responsible for modulating adaptive responses. This grant will support the purchase of a Polymerase Chain Reaction machine that will be enable real-time PCR methodology to investigate multiple projects centered on examining diverse biological processes including immunology, cell survival, inflammation, tissue repair, differentiation, and smooth muscle cell biology. Projects of note include characterization of the effects of mechanical forces and extracellular matrix interactions on modulating function of smooth muscle cells and differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells. In the area of inflammation, the processes that regulate inflammatory responses in immune cells and brain as well as the downstream transcriptional targets of immune modulators will be investigated in macrophage and glial cell lines. These studies will be aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms that result in initiation of cell survival and tissue repair in glial and neuronal cells. Finally, this technique will also be applied to study the role of the unfolded protein response during immune response, with a focus on cytokine production by B lymphocytes.<br/><br/>Assessment of gene expression patterns will allow the faculty at Mt. St. Mary's University to make more significant contributions to their research fields and will directly impact the training of students by enhancing the undergraduate educational experience. The current proposal describes a total of 11 research and educational projects to be carried out by four faculty members. Importantly, several of the projects address approaches for incorporation of real-time PCR methodology into both the undergraduate curriculum and outreach educational programs aimed at local high schools. This instrumentation provides a means by which to incorporate an inquiry based approach to science instruction. Rapid advances in the understanding of cellular and biochemical processes as a result of genetic and genomic research have generated considerable demand for individuals trained in biotechnology, genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology. Funds from this grant will be used to meet the challenge of improving undergraduate education in STEM areas and enhance student preparation for successful careers in the life sciences."

These events, which generate the body plan and the various organs, depend on regulated gene expression, elaborate interactions between and among cells, and coordinated cell movement. Gene expression by itself cannot give a full account of the emergence of body plans, specific forms and shapes. Genetics and biochemistry interact with the physical properties of individual cells and cell aggregates in the course of development, making it a multiscale process of enormous complexity. As in many complex processes, however, one can discover dynamical and organizational rules at various levels if appropriate techniques are used to analyze developing organisms. This project brings together biologists, experimental and theoretical physicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists, each of whom has experience analyzing individual biophysical problems, and brings their expertise to bear on a specific developmental process-the formation of the vertebrate limb. Experimental and theoretical methods will be used to investigate the emergence of the limb bud from the body wall, the control of genes mediating cell aggregation, the spatiotemporal regulation of the limb skeletal pattern, and the ingrowth of nerve fibers into the limb from the spinal cord.<br/><br/>This work will result in a multilevel characterization including subcellular, cellular and supracellular mechanisms which will provide a causal understanding of vertebrate limb development, as well as generate analytical tools that can be used to study similar problems in developmental biology. These tools will include software for solving the inevitably complex systems of mathematical equations that describe the interplay of genetic and material properties found in living embryos. New software will be built and distributed to model not only limb development, but also other types of organ formation and illness (e.g. tumor metastasis and vascularization). The overall strategy represents a step towards genuinely integrated research on animal development to deliver on the promise of the gene sequencing projects of the previous decade.<br/>"

More than 2 million orthopedic procedures per year use bone grafts to repair damaged bone, at a cost exceeding $30 billion. Despite this need, there are limited supplies of bone tissue for grafts. Recombinant (artificially produced) proteins can be used as an alternative to grafts, but they are expensive and have potential adverse side effects. In collaboration with researchers in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, this research will develop innovative gene-activated materials that encourage the body's own cells to produce the proteins needed for bone tissue repair. This will advance the nation's health and promote the progress of science by developing material systems that can be used to promote the healing of many tissues in the body, in addition to bone. The educational outreach component of this proposal will help students understand how biological materials behave mechanically and how this knowledge can be used to develop replacement materials for clinical use. Interactive STEM research kits will be developed for middle and high school students to enhance understanding of the measurement techniques used to quantify mechanical behavior of biological materials, including bone and synthetic materials used to replace biological materials clinically.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to design a materials-based approach for the controlled delivery of novel osteoanabolic genetic cargos using non-viral vectors combined with osteoconductive scaffolds to promote healing of large bone defects. To achieve this goal, a hybrid material system will be designed and validated; the system will consist of a peptide vector to deliver genetic cargo and a collagen/hydroxyapatite scaffold to present the genetic cargo to cells in the healing space and provide osteoconductive surfaces. The material system will be validated by assessing its ability to promote bone formation activity in vitro and bone healing in vivo. The novel therapeutic genetic cargos for local delivery are parathyroid hormone (PTH), microRNA 26A mimic (miR-26a), and an inhibitor to microRNA133a (antagomiR-133a). The RALA peptide is a non-viral vector that will be used to deliver the therapeutic cargos using a collagen-based scaffold designed specifically for bone repair. The efficacy of the gene activated scaffolds at promoting osteoanabolic activity in mesenchymal stem cells in vitro will be evaluated by quantifying gene expression of key osteogenic and angiogenic markers. The safety of the gene-activated scaffolds will be evaluated in vivo by assessing the distribution of the genetic cargos in tissues and organs. The efficacy will be evaluated by quantifying bone formation in a critical size femoral defect using micro-computed tomography and histomorphometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To become motile, cells must undergo radical changes in their composition and behavior, the so-called epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT).  These radical changes arise as the network of genes controlling the state of the cell transitions from one type of stable fate to another. This project details a joint theory-experiment physics-biology effort to study how EMT is coordinated in space and time by chemical signals passed among the tumor cells.  The specific focus here is on the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway has been studied extensively for its role in developmental biology and has been implicated indirectly in cancer, but has never been studied systematically in this context. The hypothesis to be investigated is that this pathway can allow the formation of small clusters of cells that have undergone EMT together, and which thereafter travel as a collective en route to the establishment of a secondary tumor. If proven to be true, these ideas will shed light on the fundamental origins of metastasis and might in the future offer new strategies for both prognosis and treatment.<br/> <br/>Cell-cell interactions, both between tumor cells proper and between tumor and stromal cells, are known to be a key component of many solid tumors. The investigators will focus on how one of these interactions, that mediated by the Notch pathway, can coordinate cell phenotypes and can thereby control tumor progression. To accomplish this will require the use and extension of sophisticated theory techniques from the field of non-equilibrium pattern formation coupled to an experimental plan focused on pancreatic cancer cell lines to be studied in both 2d and 3d in vitro conditions, both without and with supporting cancer-associated fibroblasts. Of particular importance will be measuring spatial correlations of EMT state (and other known correlates) and comparing these to expectations based on different signaling assumptions. Iterating these experiments with increasingly realistic model-building and model-solving will allow for the creation of a quantitatively reliable picture for the collective behavior of the tumor, going well-beyond current individual cell approaches.<br/><br/>This project is cofunded by the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Physics Division and the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division at NSF."

Non-viral vectors can avoid the safety issue inherent to the viruses, but lack the capability of recognizing target cells and have low efficiency of transferring gene into the target cells. This project will mimic the cell-recognition capability of a nanoparticle-like virus called phage, which can specifically infect bacteria and is non-toxic to human beings, to develop a novel nanoparticle that can serve as a non-viral gene delivery vector. Mesenchymal stem cells are used as a model cell type to test the capability of the gene delivery into the target cells by the non-viral vector.

Then the capability of gene transfer by the resultant nanoparticles is evaluated by using a fluorescent reporter gene for optically detecting gene expression. This transformative project will develop peptide-modified inorganic nanoparticles that can deliver therapeutic gene to mammalian cells. The technique developed in this project can be extended to form nanoparticles that can deliver other cargos to mammalian cells. The novel nanoparticles represent virus-mimicking non-viral vectors and can find potential applications in treating diseases by gene therapy.<br/><br/>This project will have broader impacts on bioengineering, materials science, chemistry, biology, and nanomedicine.

Current procedures are fraught with problems that limit clinical success. One important approach for the treatment of bone fractures and defects is in the use of injectable fillers or cements. However, current bone cements do not adequately support bone healing, and may lead to poor clinical outcomes. This project utilizes a novel method in preparing polymers to generate an injectable bone filler that cures within the body, and forming a rigid and strong foam implant. This specially prepared polymer composite is expected to promote bone regeneration and growth by stimulating cells around the polymer. In addition to improving care for patients that suffer from traumatic bone injuries, these studies will provide exceptional training of future scientists in materials research. Educational and outreach activities will focus on strategies that enhance recruitment and retention of women and minorities in science and engineering areas in addressing the national needs to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in the scientific and engineering workforce. Finally, this Israeli-US partnership provides opportunities to train students to compete globally through a summer internship exchanges at the partnering laboratories.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL: <br/>Current injectable bone cements used for bone fracture and repairs are of limited value because of lack of cement porosity, limited biodegradability, prolonged recovery time and lack of significant stabilization and support of the damaged bones. In addition, these synthetic scaffolds lack cellular cues to promote bone repair and regeneration, without the addition of growth factors in the injectable cements, and these involve high costs and safety concerns. To address these issues, this project will develop a novel high internal phase emulsion graft polymers (polyHIPE) using an emulsion-templating method. The graft polymers prepared will be used to generate injectable bone fillers that cure within the body to form rigid foams that are: 1) surface-modified with collagen-mimetic proteins to induce osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells; and 2) prepared without surfactants to minimize concerns with respect to biocompatibility of leached breakdown products from these surfactants. Additionally, bioactive nanoparticles with different size, distribution, and hydrophobicity will be incorporated in these graft polymers, and these nanoparticles are expected to migrate spontaneously to the pore surface of the foam during curing process in the body. This migration of nanoparticle not only strengthen the cured polymer cement but is also expected to promote enhanced bone regeneration by stimulating cells in the polymer pores. Overall, these studies are designed such that fundamental advances will be made in synthesis and application of novel materials for the integrin-mediated osteogenesis for injectable bone grafts. Although this work is focused on bone repair and regeneration, the knowledge gained has potential to be applied to a variety of other applications such as development of membranes with well-defined pore size in battery and for water purification. Students participating in the research will receive rigorous training in material science and tissue engineering that will prepare them for careers in biomedical engineering. This collaboration with Israeli scientists would also provide opportunities in training students through a summer internship exchange at the partnering laboratory and prepare these students to compete globally. An integrated educational platform will focus on strategies that enhance recruitment and retention of women and minorities in engineering to address the national need to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in the scientific and engineering workforce."

The success of this most desirable treatment rests on the development of 3D structures to which cells can attach and form firm bonds. The ideal material to make such scaffolds should be biomechanically similar to the host tissue and must be biocompatible, preferably be bioactive so as to actively control tissue growth. The most successful results of this approach have been obtained for bone replacement using bone-scaffolds made from CaO-P2O5-SiO2 based glasses. A macro porous structure is necessary to obtain good implant incorporation through rapid vascularization and bone ingrowth, yet an ideal scaffold should consist of nanopores that simulate the extracellular environment for the development of connective tissue. Thus an ideal bone-scaffold must consist of a bimodal distribution of nano-macro pores. The process for fabricating bimodal porosity in a bioactive glass with prescribed mechanical and biocompatibility properties does not exist. Therefore, a comprehensive research program is proposed for fabricating bone-scaffolds and demonstrating their efficacy under controlled in vitro and realistic in vivo environment (alveolar bone regeneration utilizing bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells). Sol-gel method will be the primary method of glass preparation in which bimodal porosity will be introduced in established Bioglass type compositions  either by polymerization-induced phase separation simultaneously with the sol-gel transition, or via macroporous templates. To optimize the glass composition and processing parameters, we will investigate the physical and chemical structure of the bulk and surface of glass, the bone-scaffold interface, and newly formed bone. The very broad scope of our goal will be pursued collaboratively by glass synthesis chemists, physical glass scientists, surface scientists, dentists with expertise in tissue engineering, and biomechanics specialists, forming a team of five groups from Egypt, Portugal, Senegal and USA.<br/><br/>With regard to broad impact, the project will help develop a better treatment of bone tissue loss in aging population or patients suffering from a trauma.

It will also help establish a focused materials world network of researchers in cross-disciplinary materials research, and train young scientists in four countries from three continents with one common goal.

During gastrulation cells from the outside of the embryo travel inward through the embryo, itself, which eventually leads to the formation of the internal organs. Without the evolutionary advent of gastrulation, the animal form might still be stuck at the flatworm stage. Gastrulation depends on a critical process known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, which represents a fundamental switch in cell behavior from preferring a cohesive interconnected state between individual cells to one in which cells prefer to move about independently. It turns out that this switch, which is normal and healthy during early development, can be devastating to humans when it turns on again in the case of some malignant tumors. Indeed, this is the switch that is one of the primary causes of cancer spreading known as metastasis. It is now known that this switch is also one of the primary drivers of fibrotic disease processes. The objective of this project is to study the biophysical mechanisms underlying the switch during gastrulation using the bird embryo as a model system. Our overall hypothesis is that localized upregulation of actomyosin contractility is a required driving force that underlies maintenance of the primitive streak during gastrulation and is critical for the cellular switch. To better understand the specific role of actomyosin contractility in these processes, the investigators will use a combination of high-resolution time-lapse microscopy, quantitative bioengineering analyses, and biochemical/molecular perturbations. The long-term goal of the research is to understand how mechanical forces regulate and control this switch, and to use this knowledge to treat diseases, such as cancer and fibrosis, as well as to construct and shape living tissues de novo that can be used for applications in tissue engineering.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts<br/>This project will result in the advanced training of undergraduate and graduate researchers with unique analytical skills based on a multi-disciplinary, integrative approach involving experimental and theoretical aspects of cell and developmental biology and engineering.

During embryogenesis these midline-crossing neurons are formed through an elaborate process of cell guidance that instructs pathfinding axons across the midline prior to reaching their synaptic targets. This process of ""axon guidance"" requires important cell-to-cell interactions between the pathfinding axon and the cells in its local environment. The Barresi Lab seeks to determine what the cell types are that make up the growth substrate for pathfinding axons, define the live interactions that occur, and determine whether a protein called Slit1a mediates these interactions at the midline.  <br/><br/>The Barresi lab has characterized a simple system to assay midline-crossing axons interacting with a glial cells functioning as a growth substrate in the developing forebrains of living zebrafish zebrafish embryos. Using this system, they will also test the role Slit-Roundabout molecular signaling plays in regulating this interaction. They propose to exploit the embryological, molecular and genetic techniques available with the zebrafish model system to test directly whether glial cells play a role in midline crossing of these axons.  Additionally, they will test whether Slit1a positively mediates axon-glial interactions. Barresi hypothesizes that distinct populations of astroglia are required for midline crossing through a Slit1a-Robo1 mediated mechanism of axon-glial interaction. This work will provide a molecular, cellular and behavioral understanding of how neuron-glial interactions occur in the live developing brain, which could change our current understanding of brain development that is mostly based on fixed tissue analysis. <br/><br/>Importantly, Barresi has also created a collaborative outreach program between an underserved public high school, a biotech company, and Smith College to train high school teachers and students in molecular and developmental biology.

An engineered scaffold should mimic the complexity of the bone extracellular matrix by providing temporary structural support, degrade concurrent with cell migration to increase free volume for new matrix formation, and provide sites for cell adhesion and proliferation. It is hypothesized that a composite scaffold crosslinked with a functionalized peptide that has multiple covalently-linked active domains can coordinate multiple regenerative functions, mimicking the natural signaling cascade leading to bone morphogenesis. With this hypothesis in mind, the objective of this project is to determine the effects of a peptide with multiple bioactive domains consisting of a domain that binds to apatite nanoparticles, a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) degradable domain, and an integrin-binding RGD domain on temporary structural support, matrix degradation concurrent with cell migration, and cell adhesion and proliferation, respectively. The multi-domain peptide will covalently link the hydrogel phase to the inorganic nanoapatite phase to form a multi-functional composite scaffold. Three tasks are proposed to demonstrate the proof-of-concept: First, a molecular model will be used to predict the viscoelastic response of the nanocomposite and to find the effective range of concentrations of the apatite nanoparticles, multi-functional apatite-binding peptide, and the MMP degradable peptide crosslinker. Second, the ability of the composite scaffold to modulate cell migration to scaffold degradation will be determined in-vitro with bone marrow stromal (BMS) cells. Third, the effect of the nanocomposite matrix on osteogenesis/vasculogenesis and mineralized matrix production will be determined in-vitro by seeding with BMS cells and in-vivo by implantation in the rat calvarial defect model. The broader impact of this work lies in the application of these ideas to areas other than skeletal tissue regeneration, like dental restoration, osteoarthritis and cartilage regeneration, treatment of degenerative disk disease, replacement of heart valves, targeted peptidomimetic drug delivery systems, and in developing substrates for concurrent differentiation of progenitor cells to multiple lineages. A broad educational component is part of this project, wherein graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from the overall research approach, which integrates materials science and engineering, biochemistry, molecular and cell biology, and orthopedics to design scaffolds for tissue regeneration. As part of the outreach program, a high school student is selected each summer to participate in research related to tissue engineering."

The systematic approach used here to integrate collagen biomaterials with photochemically controlled immobilization techniques will enable design of new classes of biomaterials for complex tissue engineering applications that recapitulate much of the biomolecular complexity found in native tissues and tissue interfaces. Simple, yet generic tethering chemistries that allow spatial localization of a wide range of biomolecules as well as exogenously or endogenously cued release of the same biomolecules will be invaluable for generating novel classes of instructive biomaterials. Such materials would offer the ability to mimic the dynamic and spatial heterogeneities of the natural extracellular matrix. Apart from basic insights into developing molecularly general methods for creating spatially and temporally patterned instructive cues within 3D biomaterials, this work will enable fabrication of new classes of biomaterials for both translational regenerative medicine as well as mechanistic investigations of cell behavior. Broader impacts of this work are both to re-imagine how biomaterials can be used to control cell behaviors as well as to provide a valuable multidisciplinary training experience that affords significant research projects for undergraduates from multiple departments and colleges across campus. In doing this, this project will create a highly interdisciplinary environment that exposes, educates, and empowers the next generation of undergraduate and graduate engineers and chemists to address critical challenges at the intersection of biological, physical, and engineering sciences. <br/><br/>Tissues are complex, three-dimensional environments that present multiple types of cues which regulate cell fate.

Materials created using the patterning tools developed here will be both instructive and responsive to surrounding cells and tissues, and will provide mechanistic insights into cell-matrix interactions as well advanced bioactive materials for more complex regenerative medicine applications. Through a coordinated research and educational plan, the project will directly support a number of critical outreach programs on campus. The tools developed during this project will serve as the foundation for ongoing and future novel research projects at the confluence of chemistry-biology-engineering disciplines for under-represented undergraduate students in science and engineering, and will form the basis for a new teaching module in an ongoing Tissue Engineering course on campus."

Bone, for example, displays high toughness at low weight and is capable of self-repair; some invertebrate teeth self-sharpen despite continuous wear. Organisms typically form these materials under mild conditions through environmentally sustainable processes, making them appealing targets for bio-inspired or bio-enabled syntheses. Despite the abundance of such materials in nature, many biological mechanisms that allow the organism to control their formation remain poorly understood. As a model organism, sea urchins exert remarkable control over mineralization, creating smoothly curving and branched, yet single crystalline endoskeletal spicules of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Previously, the team designed an in vitro culture system of sea urchin embryo primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) to control the growth of these spicules in the laboratory. They discovered that a signaling protein, VEGF, controls the shape of spicules deposited by PMCs. The team will next probe the roles of a number of proteins that have been identified as potential crystal growth regulators in transcriptomics experiments. Techniques include, proteomics, in vitro assays in microfluidic droplet reactors, and knock-down experiments in vivo. In combination, these studies will lead to an improved understanding of biologically controlled mineralization.

In prior work, the team discovered the role of VEGF signaling in branching of endoskeletal single crystals of calcite that are deposited by primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) of the sea urchin embryo. Going forward, the team will use quantitative proteomics to confirm proteins that have been identified by transcriptomics as candidates involved in crystal growth control. Selected proteins will be produced recombinantly, and recombinant antibodies (rAbs) will be raised against them. rAbs will be used to map proteins across the spicule deposition vesicle and the spicule itself. In parallel, the team will use existing microfluidic devices to dissect the impact of native and recombinant proteins, individually and collectively on nucleation, polymorph selection, and crystal growth. Finally, the team will complement these experiments with functional analyses in vivo. Taken together, the team expects to develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of how expression of the relevant proteins, localization in the spicule matrix, and impact on nucleation kinetics and crystal growth may be connected. This is an important first step towards translating key molecular players into a system that is more easily engineered and scaled up, using the tools of synthetic biology for materials processing. The team will thereby address all four challenges in hard materials identified in the Report on the 2012 NSF Biomaterials Workshop. Complementary to the proposed research objectives, the team will engage undergraduates in research, incorporate research outcomes into undergraduate laboratory modules, and host high school interns through Northwestern University's Science in Society program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many different organisms, from bacteria to humans, use sophisticated organic/inorganic composite materials for mechanical support (e.g., bone), feeding (tooth enamel), defense, and sensing of light, gravity, and the magnetic field. Work in the researcher's laboratory revolves around developing a biotechnological alternative to material synthesis, i.e. modifying an existing biological system rather than re-creating it in the laboratory. Earlier studies by this researcher have demonstrated that the shape and crystallographic growth direction of spicules deposited by primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) could be controlled using a recombinant protein, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Building on these results, the team aims to increase the understanding of, and mastery over, the crystal growth process in PMC culture. For this purpose, the effect of VEGF concentration on the structure and composition of the spicule at length scales from nanometers to hundreds of microns will be determined, using sophisticated characterization techniques such as atom probe tomography, tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray microscopy. Special attention will be given to the distribution of proteins in the biomineral and the surrounding vesicle, using a combination of proteomics and specific antibody-based imaging. Possible functional roles of proteins on nucleation and growth will be established in in vitro assays. In this manner, the team hopes to learn how biological regulation and processing of a complex composite material are connected, essentially linking the biological and the materials genome. This knowledge could impact a wide range of areas from programmed synthesis of bone grafts to large-scale carbon dioxide sequestration. Research findings will be disseminated not only to technical audiences through publications and at conferences, but also through integration in undergraduate laboratory exercises and by engaging undergraduate students in the research as paid laboratory assistants. Finally, members of the team will reach out to local schools and perform experiments with high and middle school students using a mobile laboratory.<br/><br/>Technical: Mineralized tissues are sophisticated hybrid materials with highly hierarchical architecture and remarkable control over crystal growth at multiple length scales. Despite great recent progress in bio-inspired material synthesis, many of the hallmarks of biological crystal growth have yet to be reproduced in vitro: polymorph control, curving and/or branching single crystals, and nm scale control of organic-inorganic composites. Clearly, much could be gained by developing a biotechnological alternative to materials synthesis. This researcher's team earlier has developed an in vitro culture system of sea urchin embryo primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) to control the deposition of single crystalline spicules made from calcite (CaCO3). A fundamental discovery of the prior funding period was that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling controls the shape and crystallographic growth direction of spicules deposited by PMC; the protein does so without directly interacting with the mineral. This provides the unique opportunity to investigate the mechanism underlying this remarkable example of biological control over crystal growth in a well-characterized in vitro cell culture system. The team will do so at three different length scales. At the sub-micron scale, the team will investigate, using a combination of atom probe tomography, tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray microscopy, the role of organic-mineral interfaces in crystal growth and the impact of the VEGF concentration on the micro/nanostructure and composition of spicules. At the submicron to subcellular length scales, the team will use a combination of quantitative proteomics and imaging using specific antibodies to elucidate the distribution of spicule matrix proteins. Possible functional roles of proteins on nucleation and growth will be established in in vitro assays. Finally, at the system scale, the impact of temporal patterns of VEGF signaling on the crystal branching will be determined. The proposed research will impact the understanding how skeletal elements arise from biological processes at different length scales and how biological processing affects crystal growth. This is a first step to connect developmental biology to the materials genome. This knowledge could impact a wide range of areas from programmed synthesis of bone grafts to large-scale carbon dioxide sequestration. An important component of the proposed activity is an education and outreach-plan that complements the research objectives and is well integrated; its elements are dissemination of research results and methods in the undergraduate curriculum, engagement of students in the research activities, and outreach to local middle and high schools using a mobile laboratory."

The housekeeping role can protect the embryo from external toxicants during embryogenesis. The developmental role can pump endogenous signaling molecules out of cells to influence adjacent cells or to feedback on the cell itself in an autocrine fashion. Preliminary work reveals members of the mrp family of ABC efflux transporters are dormant in the unfertilized sea urchin egg and become active as part of the response to fertilization. The increased activity appears to result from movement of vesicles containing these transporters to the egg surface after fertilization and insertion of the proteins into the membrane. Proposed experiments will prove or disprove the vesicle movement hypothesis using antibodies to follow any changes in the location of the transport proteins.<br/>Preliminary results suggest several developmental roles. One is a role in forwarding cell division during the cleavage period. The proposed research will examine specificity of the effect by injection of antibodies to the active site of the transporter. If indicated as a specific effect a search will be made for the active substance effluxed by the transporter. A plausible endogenous substrate are leukotrienes and levels of these compounds will be measured during cleavage and later development. <br/>The other transporter function is a role in signaling in primary mesenchyme cell differentiation, perhaps in the cross-talk between ectoderm and underlying mesenchyme cells. The proposed studies will describe the expression of new transporters during development, localize them by in situ hybridization and assess their role using morpholinos to specifically prevent new transport expression. <br/>This work also broadens the view of efflux transporters, which has in the past been primarily centered on their medical relevance in terms of evading drug therapy during treatment against cancer. The proposed research looks at these ubiquitous molecules in new ways; in terms of a fertilization response leading to  re-organization of the plasma membrane, in terms of a role in normal cell functions such as mitosis and in terms of a signaling role for integrating morphogenetic responses. <br/>The proposed research also has broad impact on education, as many of these experimental results can be integrated into laboratory exercises used in introductory biology labs at Stanford and in high school and college exercises across the country. To facilitate this, exercises suggested by this research will be disseminated on the widely used (last year received 4 million hits) Sea Urchin Embryology web site (http://www.stanford.edu/group/Urchin/ ).This combination of environmental work with cell and developmental biology also attracts numerous undergraduate students to the P.I's lab (often from under-represented groups); these students often receive University recognition for outstanding undergraduate research and many of these students later go on to graduate study in developmental biology and environmental sciences<br/><br/>"

The kidney is a hotspot for birth defects that affect the size, number, and arrangement of filtration units, called nephrons, and the tubules that carry urine within the kidney and out to the bladder. This project seeks determine the engineering rules that guide tubules as they form in the kidney and then to mimic nephron fusion with the tubule network. Together, these activities will create more ""true-to-life"" kidney tissues in a dish that can be used to study the origin of kidney birth defects at a fundamental level and inform new intervention strategies for childhood and adult diseases that originate from such defects. Two integrated educational projects are designed to equip a new generation of young scientists with the quantitative skills needed to contribute to the emerging discipline of ?developmental engineering."" The first project is creating a summer research experience for undergraduate students in which participation will be broadened by focusing recruitment efforts on under-represented minority, women, and first-generation students through several partnerships based on the investigator?s commitment to removing barriers to the use and generation of technology by all people. The second project is creating free and publicly available lesson/lecture plan modules through a crowd science platform called quanti.us. These modules will serve high school and undergraduate sciences educators and aim to stoke student interest in cutting-edge scientific problems while equipping them with quantitative problem-solving approaches.<br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term research goal is to develop advanced biomanufacturing strategies based on the control of tissue morphogenesis with expectations that efforts will lead to the creation of human tissues with sufficient complexity to be models for drug development or directly in regenerative medicine. Toward this goal, this CAREER project is focused on mimicking nephron differentiation and fusion with the ureteric tree in synthetic tissue models of the developing kidney, which will be accomplished by generating human kidney tubule networks with controlled size and connectivity and then directing nephron formation at many spatial sites within them to better capture kidney structure at cm-scale.  The project addresses the need for models of kidney development outside of the body with sufficient organization across length-scales to properly study common development diseases of the kidney such as CAKUT (congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract), which is marked by incomplete organization of epithelial networks necessary for kidney function. Studies are designed to test the hypothesis that the mechanical microenvironment of kidney epithelial bud branching into the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) ""mesenchyme"" during development sculpts tubule elongation and geometric spacing.  The research plan is organized under two specific aims: (1) Determine the mechanical contribution of the tissue micro-environment to epithelial tubule guidance using tissue-engineered mimics of the mesenchyme and an existing FEM model and (2) Engineer nephron integration into dynamic tissue scaffolds through spatially guided differentiation, leveraging cell patterning, biochemical, and optogenetic approaches to direct the differentiation of early nephron lineages at many specific sites in tubule networks within dynamic scaffolds at once. The ability to mimic human kidney development beyond the level of a single nephron or tubule will finally create opportunities to study and develop therapies for congenital kidney diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their functional roles include mechanical strengthening, optical elements, and gravity or magnetic field sensing.  Optimized in hundreds of millions of years of evolution, organisms have achieved remarkable engineering feats such as high bone toughness at low weight, self-sharpening teeth, self-repair capability, and low energy footprint, sustainable syntheses.  Many of the hallmarks of biological crystal growth have yet to be reproduced in vitro: curving and/or branching single crystals, control over polymorph, use of amorphous precursors, and nm scale control of organic-inorganic composites.  This project investigates approaches to control the cooperative growth of single crystals in cell culture with the goal to quite literally grow materials with properties optimized for their intended use.  The biomineralization system in sea urchin serves as the platform for these studies.  The following specific tasks will be pursued to explore and develop the range and limits of bioengineering single crystal shape, connectivity, and larger composite structures by guided biological deposition: (1) Explore, by multi-dimensional live cell microscopy, cellular dynamics on micro-patterns to better understand phenomena of bridging between sticky patches, motility of cells on lectin patterns, and formation of branch and/or fusion sites.  (2) Characterize interplay of spicule mineral, organic matrix, and cellular machinery at key points in the spicule development, namely the initial deposit, linear spicules, branch sites, and joints.  (3) Overexpress and purify the endogenous signaling factor SpVEGF-3 as a universal inducer of spiculogenesis in primary mesenchyme cell (PMC) cultures, and explore immobilization of the VEGF to study its role as a chemo-attractant.  (4) Investigate spicule matrix protein sorting signals in PMCs and determine minimum signal peptide required to target proteins to the spicule compartment.  (5) Use fusion proteins to study spicule matrix, and attempt to influence polymorph selection by expression of exogenous polymorph switches such as Starmaker. <br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  The ability to grow novel functional materials at ambient temperatures from seawater could create entirely new approaches to sustainable materials synthesis.  In addition, the PI will expose freshmen and sophomores to sea urchin biomineralization and soft lithography in the context of new ?Discovery Lab? modules that are part of an entry-level materials science class.  From this class and through minority recruitment channels at centers such as the MRSEC and others, he will recruit undergraduate researchers for academic year and summer research projects.  Such students receive highly interdisciplinary training in bio-related areas (e.g. molecular biology, biochemistry, and cell culture) that will complement clean room training, photo and soft lithography, and materials characterization by cutting-edge techniques.  The project will continue to develop modules for the mobile lab jump-started with the previous award to carry aspects of this research to local high and middle schools.  In addition, a murder mystery activity that is being developed with the Chicago Botanic Garden will be adapted for use at the Shedd Aquarium.  Finally, the PI will leverage resources at Northwestern University to reach out to society at large through participation in a range of events that include lab tours and public lectures."

Much could be gained by developing a biotechnological alternative to bulk materials synthesis. In this proposal the PI will explore micro-patterned cell culture of sea urchin embryonic primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) as a means to guide the cellular machinery responsible for single crystal synthesis. In this way the project will take advantage of a fully capable synthetic engine and attempt to reprogram it. This will then provide the basis for investigating and ultimately reverse engineering it in vitro. The following specific tasks will be pursued to explore and develop the range and limits of engineering single crystal shape, connectivity, and larger composite structures by guided biological deposition: (1) Develop micro-patterning to control the placement of PMCs on a surface. In this way, guide the biological deposition of single calcite (CaCO3) crystals. In particular, establish pattern topography, adhesiveness, chemotaxis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and limiting cell numbers and densities. (2) Explore junction patterns to reproduce the biological tri-radiate branching or fusion of two individual single crystalline elements. Combine simple shapes and junctions for increasingly complex crystal shape and connectivity in 2D and 3D. (3) Further characterize the biological crystal growth machinery with respect to routes of mineral/protein trafficking, amorphous precursor phases, and amorphous-to crystalline transitions by a complementary suite of techniques including live cell imaging, IR and Raman microscopy, and electron microscopic imaging.  <br/><br/><br/>BROADER IMPACTS:  The proposed research promises a major advance in harnessing biosynthetic mineralization pathways to create useful ceramic structures.  The project also includes a thorough plan for integration of research and education.  The PI will develop a full quarter undergraduate course in biomineralization designed to train students in communications skills, expose them to professional peer review, and assess their analytical skills.  Students will disseminate the knowledge gained through an online, public access WIKI that will be written, reviewed, and edited by students.  A design competition will be held to develop new cell culture devices for guided crystal growth and thus draw students into questions actively researched in the PI?s laboratory and engage their engineering skills in a trans-disciplinary project.  Undergraduate research opportunities in the PI?s lab will provide highly interdisciplinary cross training in bio-related areas such as sea urchin husbandry, cell culture, and live cell imaging, and these activities will complement training in clean room photolithography and materials characterization by advanced imaging techniques. Outreach to high school students will be targeted to ethnically diverse neighborhoods of Chicago, Rogers Park, and Evanston. As all current graduate students in the lab are female, an especially focused projection of positive female role models will be achieved. In conjunction with high school science teachers, engineering and biomaterials class modules, visits on the Northwestern Campus, and a summer internship program will be organized.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"

Confocal microscopy will allow three-dimension<br/>reconstruction of the embryos.  Preliminary studies show that FAK is found<br/>in the thickening vegetal plate of blastula embryos, in primary mesenchyme<br/>cells migrating in the blastocoel, in secondary mesenchyme cells<br/>responsible for fusion of the archenteron with the oral plate, and in the<br/>thickening animal pole from which the pluteus arms extend. <br/><br/>     (2) The second goal will be to determine the functional role of FAK by<br/>microinjecting into embryos a construct of FAK that contains only the<br/>targeting domain.

This research focuses on understanding how cells adopt a specific cell fate as they traverse through the embryo. The cells within the early embryo turn on specific genes, in part, in response to chemical cues they receive from their neighboring cells. This project will discover how genes are controlled by a group of regulatory RNAs. These regulatory RNAs control the level of gene expressions of many genes in several cell types to ensure proper development. Thus, this work contributes to the fundamental understanding of animal development. The project includes education activities that are synergistic to the proposed research project. The first educational activity involves an outreach program at the Delaware Children's Museum where the PI and her students develop a mobile microscope for young children to conduct hands-on, exploratory activities. The second educational activity is to enhance the knowledge base of future early childhood teachers by instilling confidence in science teaching, and by supporting science curriculum development. Inexpensive smartphone microscope platforms are placed in the hands of student teachers to foster future use in their own classrooms. This project is integrated into research training of undergraduate and graduate students and courses taught at the University of Delaware. The proposed educational activities incorporate the PI's expertise in development biology, microscopy, and ongoing research collaborations.<br/>  <br/>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved regulatory RNA molecules that control a myriad of biological processes, including development. In early development, cell specification and pattern formation are controlled by cross-regulation of gene regulatory networks (GRN) and signaling pathways. Signaling morphogen gradients are critical regulators that need to be tightly controlled in order to ensure that the precise organization of the embryo is achieved. This project addresses the overarching hypothesis that miRNAs perform this critical regulatory function. Its goal is to understand how miRNAs integrate GRNs and signaling pathways to drive development. To accomplish this goal, this study uses the sea urchin to study complex developmental processes that are shared by a wide range of organisms. The sea urchin has an exceptionally well-studied GRN and most of its miRNA families consist of a single species, which makes it amenable to unique, powerful functional analysis. To determine the mechanisms by which miRNAs control cell fate specification and directed cell movement during early embryogenesis, the PI will determine regulatory mechanisms of a highly conserved microRNA, miR-31, in the skeletogenic primary mesenchyme cell (PMC) lineage. This project examines how miR-31 coordinately suppresses PMC GRN components and cross-regulates signaling pathways to drive PMC development, using proteomic, transcriptomic, imaging, embryo transplantation, and molecular approaches. Overall, this study will advance the field of miRNA research and contribute to the fundamental understanding of early developmental processes."

Dr. Harden's                 laboratory has focused on pattern formation during gastrulation in              a seemingly simple system, the sea urchin embryo, in order to                   discover general rules that all embryos use to produce patterned                structures during gastrulation.  Using experimental approaches that             are unique to this system, we have found that mesenchyme cells in               that sea urchin embryo form patterned structures in response to                 spatially localized target information in the ectoderm or                       underlying basal lamina.  This proposal is aimed at gaining a                   greater understanding of these target recognition events, using                 molecular biology, computer-enhanced imaging techniques, and                    classical embryology.  Specifically, this proposal seeks to answer              the following questions: (1) What is the nature of the interaction              between cells and their targets? (2) When and how do these targets              arise during development? (3) What is the molecular nature of these             targets? Our long term goal is to understand the rules that cells               use to interact with one another in a coordinated fashion to                    transform the structure of the embryo during gastrulation."

During this process, repeated cell divisions create an embryo composed of many cells. These cells gradually take on distinct functions and organize themselves into tissues and organs. Understanding development is of great scientific importance, as this is the process by which new generations of multicellular organisms arise. Moreover, during earth?s history, modifications to developmental programs have produced the diverse animal morphologies we see in nature. Lastly, failures of human development have profound societal impacts, and any appreciation of the causes of such dysregulation must begin with an understanding of the mechanisms that ordinarily operate during development. Remarkably, the entire blueprint for embryonic development is contained in the DNA sequence of the genome. A central challenge of modern biology is to explain how this genomic information is ?decoded? to control the process of embryogenesis. This research project addresses that question. It exploits new methods (and undergraduate researchers) for examining the physical structure of genomic DNA, for monitoring when and where in the embryo various genes are working, and for dissecting interactions among these genes. The work will shed light on the mechanisms by which the information contained in the genome is deciphered during the transformation of a single cell into an organism, and will form a foundation for development of a digital atlas of echinoderm development. <br/> <br/>A hallmark of animal development is the gradual emergence of anatomy, as represented by the many different cell types of the mature organism and their organization into distinct tissues and organs. The emergence of anatomy during embryonic development (morphogenesis) requires specialized cell and tissue behaviors that are driven by differential gene expression. Systems level approaches have revealed that programs of differential gene expression are controlled by complex networks of transcription factors and non-coding DNA sequences to which they bind. Such gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are powerful tools for analyzing the genetic control and evolution of development. To understand the genotype-to-phenotype transformation it will therefore be important to link GRNs to morphogenesis. The overarching goal of this work is to uncover the detailed architecture of a model GRN and elucidate its control of crucial downstream effectors that drive morphogenesis. It leverages a GRN that drives a suite of spectacular behaviors by skeleton-forming primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) of the sea urchin embryo. The project combines ?top-down? and ?bottom-up? approaches. The former uses gene knockdowns and gene expression profiling to elucidate the regulatory topology of the network. The latter uses chromatin accessibility profiling and eRNA analysis to identify cis-regulatory DNA sequences that control morphogenetic effector genes, and then applies transcription factor footprinting, mutagenesis, and transgenic reporter assays to dissect these sequences and bootstrap into the upstream network circuitry. Lastly, the project extends a successful gene knockdown screen to identify and characterize key morphogenetic effectors. With respect to Broader Impacts, this project involves undergraduate researchers, outreach to high school students and teachers, and the development of a digital atlas of echinoderm development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The genome projects of higher organisms have revealed that alternative splicing is an important mechanism underlying protein isoform and diversity. Dr. Bronstein seeks to gain a greater understanding of the role played by alternative splicing in a vertebrate heart developmental model. More specifically, this project will investigate regulatory mechanisms involved in the alternative splicing process that underlies isoform diversity of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFRs) during early chicken cardiogenesis. FGFRs are important in regulating the differentiation of embryonic tissue either into epithelia or mesenchyme depending upon which FGFR isoform is expressed. Dr. Bronstein is interested in the role of the heterogeneous nuclear<br/>ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNP A1 or A1) and its interactions in determining the splice choice selection of FGFR isoforms. A1, a trans-acting splicing silencer and shuttle protein found in the core protein complex of the spliceosome, is expressed in many organ systems in a cell-specific manner. In the case of heart development, she hypothesizes that A1 may be involved in the alternative splicing of FGFR2. Thus, she proposes to study the spatial and temporal coordination of A1 expression as well as its post-transcriptional control. She hypothesize that A1 determines splice choice selection of the high affinity ligand-binding IIIc isoform of FGFR2 and is involved in cardiogenesis. By developing a system for modifying FGFR signaling via A1 manipulation, she will gain<br/>a greater understanding of the role of alternative splicing in heart development.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This project will both allow the PI to develop as an independent<br/>researcher and enable underrepresented undergraduate students at Mercy College the opportunity to participate in original and potentially publishable, hypothesis-driven research.

As a developmental biologist with an interest in conducting research in molecular genetics of vertebrate development, the PI would bring a broad research and training experience to our diverse cohort of undergraduate students, thus exposing them to advanced molecular biology, biochemical and analytical techniques. As a mechanism for integrating research and education, we also intend to introduce the assays she develops into her upper level classes so that other students not actively engaged in our research project will be exposed to these state-of-the-art methods. Thus, this project will broaden the participation of individuals from underrepresented groups in the areas of the biological sciences supported by the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences thereby enabling her students to pursue their goals of obtaining advanced degrees and giving the opportunity to PI in becoming an independent researcher.<br/><br/>"

In all vertebrate embryos, PD primordia must extend from the pronephros to the cloaca in order to form the functional conduit for excretory waste. PD tissue is also required to induce terminal differentiation of larval and adult kidney forms; if PD tissue does not appear in the nephrogenic mesenchyme in the right place at the right time, kidney agenesis results.  Although PD extension appears superficially similar in all vertebrates, careful analysis reveals that the cellular basis of PD elongation is different in different animals. The studies proposed here will use tissue extirpation, transplantation and fate-mapping to compare PD extension in Xenopus laevis and Ambystoma mexicanum embryos with a focus on understanding the Xenopus<br/>system as well as we do Ambystoma. In addition, molecular analysis of the Ret protein tyrosine kinase signaling system, known to be important for PD cell migration in Ambystoma, will be initiated in Xenopus laevis embryos.<br/><br/>Intellectual merit:<br/>Despite the fact that PD elongation is the central event in establishing the vertebrate excretory system, little is known about the cell and tissue behaviors that lead to its morphogenesis. However, understanding these behaviors is essential to the informed interpretation of molecular studies. Therefore, the experiments proposed here will help provide a phenomenological context for the growing number of genetic studies of pronephric system development in amphibians, as well as provide a comparative basis for studies of PD extension in other vertebrate groups. Thus, the proposed studies will provide the developmental biology community with fundamental information about excretory system development and evolution.<br/><br/>Broader impacts:<br/>The proposed activities will be conducted by the PI and undergraduates at Rider University. Rider's student demographic includes 19% underrepresented minorities, 25% first-generation college students and 60% women.

Furthermore, most of the students performing independent research in her lab have the opportunity to present their work at regional or national scientific meetings. All graduates from her laboratory have pursued science-related careers. The PI's synergistic activities include K-12 science education outreach and curriculum development.  In sum, the broader impact of the PI's professional activities include the advancement of discovery while promoting teaching, training and learning; broadening the participation of<br/>underrepresented groups; and, through integration of her research into her undergraduate courses and expanding her undergraduate audience to include K-12 education majors, broad dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding.<br/><br/>"

An  understanding of cell-cell interactions in the early embryo  will require not only an analysis of the molecular basis of  the signaling, but also an understanding of the cellular  context of such interactions within the embryo.  With these  goals in mind, the proposed research program involves an  integration of cellular and molecular methodologies.  The  P.I. will apply these experimental strategies to the  developing sea urchin embryo, a manipulable, optically  transparent experimental system.  He plans to focus on a key  regulatory interaction that occurs between the two principal  populations of mesodermal cells in the embryo, primary and  secondary mesenchyme cells (PMCs and SMCs).  PMCs transmit a  signal during gastrulation that suppresses the skeletogenic  potential of SMCs and directs these cells into an  alternative developmental program.  This interaction plays  an important role in the specification of SMC fates and the  process of skeletogenesis, and serves as a model system to  study embryonic regulation and cell signalling in the early  embryo.  Three key aspects of the PMC-SMC interaction are to  be addressed:  (1) the development of new methods for  studying the dynamics of cell fate-switching in living  embryos; (2) the properties and molecular basis of PMC  signaling; and (3) the properties of the responding SMCs.  The proposed research will significantly advance our  understanding of a central issue in developmental biology.  In addition, this research program will continue to support  the training and development of young developmental  biologists at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral  levels."

As part of this effort, new non-                        destructive methods of light microscopy are devised and applied                 to analyze the dynamic changes of fine structure, directly in                   living cells.

Craniofacial variation has important implications for diet, defense, posture, balance, hearing, vision, and the accommodation of the expanding primate brain.  The skull is a complex adaptive structure, and the question naturally arises pertaining to the genetic mechanisms that assemble and coordinate its shape.  This project will determine whether variation in head shape occurs along similar anatomical axes among living monkeys and apes, their fossil ancestors, a pedigree of 800 extant baboons, and in laboratory mice.  Computerized tomography (CT) scans will be acquired from these heads and used to measure variation in three dimensions.  The genes responsible for this variation will be identified using data from baboon and mouse.  Developmental pathways are shared among mammals, so mice provide an important comparative and experimental basis for primate findings.  The manner by which genes structure variation in head shape will be investigated by combined comparative DNA sequence and bioinformatic analysis, and by engineering similar changes in mice to those seen in baboons.  Many genes doubtlessly contribute to structures like the head, and a general challenge to modern evolutionary and developmental genetics generally is to understand whether some genes are repeatedly involved in similar changes in complex traits over the millions of years and different branches of evolution, or whether different genes in the shared developmental pathways are responsible in each instance.<br/><br/>The project will generate a large amount of data which will be posted on a publicly accessible website along with information on analytical approaches and results.  The PIs have a strong record of training women and minority students and they will continue this tradition at all levels from undergraduate to postdoctoral.  Human evolutionary studies have a strong public appeal and this project will be exceptionally popular to the public media."
