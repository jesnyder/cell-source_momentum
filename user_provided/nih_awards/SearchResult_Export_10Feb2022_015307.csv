Development of the endocrine pancreas includes a series of early events wherein precursor cells migrate as mesenchymal cells to form epithelial aggregates that subsequently differentiate into islets of Langerhans. We use primarily cells derived from human cadaveric pancreata, human islet-derived precursor cells (hIPCs) and CD73/CD90/CD105-positive mesenchymal stem cells (+++MSCs), to study MET and EMT. We have established novel cell culture systems of hIPCs and +++MSCs that allows for proliferation of these precursor cells for at least 30 generations. We have shown that the proliferating hIPCs can be induced to transition to epithelial cells that subsequently differentiate into insulin-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the proliferating state of hIPCs is dependent on the -catenin signaling pathway.  When -catenin signaling is down-regulated, hIPCs no longer proliferate.  In our studies of transplanting hIPC clusters under the kidney capsules of NOD/SCID mice, we noted that there were mesenchymal-like cells present within the transplants.  Since this is important in that it may represent de-differentiation of the endocrine/epithelial cells, we have been studying this phenomenon in vitro.  We have found that epithelial cell clusters (ECCs) formed from hIPCs can transition back to cells exhibiting a mesenchymal phenotype.  Thus, regulation of MET, an initial step in differentiation toward beta cells, and EMT of ECCs is an important site of control for the use of hIPCs for cell replacement therapy.  We have found that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulate hIPC EMT (and proliferation).  We are pursuing studies to better understand these processes.  Preliminary reports of these findings have been presented at two international meetings.","301723",

Transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR)is one such method that employs the use of a high powered laser to create a controlled injury and engender the natural angiogenic response.  While clinical results with two different wavelengths of laser light are reportedly similar there are vast differences between the laser tissue interactions.  We investigated whether this difference led to a myocardial functional change and whether the mechanisms whereby each laser achieves its clinical success is different.
Employing a porcine model of chronic myocardial ischemia; cine MRI, hyperenhancement MRI, rest and stress echocardiography and histology were performed after TMR.  There were significant improvements in myocardial function after treatment by a carbon dioxide that were not seen when a holmium:YAG device was used.  Histology and MRI confirmed more scarrring and less angiogenesis with the Ho:YAG device at 6 weeks post treatment.
Building on these results we have embarked on the addition of cellular therapy to further enhance the angiogenic response engendered by the laser.  Using autologous bone marrow which has been allowed to differentiate and expand, mesenchymal stem cells are injected into the ischemic zone of the aforementioned large animal model.  MRI, echo and histologic endpoints are being gathered to determine if a synergistic response is possible.","366011",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) induce bone formation during development and postnatal bone repair. Demineralized bone matrix (DBM) is the initial osteoinductive material for the isolation and purification of BMPs. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the initial cellular sequence and repair tissues induced by DBM/BMPs are distinctly different in the calvarial bone defects from those induced in the soft tissue sites. DBM-induced repair of rat calvarial defect  
occurs initially by the differentiation of dura-derived mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts and the direct formation of bone. In contrast, implantation of DBM into subcutaneous sites first induces cartilage cells followed by an endochondral sequence of ossification. The molecular and cellular mechanisms of site-specific differences in repair responses to DBM/BMPs are unknown. More recently, we have discovered that one member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factors family, NFATp (NFATc2), may be a represser of cartilage cell differentiation in adult mice. In adult mice lacking NFATp, resident cells in the extraarticular connective tissues spontaneously differentiate to cartilage followed by an endochondral sequence of ossification. To our knowledge, NFATp is the first transcription factor described to control the differentiation of adult mesenchymal stem cells into cartilage. This is in contrast to the function of the cartilagespecific transcription factor Sox 9, which is critical in embryonic cartilage morphogenesis. In this application we wish to explore whether transcription factor NFATp regulates the differentiation pathways of adult mesenchymal stem cells during DBM-induced repair of cranial defects in mice. We propose 1) to detect whether NFATp expression is higher at the cranial site of normal mice, which suppresses the chondrogenic pathway at the cranial site, and 2) to determine whether lack of NFATp will alter DBM-induced bone differentiation pathways and the healing process during the repair of cranial defects. Acquiring such understanding may provide novel insight into the mechanisms of site-dependent responses to DBM/BMP implants and could possibly lead to improved therapeutic methods for the repair of skeletal tissues.

to avoid growth disturbance and resulting deformity. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that reside in the
marrow spaces adjacent to the physis are responsible for healing the injuries. MSCs are pluriopotent cells
that can differentiate to cartilage, bone or fat tissue based on conditions. Recent evidence has shown that
local oxygen availability alters the differentiation of MSCs with hypoxic conditions favoring chondrogenesis.
Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) is a key mechanism for sensing and responding to changes in oxygen.
Therefore, we hypothesize that local oxygen tension alters MSC differentiation via the HIF-1 pathway.
In Aim 1, we will test this hypothesis by determining the effects of hypoxia and altered HIF-1 on MSC
differentiation in vitro. Primary mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from murine bone marrow will be grown
in conditions favoring bone or cartilage differentiation and exposed to normoxia or hypoxia. Differentiation
will be assessed by gene expression (real time PCR) and by phenotypic expression of bone
(mineralization) or cartilage (proteoglycans). Similarly, MSCs from mice with conditional mutations to
increase HIF-1 activity (Von Hippel Lindau deletion) or decrease HIF-1 activity (HIF-1 deletion) will then be
grown in osteogenic or chondrogenic conditions. To test whether the HIF-1 pathway impinges on
differentiation to bone or cartilage, the cells will be exposed to normoxia or hypoxia and genotypic and
phenotypic expression of bone or cartilage markers will be examined.
In Aim 2, we will use an in vivo mouse model to evaluate MSC differentiation in healing of a surgically
created defect across the physis that connects the epiphyseal and metaphyseal marrow spaces, altering
local nutrient availability. The injury results in healing with a bony bridge formed by intramembranous
ossification. Injuries will be imaged by CT and SPECT, detailed histology will be performed, and gene
expression associated with hypoxia, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis will be evaluated by real time PCR
of the zone of injury.
In Aim 3, we propose a future direction for development of an inducible mutation targeted to MSC's driven
by the dermol or prxl promoter. This will allow manipulation of the HIF-1 pathway (or other desired target)
in MSC's prior to differentiation in order to alter the healing response with the goal of preventing bone
formation and the resulting growth disturbance."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cellular adaptation to low oxygen (hypoxia) is an important biological problem not only in relation to pathological conditions such as cancer and ischemic diseases, but also in normal fetal development and in cell differentiation. Our studies have shown that chondrocytes are an excellent model to learn how cells adapt to, and differentiate in a low oxygen environment. The fetal growth plate is a unique mesenchymal tissue since it is avascular, though it requires the angiogenic switch in order to be replaced by bone. We have recently demonstrated that the fetal growth plate has an out-in gradient of oxygenation with a central, hypoxic region. Moreover, we have discovered that the transcription factor Hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (Hif-1a), which is a major mediator of the cellular adaptation to hypoxia, controls critical steps of endochondral bone development. Our work thus far, in fact, suggests that the actions of Hif-1a are central to the regulation of survival and differentiation of chondrocytes; this renewal, will endeavor to understand these vital roles of Hif-1a. Chondrocytes lacking Hif-1a undergo massive cell death, particularly in the center of the developing growth plate. Hif-1a is thus a survival factor, at least for cells of mesenchymal origin such as chondrocytes. Notably, in the fetal growth plate this ""central cell death phenotype"" is mimicked by genetic ablation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGF), a direct downstream target of Hif-1a. To start dissecting out the molecular mechanisms downstream of Hif-1a as a survival factor, in Aim I of this grant proposal, we will investigate whether VEGF is able to rescue, at least in part, the loss of cell viability observed in fetal growth plate deficient in Hif-1a, and we will thus gain further insights into the role of VEGF as one of the mediators of the survival function of Hif-1a in the fetal growth plate. Detailed analysis of an in vivo loss-of-function model of Hif-1a in cartilage has provided strong evidence that this transcription factor has also non-redundant functions in controlling differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes, as lack of Hif-1a in limb bud mesenchyme considerably delays the formation of the cartilaginous primordia. In addition, preliminary data have shown that hypoxia and Hif-1a regulate terminal stages of chondrocyte differentiation. Collectively, these findings suggest that low oxygen tension, far from being detrimental, is 'required' for formation of cartilage, by up regulating Hif-1a transcriptional activity. In Aim II, we will study the essential role of Hif-1a in chondrocyte differentiation, and we will test the hypothesis that hypoxia and Hif-1a regulate expression of prolyl-4-hydroxylase II, which controls post-translational hydroxylation of collagens in chondrocytes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. If successful this proposal will significantly advance our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the cellular adaptation to hypoxia and the differentiation process of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes. Thus, its relevance is high for both organogenesis and mesenchymal stem cell biology.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
Loss of skin barrier function can dramatically increase morbidity and mortality from radiation exposure in a nuclear accident, attack, or terrorist incident. Skin damage can be the result of radiation-induced acute desquamation and/or dermal damage that is normally expressed late but can be precipitated by physical trauma, burns, or penetrating wounds. In extensive experiments, we showed that skin irradiation compromises wound healing, but perhaps more importantly whole body radiation exposure seriously impacts the healing process by depleting circulating bone marrow- derived cells. Quantitative assays of wound tensile strength showed that moderate doses of 4-7Gy to the whole body were equivalent to 15-20Gy to the skin. There are many radiation scenarios where whole body radiation exposure will compromise the skin healing process, which cannot be considered as a skin only issue. We showed that implants of mesenchymal cells could correct radiation-induced dermal deficits. This approach is however limited by the fact that only a small percent of the implanted cells remaine in the site to be active and those that do have to be capable of extensive proliferation i.e. to be mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). To overcome these limitations, we developed techniques to rapidly and selectively isolate MSCs from varying sources based on the finding that they adhere to multiple homologous C-terminal peptides on ¿- and ?-chains of fibrin(ogen), termed haptides. We made fibrin microbeads (FMBs) that are far superior to conventional techniques for the isolation, purification, and proliferation of MSCs allowing high cell numbers to be obtained rapidly for implantation. Furthermore, FMBs are biodegradable and are therefore excellent vehicles for delivering MSCs into incisions in radiation-compromised skin and keeping them viable and proliferating in the site. We also developed haptized collagen sponge sheets to support MSCs and that are a better choice for delivering MSCs to areas of radiation-induced moist desquamation. FMBs and haptized collagen sheets will be used to compare bone marrow-derived and G-CSF-mobilized MSCs for their ability to heal radiation-compromised skin incisions and areas of moist desquamation. The influence of whole body radiation exposure on skin healing will be examined to mimic the likely reality in an accidental or terrorist event. Syngeneic MSCs will be compared with allogeneic MSCs, since that latter can be more readily available in an emergency situation. In addition, the influence of G-CSF and GM- CSF treatment, which are likely to be used in a radiation exposure setting, will be tested. Effectiveness will be assessed using highly quantitative or semi-quantitative measures to establish dose-modifying factors, with findings confirmed by histology.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is generally believed that there are two types of stem cells in the bone marrow, i.e. hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal (MSCs) and that their repertoire of differentiation/reconstituting potentials are distinct and separate from each other. HSCs have been shown to produce blood cells and some cells in the tissues such as mast cells and osteoclasts. MSCs are thought to be responsible for a number of mesenchymal cells including fibroblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes and osteocytes. Recently, studies have begun to question the distinction between the potentials of HSCs and MSCs. For example, transplantation of 3000 side population (SP) cells that are highly enriched for HSCs generated osteoblasts in vivo. Also in a transplantation study using retrovirally transduced bone marrow cells, a close relationship was suggested by a common retroviral integration site in clonogenic hematopoietic cells and osteoprogenitors from each of the recipient mice. In our laboratory, by transplanting clonal cells derived from single HSCs, we have documented that a number of tissue fibroblasts/myofibroblasts such as glomerular mesangial cells, brain microglial cells, fibroblasts in cardiac valve and tumor-associated fibroblasts are derived from HSCs. We have also documented that fibroblast colony-forming units (CFU-F), which had been thought to be progenitors for mesenchymal cells, are also derived from HSCs. Most recently, we succeeded in generating adipocytes in vitro from the bone marrow cells of mice that had been clonally engrafted with single HSCs and directly from single hematopoietic progenitors. We also made a preliminary observation of osteocytes in vivo in the bones of mice that had been clonally engrafted for 10 months. Together, these observations suggest that some mesenchymal cell types are not derived solely from the MSC. In this application, we propose to investigate the potential of the HSC to give rise to fibroblasts, adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes in vitro and in vivo under both normal and pathological conditions.  
  
Project Narrative: Studies described in this application are likely to elucidate hitherto unknown reconstitution potentials of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells, i.e. abilities to generate fat tissues, bones and cartilages. The knowledge gained from these studies will allow subsequent development of new, unique avenues of therapy for obesity and diseases of bones and joints.

The relationship between airway inflammation and remodeling has remained uncertain; but there is
evidence that corticosteroid therapy does not prevent the development of airway remodeling. Thus, there is
a major impetus to understand the pathogenesis of airway remodeling at a more fundamental level. One of
the critical components of airway remodeling is the generation of myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts contribute
both to the enhanced deposition of matrix protein including types I and III collagens as well as to the
contractile apparatus. Relatively little is known about the origin of myofibroblasts involved in asthma. Three
potential sources of airway myofibroblasts are activation of resident lung fibroblasts, recruitment of bone
marrow fibroblast stem cells that differentiate into fibroblasts and transition or transdifferentiation of airway
epithelial cell into myofibroblasts. Studies in other organs, particularly the kidney, have shown that epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a major source of myofibroblasts following injury or trauma. Our
hypothesis is that airway epithelial cells in chronic asthma establish a local milieu that promotes transition of
epithelial cells to myofibroblasts, and that this represents a significant component of airway remodeling. An
important corollary of this hypothesis is that changing the local milieu can promote myofiblast to epithelial
transition, and thereby improve remodeling.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1: Assess the mechanisms underlying
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in airway epithelial cells; 2) Analyze the regulation of epithelialmesenchymal
transition in airway epithelial cells; and 3) Explore the relationship between epithelialmesenchymal
transition and in vivo airway remodeling in patients with chronic asthma.
These studies will directly address a fundamental mechanism by which the airway may undergo
remodeling during chronic asthma. Because the pathways leading to epithelial to mesenchymal transition
are subject to regulation by current and future medications, defining the molecular steps in the process of
transition will provide guidance for future efforts to limit remodeling. Finally, development of a biomarker for
remodeling will significantly enhance the ability to monitor these therapeutic efforts."," ",

Development of the endocrine pancreas includes a series of early events wherein precursor cells migrate to form aggregates that subsequently differentiate into islets of Langerhans. We use cells derived from human cadaveric pancreata, human islet-derived precursor cells (hIPCs) and CD73/CD90/CD105-positive mesenchymal stem cells (+++MSCs), and a human pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC-1 cells) to study regulation of proliferation, cell migration and aggregation that precede differentiation and differentiation itself.  1) We have now demonstrated that hIPCs are pancreatic MSCs that can differentiate in vitro and in vivo into hormone-expressing cells of the endocrine pancreas.  Indeed, we have provided preliminary evidence that bona fide MSCs reside in the pancreas in situ,  2) We showed that hIPCs, and preliminarily +++MSCs, exhibit epigenetic marks that are associated with active gene transcription on the insulin gene even though they are not actively transcribing this gene.  This most likely represents a state of commitment for these stem cells to differentiate further to mature endocrine cells.  3) We showed that signaling via the -catenin pathway is critical for proliferation of hIPCs.  This pathway may, therefore, be an important target for regulation of the switch from mesenchymal cell proliferation to differentiation to endocrine cells.  4) We showed that the plasminogen/plasmin pathway is capable of regulating PANC-1 cell aggregation that is an early stage in differentiation of these cells into endocrine cells.","603446",

number of bone-forming osteoblasts, increased number of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, and increased number of
fat cells, adipocytes, in the bone marrow. Osteoblasts and adipocytes originate from marrow-derived
mesenchymal stroma/stem cells (MSCs). The milieu of intracellular and extracellular signals controls MSC lineage
allocation. Emerging evidence indicates that the adipocyte-specific transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-y)acts as a positive regulator of marrow adipocyte formation and negative
regulator of osteoblast development. In vivo, increased activity of PPAR-y leads to bone loss, similar to bone loss
with aging, whereas its decreased activity results in increased bone mass. The pro-adipocytic and the anti-
osteoblastic properties of PPAR-y are determined by the type of ligand and can be distinguished, suggesting
separate mechanisms by which PPAR-y controls bone mass and fat mass in bone. During aging, the status of
MSCs changes with respect to both their intrinsic differentiation potential and production of signaling molecules
that contribute to the formation of a specific marrow micro-environment. The expression of PPAR-yand
production of its natural activators (e.g., oxidized fatty acids) increases, suggesting increased activity of this
nuclear receptor. Increased activity of PPAR-^y down-regulates the expression and activity of multiple regulatory
pathways, including Wnt, TGF-p, and IGF-1, suggesting the role of this transcription factor in the regulation of the
extrinsic signaling milieu. We propose that age-related bone loss results from the increased anti-osteoblastic
activity of PPAR-y, which results in both intrinsic changes in the differentiation of MSCs and a decrease
in pro-osteoblastic signaling in the marrow micro-environment. The following Specific Aims will test this
hypothesis: Aim 1: Determine regulatory mechanisms by which PPAR-y2 suppresses osteoblast
differentiation during aging. Aim 2: Determine the effects of PPAR-y-controlled intracellular mechanisms
and microenvironmental changes on bone formation with the model of distraction osteogenesis (DO).
An understanding of the effects of aging on the interrelationship between MSC differentiation potential and
the modulatory effects of the bone marrow environment on this process is the starting point for the
development of successful therapies for osteoporosis that will specifically target bone and bone marrow
stem cells. Completion of the above aims should enable us to determine the role of PPAR-y in this process
and will allow designing therapeutic interventions that will selectively block PPAR-y anti-osteoblastic activity.","58327",

Proteomics, which entails global gene expression analysis, is considered a
nonbiased discovery-driven (as opposed to hypothesis-driven) approach to the
analysis of protein expression. The long-term objective of the proposed
research is to determine the role of human bone marrow (BM) stromal cells in
normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. This proposal aims to: (1) Carry forward a
critical previous discovery that shows that human BM stromal cells represent a
unique pluridifferentiated mesenchymal progenitor cell type (MPC),
coexpressing multiple mesenchymal lineage markers. (2) Apply a recently
established method for purifying MPCs from leukemic BM stromal cell cultures,
free of macrophages and hematopoietic cells. (3) Investigate MPC cell-specific
protein expression profiles and how these profiles change in hematopoietic
malignancies. (4) Establish the proof of principle and practice of
high-resolution proteomics with relevance to normal and leukemic human BM
stromal cells. Specific experimental design includes performance of the
following. R21 Phase: Set up large-format 2-D gel electrophoretic system (2-D
PAGE) for reproducible separation of MPC proteins. Prepare 2-D PAGE protein
maps for normal BM-derived MPCs (untreated and treated with representative
cytokines) and for MPCs derived from patients with representative leukemic
conditions (AML, CML, MM). Using mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS and/or Nano ESI
MS/MS), identify about 200 differentially-expressed MPC proteins (i.e., those
that increased or decreased in intensity as compared to 2-D PAGE protein maps
of normal, unstimulated MPCs). Construct a human BM MPC-2DPAGE database on WWW
and publish it under WORLD-2DPAGE with links to the currently existing 2-D
PAGE databases. In parallel studies, identify about 200 differentially
expressed MPC proteins by an independent method, isotope-coded affinity tag
(ICAT) labeling in conjunction with LC/MS/MS. Based on theoretical pI and MW, construct a ""virtual"" 2-D map of ICAT-identified MPC proteins for integration
into 2-D PAGE database. R33 Phase: Add high-throughput robotics to the
high-resolution 2-D PAGE proteomics established under R21 phase. Identify on a
relatively large-scale (about 1,800) the MPC proteins that are differentially
expressed following stimulation with different cytokines and in leukemias
(AML, CML, MM). Facilitate understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms by
identifying the phosphoproteins potentially involved in cell signaling
pathways. In parallel studies, identity about 1,800 MPC proteins by ICAT
method. We plan to identify a total of about 2,000 functionally relevant BM
stromal cell proteins by each method. Update the WWW database by including the
proteins with pathologically altered expression. The database will be a
valuable resource for researchers investigating the basic biology of
hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis and for clinical hematologists/oncologists
and pathologists alike.","485894",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overexpression of zinc finger homeodomain 1 (Zeb1) triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by repressing key epithelial specialization genes, including E-cadherin. By contrast, mutation of Zeb1 leads to mesenchymal-epithelial transition with ectopic expression of epithelial genes. Mutation of Zeb1 in patients is linked to epithelization of corneal endothelium and posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD). Mice null for Zeb1 exhibit PPCD characteristics late in embryogenesis, whereas such pathologic changes are delayed until adulthood in heterozygous mice. Overexpression of Zeb1 occurs in dedifferentiation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, an EMT characterized by ectopic proliferation, loss of pigment and transition to fibroblastic morphology. Such RPE dedifferentiation contributes to proliferative vitreoretinopathy, the major complication in retinal detachment. Heterozygous mutation of Zeb1 prevents RPE dedifferentiation. We propose a series of experiments to begin examining the molecular basis for Zeb1 function in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal balance in eye cells. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epithelial vs. mesenchymal balance is crucial for normal tissue formation in development, and this balance is disrupted in eye diseases such as posterior corneal dystrophies and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. We provide evidence that the zinc finger E-box binding homeodomain1 (Zeb1) is important in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal balance in corneal endothelium and retinal pigmented epithelium.

Bone-forming osteoblasts are
derived from multipotent human mesenchymal progenitor cells (hMPCs). Cell senescence is an irreversible
proliferation arrest that prevents unlimited rounds of cell division. Shortened chromosome telomeres,
resulting from multiple rounds of cell proliferation, are one trigger of senescence. By arresting cell
proliferation, senescence is thought to prevent indefinite tissue renewal, and so contribute to tissue aging.
Also, cell senescence inhibits osteogenesis (bone differentiation) in vitro. In sum, senescence may disrupt
cycles of adult bone resorption and deposition, contributing to declining bone mass with age.
Recently, my lab has shown that a complex of histone chaperones, including HIRA and ASFla, is responsible
for remodeling chromatin structure in senescent cells. Our recent data indicate that the HIRA/ASFla pathway
contributes to both senescence and osteogenic differentiation of hMPCs. We will investigate the role of the
HIRA/ASF la pathway in differentiation of hMPCs along the osteogenic lineage and its contribution to bone
formation in vivo, in addition, we will ask how senescence inhibits osteogenesis in vitro, whether senescent
mesenchymal cells accumulate in prematurely-aged osteoporotic bone and assess the impact of HIRA/ASFla
on this osteoporotic phenotype. We will also address the osteogenic function of a new-found member of the
HIRA/ASFla complex, a protein called Ubnl.
In collaboration with the other projects, this project will: utilize a novel X-ray structure of the HIRA/Ubnl
histone chaperone complex, generated in Project 1, to dissect the role of that complex in osteogenic
differentiation; interact with Project 2 through functional analysis of the yeast orthologs of HIRA and Ubnl;
and, in collaboration with Project 3, investigate the contribution of short telomere-induced cellular senescence
to age-dependent osteoporosis in the mouse, and the impact of HIRA and ASFla on this. In sum, Project 4
rounds off the program project, and applies the structural and genetic discoveries from Projects 1-3 to an
aspect of mammalian tissue aging."," ",

Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) are an important cellular component of the bone marrow
microenvironment as progenitor cells of multiple mesenchymal phenotypes including osteoblasts,
chondrocytes, adipocytes and marrow stromal fibroblasts and potentially other mesenchymal phenotypes
(Figure 1). MSCs make a large array of cytokines, prostaglandins, extracellular matrix molecules and cell
surface receptors and have been reported to support the differentiation and expansion of hematopoietic
progenitors in vitro.

The Cell Core will serve as a centralized technical and dispensing facility, dedicated to producing MSCs using Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) to insure that the research projects will be conducted with the same high quality MSC 
preparations.  In addition, the Cell Core Facility will conduct quality control assays including the screening, selection and 
procurement of specialized reagents needed for the isolation and expansion procedures. In particular, the fetal
bovine serum used in the culture-expansion medium must be carefully screened and selected. Finally, the Cell
Core Facility will conduct experimentation to optimize the chondrogenic potential of the cell preparations to be
supplied to the Program Investigators. These experiments will be designed to validate preliminary data
obtained with human MSCs. The services to be provided by the Cell Core Facility are summarized by the
following specific aims.

SpecificAim 1: To provide high quality Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) and chondrocyte cultures,
customized to the needs of each Research Project, in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Specific Aim 2: To optimize animal cell preparations and culture systems for chondrogenesis.

Specific Aim 2a: To assess the effect of FGF-2 supplementation during mitotic expansion on the
chondrogenic potential of rabbit MSCs and chondrocytes

Specific Aim 2b: To study the role of TGF-p1 in the regulation of hypertrophic differentiation of rabbit
MSCs and chondrocytes.

It is important to stress here, that while parts of this document focus on human MSCs (hMSCs), the
contribution of this Core to the overall Research Program is to deliver rabbit bone marrow-derived MSCs and
rabbit chondrocytes from different anatomical locations to grant participants and collaborators and to develop
optimized culture conditions for expansion and chondrogenic differentiation of these cells.

The standard operating protocols and procedures (SOPs) for these preparations are in hand as are the
SOPs for chondrocytes from a variety of human and animal cartilages; these are also expected to be used by
participants and collaborators. Drs. Solchaga (12 years), Caplan (38 years), Lennon (25 years) and
Haynesworth (13 years) have over 88 years of combined experience with mesenchymal progenitor cells,
chondrocytes and osteoblasts in culture and will provide uniform, reproducible cell preparations for the users of
the Core Laboratory."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Bone loss with aging results from attenuated and unbalanced bone turnover, and is associated with a decreased number of bone-forming osteoblasts, increased number of bone-resorbing osteoclasts, and increased number of fat cells, adipocytes, in the bone marrow. Osteoblasts and adipocytes originate from marrow-derived mesenchymal stroma/stem cells (MSCs). The milieu of intracellular and extracellular signals controls MSC lineage allocation. Emerging evidence indicates that the adipocyte-specific transcription factor peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-gamma (PPARg) acts as a positive regulator of marrow adipocyte formation and negative regulator of osteoblast development. In vivo, increased activity of PPARg leads to bone loss, similar to bone loss with aging, whereas its decreased activity results in increased bone mass. The pro-adipocytic and the anti- osteoblastic properties of PPARg are determined by the type of ligand and can be distinguished, suggesting separate mechanisms by which PPARg controls bone mass and fat mass in bone. During aging, the status of MSCs changes with respect to both their intrinsic differentiation potential and production of signaling molecules that contribute to the formation of a specific marrow micro-environment. The expression of PPARg and production of its natural activators (e.g., oxidized fatty acids) increases, suggesting increased activity of this nuclear receptor. Increased activity of PPARg down-regulates the expression and activity of multiple regulatory pathways, including Wnt, TGF-beta, and IGF-1, suggesting the role of this transcription factor in the regulation of the extrinsic signaling milieu. We propose that age-related bone loss results from the increased anti-osteoblastic activity of PPARg, which results in both intrinsic changes in the differentiation of MSCs and a decrease in pro-osteoblastic signaling in the marrow micro-environment. The following Specific Aims will test this hypothesis: Aim 1: Determine regulatory mechanisms by which PPARg suppresses osteoblast differentiation during aging. Aim 2: Determine the effects of PPAR-g controlled intracellular mechanisms and microenvironmental changes on bone formation with the model of distraction osteogenesis (DO). An understanding of the effects of aging on the interrelationship between MSC differentiation potential and the modulatory effects of the bone marrow environment on this process is the starting point for the development of successful therapies for osteoporosis that will specifically target bone and bone marrow stem cells. Completion of the above aims should enable us to determine the role of PPARg in this process and will allow designing therapeutic interventions that will selectively block PPARg anti-osteoblastic activity.

Medicine. The principal investigator has completed a clinical/research fellowship in Pulmonary and Critical
Care at Boston University, and is now transitioning to a career as an independent investigator. Alan
Fine.M.D. will mentor the principal investigator's scientific development. Dr Fine is a recognized leader in
lung biology, and has extensive experience training post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students. To ensure
the Aims of this proposal are met the principal investigator has enlisted the expertise of Ken Walsh, PhD,
and has put together a team of advisors that include Wellington Cardoso,MD, PhD, a recognized leader in
lung development, and Dr Peter Quesenberry, an expert in stem cell biology. The overall objective of this
proposal is to study a newly identified cell type isolated from the embryonic murine lung that has features of
a mesenchymal stem/progenitor. These cells lack characteristics of mature mesenchymal cells, and can
differentiate to smooth muscle, fat and cartilage during culture. While the overall frequency, and specific
phenotype of these cells has yet to be determined, immuno-phenotyping data has localized these cells to the
CD45(-),cytokeratin(-),CD31(-) SP cell fraction of the lung. Notably, the molecular mechanisms maintaining
these cells in an undifferentiated state are unknown; however, our pilot data suggest a role for the Foxo
subfamily of transcription factors. These findings have led us to the following hypothesis: Contained with the
embryonic lung are mesenchymal stem cells. These cells reside within the CD45(-)cytokeratin(-)CD31(-) SP
fraction, have a unique phenotype, serve as precursors to differentiated mesenchymal cell types, and their
state of differentiation is regulated by the Foxo subfamily of transcription factors. To test this we propose to:
1. Identify the cells contained within the embryonic lung that possess mesenchymal stem/progenitor activity.
2. Evaluate the in vivo capacity of these cells to differentiate to mature lung mesenchymal cell types.
3. Further explore the role of the Foxo subfamily in controlling the differentiation state of these cells.
 Together this proposal, coupled with the rich scientific environment offered at Boston University are
designed to enable the principal investigator to meet the objectives outlined, advance his scientific
background, and establish a career as an independent investigator.","128310",

We are investigating the use of mesenchymal stem cells in repopulation of lung tissues in macaques. Autologous adult stem cells derived from bone marrow, referred to as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were injected into nonhuman primates via two routes, intravenously or directly into the lung of adult rhesus macaques. In addition, in one animal for each route, lung damage was induced prior to stem cell infusion by infection with Strep pneumo bacteria. Prior to and at various periods up to 6 months post-administration of stem cells the health and lung function of each transplant recipient will be evaluated using a battery of tests. Additionally, the levels and anatomical distribution of MSCs engrafted in the lung will be evaluated using both immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR assays. The project is at the point of data collection and analysis, with hopefully a manuscript assembled in the coming year. These investigations offer a novel potential therapeutic approach to repairing damaged lungs in cystic fibrosis and other lung diseases."," ",

The overall aim of this application is to use animal models to test the possibility that patients with diabetes can potentially be treated with the adult stem/progenitor cells from human bone marrow variously referred to as fibroblastoid colony forming units, mesenchymal stem cells, or multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs).  We and others previously demonstrated that MSCs have the remarkable property that they home to injured tissues and repair them.  Recently, we found that after human MSCs were infused into immunodeficient mice with Type I diabetes, induced by streptozotocin (STZ)-injection; the human cells homed to the pancreas, activated ¿-cells, and increased secretion of mouse insulin sufficiently to lower blood glucose.  The cells also homed to renal glomeruli and perhaps improved the pathological changes in the kidneys.  The results therefore raised the possibility that administration of a large number of a patient's own MSCs may provide an effective means of repairing the damage to pancreatic and other tissues that occurs in diabetes.  Our strategy is to examine the therapeutic potential of MSCs in a non-human primate model of Type I diabetes. The experiments will be central for our group to obtain data that can be used to develop an NIH grant application, as well as an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a human clinical trial for patients with Type I diabetes. The Specific Aim for this proposal is to determine whether autologous MSCs, expanded ex vivo and reinfused into non-human primates with spontaneous Type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) can improve ¿-cell function, lower blood glucose, improve glucose tolerance, and improve renal function.  These experiments will extend the results of the mouse model studies to an animal species closely approximating the human form of T1DM. These experiments will extend the results of the mouse model studies to an animal species more closely related to humans, and have been designed to accelerate the translation to human clinical trials. The animals have been assigned to the project. Two rounds of bone marrow biopsies have been performed and MSCs isolated for future transplantation."," ",

1.  Novel adult stem cell sources - We have reported on the discovery and characterization of multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells from new human tissue sources: (1) palatine tonsils, (2) dental pulp, (3) umbilical cord; and (4) traumatized muscle.  These cells exhibit multiple differentiation potential (osteo-, chondro-, and adipogenesis), express surface epitope characteristic of MSCs, and are immunosuppressive in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Efforts are underway to examine the molecular signature of these MSCs from different tissue sources to gain insight into how their cell fate and differentiation may be differentially regulated. 

2.  Wnt signaling mechanisms in MSCs - Both canonical (involving beta-catenin) and non-canonical Wnt signaling mechanisms operate in the MSCs in vitro, involving multiple Frizzled and LRP receptors.  The former appears to act to enhance self-renewal and proliferation and suppress differentiation, whereas the latter appears to act to enhance or stabilize lineage-specific differentiation induced by specific growth factors and culture conditions.  The involvement of Wnt signaling is likely to be critical in regulating the cell fate of MSCs.

3.  Differentiation and maturation of MSCs - We have initiated a study on the tenogenic differentiation of MSCs as a model to understand tendon development and repair.  In addition, we have characterized the regulation of chondrocytic hypertrophy in chondrifying pellet cultures of MSCs, for the purpose of developing means to regulate this undesirable premature development of MSCs in cell-based approaches to cartilage regeneration.

4.  ""Stemness"" genes and ""Reprogramming"" genes - In a previous study based on differential gene expression analyses, we have identified candidate genes that may function to maintain MSCs in an undifferentiated, self-renewal ready state.  A number of genes, including those encoding intracellular signaling and cytoskeletal proteins, extracellular matrix components, and cytokines are being analyzed for their cellular and molecular mechanisms of action.  In addition, the action of the 4 reprogramming genes, first reported by the Yamanaka group, is also being examined in terms of self-renewal and differentiation activities.  

Results from these studies should shed significant light on the basic mechanisms regulating stem cell activity as well as on potential approaches to direct their activities for applications in cell-based therapy.","1579264",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
Articular cartilage lines the surfaces of joints and functions to transmit the forces associated with joint loading. Limited by its poor healing capacity, there exists a growing demand for cell-based strategies for repair. Given the mechanical role of the native tissue, the successful replacement of articular cartilage using engineered constructs will require grown tissue possessing functional mechanical properties. In this study, we propose the combination of chondrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells (which can undergo chondrogenic differentiation) in a hydrogel environment (agarose and self-assembling peptide hydrogels), and focus on the development of compressive and tensile properties of these constructs. Tensile properties in mature cartilage are anisotropic, particularly in the superficial zone, and emerge during adolescence as maturation occurs with joint loading. Borrowing from this developmental concept, we suggest a novel bioreactor system designed to recapitulate the sliding contact that occurs between two contacting articular cartilage layers. Using this bioreactor, chondrocyte biosynthesis and chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs will be valuated as a function of pre-incubation period and duration and intermittency of sliding. It is hypothesized that the patterns of gene expression and differentiation will be dictated by the relation of the position in the gel to the applied contact, with enhancements occurring beneath and along the line of contact, particularly in the superficial layer. Subsequent long-term studies will utilize these optimized loading protocols to direct the increase the compressive and tensile (in the direction of sliding) mechanical properties of MSC- and chondrocyte-laden hydrogel constructs. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that these constructs will exhibit enhanced collagen content as well as a parallel collagen fiber orientation in the direction of sliding contact. This application examines the ability of chondrocyte- and MSC-laden hydrogels to achieve cartilage-like tensile properties, and to instill anisotropy in these constructs via culture in a novel sliding contact bioreactor system. These studies will provide insight into the mechanisms of cartilage differentiation and maturation. If realized, the specific aims of this proposal will further our efforts to produce clinically relevant chondrocyteand MSC-laden functional cartilage replacements that exhibit the complex material properties and anisotropies that define the native tissue and are necessary for its mature function.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
Human embryonic stem (hES) cells may provide an unlimited source of cells for therapeutic applications in degenerative diseases and cancer. One challenge is to harness the huge differentiation potential of hES cells towards selective derivation of different cell types of interest. We isolated mesenchymal precursors from differentiating hES cells cocultured with mouse OP9 stromal cells, by FACS sorting for the human mesenchymal marker CD73. By applying standard mesenchymal stem cell differentiation protocols, we succeeded in obtaining osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and skeletal myocytes from these precursors. Nevertheless, to ensure that these cells are suitable for future therapeutic applications, we developed a stroma-free differentiation method and demonstrated that hES cells could again be differentiated into CD73+ mesenchymal progenitors. In addition, we set up more specific culture conditions for the efficient generation of mature skeletal myocytes from the CD73+ precursors. Based on our preliminary results, showing that purified hES-derived skeletal myocytes can fuse to form myotubes, this proposal aims to study the function of hES-derived skeletal myocytes in vivo by transplantation into immunodeficient mice and in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy. The advantages associated with hES-derived skeletal muscle cells are their high proliferative capacity, expression of skeletal muscle commitment/stem cell markers Pax3 and Pax7, and the potentially enhanced migratory ability. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to characterize the in vitro differentiation of hES cells into skeletal myocytes, by optimizing the culture conditions for the selective differentiation of CD73+ precursors into skeletal myocytes, and by identifying putative soluble factor(s) produced by CD73- cells that lead to the enhancement of skeletal muscle differentiation, and 2) to assess the functional capacity of hES-derived skeletal myoblast progeny in vivo after artificial injury in a mouse model. First, we will explore muscle regeneration after cardiotoxin-induced lesions in immunodeficient mice (SCID Beige), and then translate the results into a mouse model of muscular dystrophy (mdx mice). Of note, isolation of factor(s) essential for muscle differentiation from this system could help to obtain better transplantable myocytes from hES, as well as adult stem cells, with consequently important clinical relevance.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  FGF signaling in the epithelium and mesenchyme plays important functions during lung development. A member of the FGF family, FGF10 is a master player in the signaling network mediating epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the lung. However, the specific mechanisms of action of FGF10 on the epithelium as well as the epithelial targets downstream of FGF10 in vivo are just emerging. In addition, how FGF10 impacts the formation of the smooth muscle cells, which are essential for alveolarization and lung function, is so far unknown. Our preliminary data indicate that we can use an Fgf10 hypomorphic mouse to decipher the role of FGF10 in lung development. Our preliminary results indicate that a) FGF10 signaling controls (-catenin signaling in the epithelium. b) FGF10 controls the amplification of the epithelial progenitors as well as maintains them in a ""distal-like"" phenotype and c) FGF10 signaling to the epithelium controls the formation of the alveolar smooth muscle cell progenitors. Furthermore, we recently reported that the pathological activation of an FGF10/FGFR2b autocrine feedback loop in the mesenchyme is responsible for the lung defects observed in a mouse model of Apert syndrome (De Langhe et al., 2006). Apert patients also exhibit many lung defects including fusion of tracheal cartilage, pulmonary aplasia, absent accessory lobe and defective interlobular septation. Our results also show that modulation of Fgf10 expression in this mouse model of Apert syndrome rescues the observed lung defects. This mouse Apert model will therefore allow us to determine how FGF signaling in the mesenchyme controls the differentiation and prevents the differentiation of the smooth muscle cell progenitors. Hypothesis: FGF10 is critical to control mesenchymal differentiation during normal and pathological lung development. Aim 1: To determine the role of epithelial FGF10 signaling during lung development using a newly described Fgf10 hypomorphic mouse. Aim 2: To determine the role of mesenchymal FGF signaling during lung development using a mouse model of Apert syndrome where Fgfr2b is ectopically expressed in the mesenchyme. Health Relevance: FGF10 is a key factor during lung development. Understanding the impact of FGF10 signaling on the proliferation and differentiation of the epithelium and mesenchyme throughout lung development in physiological and pathological situations may suggest novel strategies to rescue the lung dysplasia phenotype in patients with Apert syndrome as well as to rescue lung development in diseases of prematurity such as broncho-pulmonary dysplasia or emphysema and lung fibrosis in older patients.FGF signaling in the epithelium and mesenchyme plays important function during lung development.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have extensively investigated since the inception of this grant in 1972 the initial formation of valvulogenic mesenchymal progenitor cells called cushion tissue. However, once formed, very little is known about cushions become valves. Hypotheses are lacking both as to the morphogenetic processes of cushion remodeling and the potential mechanisms regulating them. Yet, valvular defects are among the most common and serious of all congenital heart defects whose implications may extend into adult life, predisposing the valve to diseases or disorders that compromise their hemodynamic functions (e.g. stenosis, prolapse or calcification). The central questions to be addressed are (i) why cushion mesenchyme normally differentiates into the fibrous connective tissues of mature valve leaflets when it has the potential to form other mesodermal phenotypes, (ii) if cushion differentiation is linked functionally to changes in biomechanical properties (iii) if cushion cells inductively interact with their adjacent myocardium to promote morphogenetic remodeling processes required for leaflet delamination and formation of valve supportive structures. A focus will be on a candidate gene periostin-based on progress made during the current funding period that indicates periostin can have both signaling and scaffold roles in cushion morphogenesis. The Specific Aims are based on the valve phenotype of mice deficient in periostin: AIM 1: To test the hypotheses that post-EMT cushion mesenchymal cells promote their own differentiation into valvular interstitial fibroblasts by secreting periostin. We will also test this ""pro-fibrogenic"" hypothesis by asking if abnormal patterns of differentiation (e.g. chondrogenic, cardiomyogenic) are initiated if AIM 2: To determine if the organization of the extracellular matrix is regulated by periostin as reflected by changes in the biomechanical and functional properties of the cushions during development. A Key question to pursued will be whether any functional changes in the viscoelastic properties of developing cushions/valves can be mechanistically linked to periostin effects upon compaction of the ECM to form mature valve cusps. AIM 3: To test the hypothesis that periostin (secreted by cushion cells) and bigH3 (secreted by myocardial cells) induce changes in myocardial celhcell adhesion that promote separation of cushion tissue from the myocardium triggering a cascade of morphogenetic remodeling events that initiate delamination, loss of myocardial junctional continuity and formation of the tension supportive apparatus.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significant advances in the treatment of myeloma have resulted in a high rate of complete remissions; however, all patients eventually relapse and succumb to the disease.  The bone marrow microenvironment, particularly the cells involved in bone formation and destruction, are intimately involved in the disease process as regulators of myeloma growth and tumor manifestations.  The overall goal of our research is to develop a new paradigm of myeloma therapy, whereby control of bone disease helps to control myeloma development and progression.  Working toward this goal, we propose experiments to elucidate the role of osteoblasts, the bone-forming marrow cells, in the disease process and to develop approaches to control myeloma by controlling the associated lytic bone disease.  Our experiments will address two specific aims to investigate in vitro and in vivo the consequences of interactions between myeloma cells and osteoblasts, at both the physiological and molecular levels.  We will examine in vivo in the SCID-hu model whether increasing the number and activity of osteoblasts results in bone formation and impacts myeloma growth (Specific Aim 1).  These experiments address our hypothesis that increasing osteoblast numbers and activity will increase bone formation and will control growth and survival of myeloma cells.  We will attempt to increase osteoblast number and activity by injecting osteoblast progenitor cells and parathyroid hormone, individually and in combination.  We will also elucidate in vitro the nature and consequences of interactions between myeloma cells and bone marrow-derived MSC on osteoblast differentiation and survival and on myeloma cell survival (Specific Aim 2).  These experiments are designed to pursue our hypothesis that, in patients with lytic bone disease, myeloma cells disrupt the mesenchymal stem cell to osteoblast differentiation process, and the resultant elimination of osteoblasts facilitates myeloma cell survival and disease progression.  Preliminary results suggest that the effects of intercellular interactions will be heterogeneous, and we propose experiments to examine potential sources for this variety.  We will employ state-of-the-art proteomics technologies to further investigate these interactions at the molecular level.  Our newly developed in vivo and in vitro models of myeloma cell/osteoblast interactions and myeloma disease progression, combined with advanced proteomics technologies, are powerful tools for deciphering critical aspects of myeloma biology, identifying targets for effective therapeutic interventions, and developing molecular tools for evaluating treatment efficacy.  The results of the proposed study will lead us to the next stage in which we will design treatment protocols aimed at improving myeloma-related bone disease and test treatment efficacy in preventing myeloma relapses and disease progression.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have tremendous potential as a non-immunogenic or autologous cell source for tissue regeneration. However, how the differentiation and function of MSCs are regulated by mechanical and chemical factors, especially in three-dimensional (3D) matrix, is not well understood. The long-term goal of this project is to use adult stem cells to construct tissues (e.g., vascular grafts) for cardiovascular repair. In this project, we propose to use tissue-engineered vascular grafts as a model to investigate the differentiation and function of MSCs in response to vascular mechanical and chemical stimuli in 3D matrix. When using stem cells to construct tissue-engineered vascular grafts, cell differentiation and matrix remodeling are two major issues. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that cyclic mechanical strain promotes MSC differentiation into vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and enhance matrix production in 3D vascular graft constructs, which is synergized by transforming growth factor beta (TGF- beta). The objectives of this project are: (1) To investigate the differentiation of MSCs into SMCs in response to mechanical strain and/or TGF-beta in 3D matrix; (2) To investigate the matrix remodeling by MSCs in response to mechanical strain and/or TGF-beta in 3D matrix. To investigate the mechanical and chemical regulation of MSC differentiation, we will culture MSCs in vascular graft constructs made of a collagen-fibrin gel matrix. To examine the effects of TGF- beta, we will include TGF-beta in some grafts. We will use a bioreactor to generate cyclic strain to mimic the mechanical environment of a blood vessel. DMA microarrays will be used to profile the genetic re-programming of MSCs. To determine matrix remodelling in our vascular grafts, the production of matrix proteins and the activity of metalloproteinases will be quantified. The mechanical properties of the vascular grafts will be measured using an Instron Test Machine. This research will break new grounds on stem cell engineering and tissue engineering, and advance our understanding on the roles of mechanical and chemical factors in the differentiation and function of MSCs. The results will provide a rational basis and novel approach for vascular tissue engineering that will eventually benefit our society. For example, this research will make it possible to use patients' bone marrow to construct autologous and non-immunogenic blood vessels. This research will also contribute to the knowledge of mechanobiology of stem cells in 3D matrix, which is critical but not well understood.

Following tissue injury, cells are mobilized from the bone marrow to the site of injury. As the inflammatory response subsides, the wound is remodeled to form stratified epithelia over a collagen-rich matrix containing mesenchymal cell types. Although the bone marrow contribution to the inflammatory response is well established, the long-term fate and role of bone marrow-derived cells in a healed cutaneous wound remains less clear. The bone marrow harbors stem cells capable of differentiating along hematopoietic cell and mesenchymal cell lineages. Both stem cell types have a high-degree of plasticity and are capable of contributing cells to multiple tissues, including skin. To better understand the role that bone marrow cells play in wound repair, we developed a chimeric mouse wound model in which mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from EGFP transgenic mice are transplanted into marrow-ablated C57BL mice. In this grant, we explore the hypothesis that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are a critical source of CD45- cells that regulate TGFbeta and collagen production in the skin and wound. We will test our hypothesis with the following specific aims: 
1. To determine the cellular phenotype and differentiation capability of bone marrow-derived MSC in normal and wounded murine skin. 
2. To determine the effect of MSCs on the production of TGF-Beta isoforms, collagen type I, and collagen type by keratinocytes and fibroblasts. 
3. To determine whether bone marrow-derived MSC can reverse diabetes impaired wound healing. 
4. To determine whether bone marrow-derived MSC are critical for wound healing.","273114",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this research is to use tissue engineering techniques to understand a craniofacial abnormality, Apert Syndrome. Apert Syndrome, a well studied genetic disease, is characterized as a premature closure of cranial sutures. The first step in engineering a therapy is to understand the cell function and tissue development, which is what this study proposes to do. Most studies only focus on cell function in two dimensions, but this project proposes to examine it in three dimensions, which better mimics the in vivo environment. Our strategy involves a cell-laden hydrogel that can be subcutaneously injected into an animal and polymerized (solidified) using light in a minimally invasive manner. Encapsulation of these mutant cells compared to normal mesenchymal stem cells will provide an understanding of bone and cartilage formation involved in the disease. The polymer used to fabricate the hydrogel scaffold is poly ethylene oxide diacrylate and other modified versions of this polymer, which provide improved properties. The mutant and normal mesenchymal stem cells will be evaluated in 2D monolayers, in vitro hydrogels, and in vivo hydrogels.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
Arthritis is a widespread debilitating disease in which the joint cartilage becomes disintegrated. Regenerating cartilage in vitro may be part of a plausible treatment for these conditions. The understanding how cartilage is degraded and how to produce new cartilage through bioengineering requires a thorough understanding of the signaling events that take place during cartilage formation. Our long-range goal is to unveil the mechanisms that govern cartilage formation in the embryo, which will provide the knowledge for treating arthritis and other skeletal diseases. The objective of this proposal is to investigate the regulation of Nkx3.2 expression and nuclear localization during chondrogenesis. Our central hypothesis is that the control of Nkx3.2 is a key mechanism to cartilage differentiation. We will test our hypothesis by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1. Investigate the mechanisms of Nkx3.2 nuclear localization controlled by pro-chondrogenic signals Shh, BMP and Sox9. 2. Examine the effect of cartilage-inhibiting signals TNF-a and IL-1 (i on Nkx3.2 expression and nuclear localization. 3. Determine if Nkx3.2 promotes cartilage differentiation in human mesenchymal stem cells. Nkx3.2 is an important protein because it not only promotes cartilage formation, but also prevents chondrocyte hypertrophy. Thus, Nkx3.2 is a plausible candidate to be introduced into the progenitor cells in order to promote the formation of permanent cartilage.

This proposal aims to assess in a relevant animal model the safety, feasibility and efficacy of adult stem cell administration to the CNS for treating neurological sequelae associated with lysosomal storage diseases.  Specifically, adult stem cells derived from bone marrow, referred to as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been injected unilaterally into the caudate putamen of infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) using stereotaxic coordinates determined by MRI.  Prior to and at various periods up to 1 year post-transplantation, the health, development, behavior as well as cogntive and motor skills of each transplant recipient will be evaluated using a battery of age appropriate tests and compared to sham-operated animals or normative control data.  Additionally, the levels and anatomical distribution of male MSCs engrafted in the CNS of female transplant recipients were evaluated using a real-time PCR assay we developed that targets sequences in the Macaca sp. Y chromsome.  To confirm the real-time PCR data engrafted MSCs were visualized in brain sections by immunofluorescent staining or FISH and counted using modern stereological techniques.  Correlating MSC engraftment in brain with long-term affects on health, development, behavior and motor function will directly assess the safety and feasibility of intracranial MSC administration.  

Collectively, these proposed studies will yield important pre-clinical safety and toxicology data in a relevant animal model that will be essential for developing stem cell-based therapies to treat neurological sequelae in human infants and children afflicted with various lysosomal storage diseases.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Several recent studies highlight the possibility of using multipotent adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for tissue engineering applications, and certain soluble factors (such as EGF) have been identified and characterized for their ability to promote MSC viability and differentiation into specific tissue types; however, much less is known about the role of the scaffold, designed to mimic the native ECM, in regulating the behavior of these stem cells. It is becoming increasingly clear that the ECM contains several factors, such as mechanical integrity, adhesion specificity, and growth factor availability, which are all individually and collectively critical in dictating the local cell and tissue behavior. The hypothesis of this proposal is that by independently tuning the stiffness, ligand identity and EGF-availability of the ECM, MSC behavior and signaling can be tightly regulated. Similar changes in the physical state of the microenvironment on 2-D surfaces have been previously shown to alter MSC phenotype. However, the signaling mechanism involved in these phenotypic changes remains unclear, as does how these cells will react to these factors in a 3-D environment. In addition, previous studies by the sponsors' laboratories have elucidated the importance of the EGF receptor in the enhancement of MSC viability on 2-D surfaces. This proposal aims to test this hypothesis in a novel 3-D environment that contains the versatility to independently control all of these parameters. To do this, this proposal includes the design of 3-D hydrogel constructs based on polyethylene glycol with tunable mechanical properties, the ability to tailor the specific ECM protein of interest to facilitate cell adhesion, and simple methods to control the availability of EGF. MSCs will be seeded throughout the bulk of these synthetic matrices and cultured for defined periods of time relevant for cellular responses specific to MSC behavior. During these studies, MSC apoptosis, proliferation, and lineage specification will be examined as a function of ECM crosslinking and ligand identity, as well as how this switch is affected by modulating EGFR-mediated signaling. The biophysical design criteria resulting from these studies will potentially have a far-reaching impact on the field of tissue engineering and in the future design of smart biomaterials to direct cell behavior.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Gastrulation employs morphogenetic movements to organize the basic body plan of all metazoans. This proposal is for studies on one of those remarkable morphogenetic changes, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which occurs in all organisms that have mesoderm. The project will explore regulatory mechanisms that (1) trigger the EMT through a ""pre-EMT gene regulatory network"" (pre-EMT CRN), (2) carry out the regulatory instructions of that GRN using endocytosis and exocytosis as important mechanisms in the transformation from the epithelial to a mesenchymal phenotype, and (3) assemble a new ""post-EMT gene regulatory network"" (post-EMT-GRN) necessary for mesenchymal cells to execute their new functions. Because these mechanisms involve cell transitions, many disease states co-opt, at least partially, the pathways under scrutiny, making this investigation more broadly significant. The three Specific Aims are: Specific Aim I: To discover how an EMT is regulated. Micromeres, the mesenchyme precursors in the sea urchin embryo, become specified under the control of the micromere gene regulatory network. That GRN changes to become the pre-EMT GRN just proximal to EMT and controls the morphogenetic change. Central to this Specific Aim is the observation that regulated expression of Snail and Twist not only control cadherin transcriptional downregulation, but also regulate endocytosis of the epithelial membrane, and simultaneously regulate exocytosis of the mesenchymal membrane components at EMT. Specific Aim II: To discover how epithelial cells shift phenotypically to a mesenchyme cell. At EMT, the plasma membrane is completely remodeled by endocytosis-exocytosis. This Aim will establish how endocytosis and exocytosis of the plasma membrane is regulated at EMT. Central to this Aim is the observation that at EMT bulk membrane replacement occurs by endocytosis of epithelial components while at the same time mesenchymal membrane components are inserted by regulated exocytosis. Specific Aim III: To assemble the post-EMT gene regulatory network. Once the mesenchyme cell arrives in the blastocoel, it no longer uses the pre-EMT GRN. This Aim is to discover how that network undergoes change at EMT. Central to this Aim is the observation that new receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signal transduction mechanisms are inserted into the nascent mesenchyme cells. Our hypothesis is that this signal transduction event is essential for the switch from the pre-EMT GRN to the post-EMT GRN. The discoveries made in these three Specific Aims will advance our understanding of an epithelial- mesenchymal transition which is conserved throughout the animal kingdom, and is at least partially co-opted :or invasive activities of metastasizing tumors.

Cell-cell adhesion determines the polarity of cells and participates in the maintenance of the cell societies called tissues.  Cell-cell adhesiveness is generally reduced thus allowing cellular migration following an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that occurs in normal developmental processes as well as in human cancers. As a consequence, epithelial cancer cells often lose the morphological hallmarks of typical epithelia as they become invasive and metastatic.  Similar modifications of cell-cell interactions are observed duing tumor progression of most carcinomas and has been related to the induction of EMT. We have recently identified a novel pathway where Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-Beta signals via Smads to activate Lymphoid Enhancing Factor (LEF)-1 to repress E-cadherin expression, thus allowing EMT during mouse embryogenesis. Interestingly, TGF-Beta and Smads have already been implicated during Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC); however, the mechanisms of activation of downstream signaling and the repression of E-cadherin in response to TGF-beta signaling is largely unknown.  Our hypothesis is that TGF-beta signaling represses E-cadherin activity via LEF1 transcription factor resulting in loss of adhesion and thus promoting EMT and invasion in HNSCC.  Our laboratory is positioned to make significant contributions to our understanding of E-cadherin function and the role this cellular structure plays in the development of HNSCC. The specific aims are; (1) to determine if TGF-beta represses E-cadherin expression and thereby influences cell adhesion, proliferation and motility in HNSCC. (2) To further study the mechanism of repression of the E-cadherin promoter in response to TGF-beta signaling and activation of the Smad and LEF1 transcription factors during tumorigenesis, and (3) to determine if TGF-beta signaling promotes acquisition of mesenchymal markers such as fibronectin and vimentin in HNSCC.  We will use structure/function studies to investigate the mechanism of TGF-beta signaling, the activation of the Smads and LEF1, and investigate the role of this unique pathway in repressing E-cadherin gene activity.  Collectively, the studies proposed herein will define the contribution of a novel signaling patway of TGF-beta and its affect on E-cadherin components for cellular motility, invasiveness in HNSCC."," ",

Chromosomal or genetic abnormalities have significant prognostic and therapeutic implications. However, it remains unclear which karyotypic changes represent disease-specific lesions or whether they evolved as a consequence of the aging process. It is likely that patients with a ""normal"" karyotype by traditional cytogenetics harbor smaller Iesions detectable if more precise methods were used. In general, the mechanisms leading to acquisition of chromosomal damage may include weakening of the DNA repair machinery and chromosomal instability. In addition, loss of telomeric sequences may render the chromosomes sensitive to rearrangement and loss although shortening of telomeres may also be a reflection of impaired DNA repair. We have developed technologies to study the relation of chromosomal changes and DNA repair defects in patients with MDS and age-matched elderly individual including targeted expression arrays and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (A-CGH). We hypothesize that ""cryptic"" chromosomal lesions can be detected by A-CGH in a proportion of MDS patients who have normal metaphase cytogenetics. The presence of increased numbers of these changes may reflect an acquired predisposition to genomic damage due to defects in gene repair, mitotic machinery and/or excessive telomere shortening. Such changes may be present in freshly isolated hematopoietic progenitor cells or be detectable upon induction through clastogenic stress in culture. We will determine whether karyotypic abnormalities are present in MDS patients with normal metaphase cytogenetics and whether these changes can also be encountered during the normal aging process. Subsequently, using a quantitative PCR assay, we will investigate whether telomere shortening in hematopoietic progenitor cells correlates with the presence of chromosomal defects.  Telomere length and frequency of chromosomal damage between hematopoietic and mesenchymal progenitor cells in patients with MDS and elderly individuals will be compared to determine whether the observed changes are restricted to the hematopoietic compartment. Finally, patterns of repair and chromosomal instability (CIN)-associated gene expression will be compared in patients and controls with and without chromosomal lesions in freshly isolated cells progenitor cells and upon induction following culture in the presence of clastogenic agents.","366235",

The defining event for EMT is disruption of E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, which results in loss of epithelial morphology and acquisition of a motile, mesenchymal phenotype.  The cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin is bound to beta-catenin and p120 catenin (p120ctn).  Although the contribution of free beta-catenin to tumor progression has been studied extensively, the functions of p120ctn have not been elucidated in detail in this regard.  This proposal is based on the hypothesis that p120ctn functions independently of E-cadherin in the cytoplasm and nucleus as a consequence of EMT and that these functions are linked to the behavior of invasive carcinoma cells.  Four specific aims are proposed to address this hypothesis.  Aim 1 will determine the expression and sub-cellular localization of p120ctn during the EMT using confocal laser microscopy and 3-D reconstruction.  In addition, the prognostic significance of p120ctn expression and localization will be assessed by automated analysis of tissue microarrays of colon and breast cancers.  Aim 2 will use RNAi to establish the contribution of p120ctn to the migration dynamics of invasive carcinoma cells and progression in vivo using established orthotopic models.  In Aim 3, the hypothesis that p120ctn influences the activation of specific Rho GTPases that are necessary for the EMT and migration of invasive carcinoma cells will be evaluated.  The emphasis of these studies will be on the Rho A and Rho C isoforms.  The final aim will address the role of p120ctn in the important problem of cadherin switching in carcinoma.  Loss of E-cadherin during EMT is correlated with up-regulation of N-cadherin, which has been implicated in migration and invasion, p120ctn associates with the transcriptional repressor Kaiso during the EMT and Kaiso consensus-binding sites exist in the N-cadherin promoter.  Thus, the hypothesis will be examined that during the EMT a population of p120ctn translocates into the nucleus where it interacts with Kaiso and inhibits its ability to repress the expression of N-cadherin.  In addition to its postulated role in cadherin switching, p120ctn binds to the JMD of N-cadherin but the potential importance of this interaction for the tumor promoting functions of N-cadherin has not been studied.  Aim 4 will undertake a rigorous analysis of N-cadherin regulation by p120ctn.","284277",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A fundamental aspect of age-related bone loss is the decreased proliferative capacity and impaired differentiation of osteoblasts in the bone of older individuals. Telomeres shorten with age in most human tissues, including bone, and since telomere shortening is a cause of cellular replicative senescence in cultured cells, including osteoblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), it is likely that telomere status in MSCs is a critical component of bone formation. Osteoporosis is common in the Werner (Wrn) and Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) premature aging syndromes. One of the targets of the Wrn helicase is telomeric DNA, but the long telomeres and abundant telomerase in mice minimize the need for WRN at telomeres, and thus Wrn knockout mice are healthy. In a model of accelerated aging that combines the Wrn mutation with the shortened telomeres of telomerase (Terc) knockout mice, synthetic defects in proliferative tissues, including bone, have been observed. It is hypothesized that deficiencies in genome maintenance molecules such as TERC and WRN cause a low bone mass phenotype and microarchitectural abnormalities of bone by impairing the ability of MSCs to differentiate into osteoblasts. It is further hypothesized that effective osteoblast differentiation depends on the presence of functional MSCs and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Using micro-CT analysis and bone histomorphometry, this proposal will establish the relationship between the WRN and TERC molecules and structural bone fidelity, including microarchitecture and bone density. We will determine if age-related bone abnormalities in Wrn-/-, Terc-/- and Wrn -/- Terc-/- mice are related to deficiencies in osteoblast differentiation and/or increased osteoclastogenic potential, and will examine whether anabolic defects due to MSC impairment in mutant mice are associated with replicative senescence and/or telomere shortening/uncapping. We will also assess the contributions of MSCs and HSCs to osteoblast differentiation by selective and nonselective bone marrow transplantation of these cellular progenitors and analysis of their ability to reduce age-related osteoporotic changes. A consequence and major clinical challenge in the elderly is osteoporosis and associated high risk of fracture. The Wrn-/-Terc -/- mutant mouse recapitulates senile osteoporosis characterized by decreased bone-forming capacity and provides a system to test stem cell replacement for amelioration of age-related osteoporosis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abrogation of cellular responses to Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) and other members of TGF-( superfamily are associated with human bone diseases such as osteoporosis, pulmonary hypertension and heritable cancer. Our long-term objective is to understand the molecular basis of how BMP/TGF-( regulate cell growth and differentiation, and the underlying mechanisms through which alterations in BMP signaling leads to deregulation of growth and differentiation control in human bone diseases. BMPs induce the differentiation of mesenchymal cells towards the osteoblastic lineage to promote bone formation. One of the most critical events in activation of BMP signal transduction pathway is the phosphorylation of transcription factor Smad1/5/8 (collective term for Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8) by BMP receptors. While phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 directly activate the target genes in the nucleus, protein phosphatases are anticipated to dephosphorylate phospho-Smad1/5/8 and consequently inactivate BMP signaling. The identity of the long sought-after phosphatase has been one of the major unanswered questions in BMP/TGF-( biology until very recently. We have discovered that Smad1/5/8 can be dephosphorylated by several phosphatases. Our short-term strategy for this proposal is to characterize biochemical properties of the phosphatases and investigate their biological functions in the regulation of BMP signaling during osteoblast differentiation. Our preliminary studies (both published and unpublished) lead us to hypothesize that Smad phosphatases block or terminate BMP signaling during osteoblast differentiation. Thus, it is significantly important to investigate the physiological roles of Smad phosphatases in bone formation. In this application, we will focus our study on the functions and molecular mechanism of Smad dephosphorylation during osteoblast differentiation. Three specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: Biochemical characterization of Smad phosphatases for dephosphorylation of BMP-specific Smad1/5/8. Aim 2: Elucidation of the functions of Smad phosphatases-mediated Smad dephosphorylation in BMP signaling. Aim 3: Investigation on the roles of Smad phosphatases in osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal stem cells.   
    The proposed experiments will open a new area of research on how Smad phosphatases modulate BMP signaling pathways through Smad dephosphorylation. Specifically, the elucidation of the physiological roles of Smad phosphatases-mediated dephosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, and perhaps other R-Smads as well, will provide insights into the important role of BMP/TGF-( signaling in bone growth and development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of this research proposal is to investigate the functions of protein phosphatases in bone formation. We have identified three phosphatases as negative regulators of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP). Our results will be pertinent towards the development of novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of human bone diseases.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K08 application from Jae-Woo Lee, MD, an anesthesiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who is establishing himself as an investigator in the use of cell-based therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) for treatment of acute lung injury. This application will provide Dr. Lee with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) develop two innovative and synergistic human acute lung injury models; (2) obtain expertise with molecular biology methods to study the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect of MSC; and (3) develop cell-based therapy with MSC transfected with plasmids overexpressing key soluble factors. To achieve these goals, Dr. Lee has assembled a Scientific Advisory Committee chaired by Dr. Michael A. Matthay, a renowned intensivist and expert in acute lung injury within the Cardiovascular Research Institute at UCSF. By the end of the grant, Dr. Lee will become an independent investigator focused on translational critical care research in the area of acute lung injury.   
  
In this application, Dr. Lee will test the hypothesis that allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells will restore alveolar fluid clearance and maintain lung endothelial permeability by modulating the proinflammatory response and by up-regulating the release of protective growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines in two innovative models of human acute lung injury. MSC, due to its pluripotent nature and its ability to secrete multiple paracrine factors such as growth factors (KGF, HGF) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-1ra) can treat multiple abnormalities simultaneously. In Aim 1, he will determine the mechanistic effects of human MSC on alveolar epithelial fluid transport in an in vitro model of human alveolar epithelial type II cells grown in Transwell plates with an air-liquid interface that are injured by cytomix, a mixture of the most biologically active cytokines found in ALI pulmonary edema fluid (IL-1f3, TNFa and IFNv).   
  
In Aim 2, he will test the therapeutic effect of intrapulmonary instillation of human MSC on alveolar epithelial fluid clearance and lung endothelial permeability after the establishment of endotoxin injury in an ex vivo perfused human lung preparation. In Aim 3, he will determine if transfection of allogeneic human MSC with plasmids over-expressing key soluble factors will lead to further protection in terms of alveolar fluid clearance and lung endothelial and epithelial permeability to protein in both human lung injury models. The support from this K08 grant will provide Dr. Lee with the necessary skills to become a successful independent investigator.   
  
Public Health Relevance: Despite extensive research into the pathophysiology, mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome remains at 40%. Current treatment options remain primarily supportive with lung protective ventilation and fluid conservative strategy. Innovative therapies are needed.

strategies based on combined stem cell and gene therapy. Bone marrow-derived porcine mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) expanded in culture possess robust self-renewal and multilineage differentiation
potentials, and are capable of producing many growth factors and cytokines. Although promising as
regenerative medicine in aging and disease, MSCs await further analysis regarding the mechanisms
governing their growth, differentiation, survival, tissue homing, and aging characteristics. Growth factor
modulation of MSC multilineage potential, the influence of aging on the function of MSCs, and the use of
allogeneic MSCs will be characterized. Central to these efforts is the use of recombinant adenovirus
expressing genes involved in cytoprotection, angiogenesis, and MSC homing. The first part of the proposal
relies on extensive cell culture characterizations of MSCs, building the foundation for the second part of the

using allogeneic and aged MSCs. Aim 5 will determine whether MSCs engineered for enhanced survival

hibernating myocardium. Long term, the translation between the MSC-based therapy in the porcine
hibernating myocardium and regenerative medicine for humans with chronic coronary artery disease will
 lead to optimized MSC therapeutics that can be of clinical value in managing aging and curing disease.","384759",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoclast differentiation depends on support provided by stromal cells. Although indirect evidence suggests that these stromal cells may be of the osteoblast lineage, the identity of these cells and their relationship to matrix-synthesizing osteoblasts remains unknown. One of the key mechanisms by which stromal cells support osteoclast differentiation is expression of receptor activator of NF(B ligand (RANKL). Hormones that stimulate osteoclast formation, such as PTH, do so by stimulating RANKL expression in stromal cells. However, the mechanisms controlling RANKL expression in these cells are only partially understood. The goals of this application are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that control RANKL expression in stromal cells and determine the relationship, if any, of these cells to matrix-synthesizing osteoblasts. During the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated that PTH controls RANKL expression in stromal cells via a distant transcriptional enhancer that we have designated the RANKL distal control region (DCR). DCR knockout mice have reduced RANKL expression and increased bone mass and strength. The transcription factor Runx2 binds to the DCR, suggesting a linkage to osteoblast differentiation; however, stimulation of RANKL was not altered in cells from Runx2-deficient mice. Therefore, the molecular basis of DCR action and RANKL cell type-specific expression remains unclear. We also determined that ablation of matrix-synthesizing osteoblasts and their immediate precursors did not alter RANKL expression or osteoclast formation in bone, highlighting the contention that the identity of stromal cells remains unknown. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that matrix-synthesizing osteoblasts and the stromal cells that support osteoclastogenesis are derived from a common mesenchymal precursor, which bifurcates early in its specification into these two distinct lineages. Aim 1 will identify the molecular mechanisms by which the DCR functions by determining whether other members of the Runx family of transcription factors are required for RANKL expression in the absence of Runx2. In addition, other proteins that bind the DCR will be identified by footprinting and their role in DCR action determined by gain- and loss-of-function studies. Aim 2 will identify osteoclast support cells using two complementary approaches: (1) by localizing RANKL-expressing cells and their descendants in bone and (2) by determining whether RANKL expression in genetically defined cell populations is required for osteoclast formation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed studies seek to identify stromal cells that support production of bone-degrading cells. This will be accomplished by studying a gene expressed in stromal cells that is essential for production of bone-degrading cells. Increased understanding of the mechanisms that control bone resorption will provide essential information for the development of therapies to maintain or increase bone mass and strength, thereby reducing the risk of osteoporotic fractures.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     
The purpose of this proposal is to cultivate the scientific development and advance the research skills of Dr. William Lawson, so that he may become an independent investigator. Dr. Lawson is currently developing his academic career in the Center for Lung Research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC). VUMC provides an environment conducive to developing physician-scientists through its many laboratory resources, educational opportunities, and expert faculty. Under guidance by Dr. Timothy Blackwell, Dr. Lawson will design and perform experiments that will enhance his knowledge and research skills in the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis. Through laboratory experience and formal coursework, he will gain expertise in experimental design and execution, transgenic murine model development, cell and molecular biology techniques, statistical analysis, and reporting of results. These skills will provide the foundation for Dr. Lawson to pursue an independent academic career in pulmonary fibrosis research. In Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IFF), progressive parenchymal fibrosis disrupts the structure and gas exchanging functions of the lungs, with fibroblasts largely responsible for the augmented collagen and matrix deposition. The origin of lung fibroblasts during pulmonary fibrosis has not been well defined, but potential sources include proliferation of resident interstitial lung fibroblasts, differentiation of progenitor cells from the bone marrow, and transition of epithelial cells to a fibroblast phenotype, a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In preliminary data, we present evidence that EMT is a major contributor to the lung fibroblast population in experimentally induced pulmonary fibrosis. For this proposal, we have formed the following hypothesis: Epithelial cells and mesenchymal cells in the lung are capable of phenotypic transitions during pulmonary fibrosis. During lung fibrosis, fibroblasts can arise from airway epithelial cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and during resolution fibroblasts can resume an epithelial cell phenotype. Modulating factors that regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition will limit progression and promote resolution of lung fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we have developed the following specific aims: 1) to define the contribution of epithelial-mesenchymal transition to the lung fibroblast population in pulmonary fibrosis; 2) to characterize key pathways involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition in type II alveolar  
epithelial cells; and 3) to determine the effects of attenuating or reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition on the progression and resolution of lung fibrosis. IPF remains a disease with a dire prognosis greatly in need of effective treatment strategies. Defining the role of EMT in the lung and delineating critical pathways involved in this cellular plasticity could lead to novel therapeutic strategies to limit disease progression in IPF and other forms of lung fibrosis.

 the fracture site. An impairment of the fracture healing process is reported in 10% of the 6.2 million
 fractures occurring annually in the United States, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Limitation
 of stem cell number and imbalance between anabolic and catabolic hormones and growth factors are key
 elements in determining fracture repair failure. Formation of a cartilage template is essential during the
 fracture repair process. Adult bone marrow (BM) contains a reservoir of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
 with in vitro and in vivo potential of becoming cartilage. However, the molecular signals and growth factors
 that convert MSC from the process of self-replication to that of chondrogenic differentiation are unknown.
 Our long-term objective is to understand the molecular mechanisms that determine the regenerative
 potential of MSC to devise more effective therapies to ameliorate the fracture healing process. Our studies
 demonstrate that transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) and insulin-like growth factor-l (IGF-I)
 determine the chondrogenic potential of MSC by inducing chondroprogenitor condensation, growth and
 differentiation into chondrocytes. We have also demonstrated that MSC when systemically infused are
 specifically recruited to the fracture site where they differentiate into chondrocytes. We hypothesize that
 TGF-beta and IGF-I have anabolic chondroinductive effects in the cartilage formation process derived from
 MSC. We further hypothesize that the chondroinductive actions of TGF-beta and IGF-I can be used to
 engineer MSC to promote the fracture healing process. The two Specific Aims of this proposal are:1) to
 discover the mechanisms by which TGF-beta and IGF-I determine the MSC chondrogenic potential; 2) to
 determine the role of TGF-beta and IGF-I in the fracture repair capacity of MSC. To accomplish these
 specific aims, proposal will combine structural biology, biochemistry, mouse models and molecular imaging
 techniques for tracing MSC in vivo. We expect that the results of this multi-faceted experimental approach
 will provide greater understanding of the basic biology and regenerative capacity of MSC. Understanding
 the role of TGF-beta and IGF-I in the chondrogenic potential of MSC will provide critical information for the

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary hypertension (PHtn) is a life-threatening condition that can affect all ages, from neonates to adults. The hallmark of this disorder is increased pulmonary arteriolar vasoconstriction and vessel wall remodeling characterized by intimal hyperplasia, excess smooth muscle cell layers in the media, and deposition of extracellular matrix. Although the survival and quality of life has improved in patients with pulmonary hypertension, there is no cure for this disease. The mainstay of current medical treatment falls into several forms of therapy, including the use of vasodilators, anti-coagulants, anti-platelet agents, anti- inflammatory and vascular-remodeling therapies. Hypoxia is a known primary or secondary stimulus for the development of PHtn and various animal models exposed to hypoxia develop the pulmonary and cardiac manifestations that are characteristic of human disease. We have investigated the therapeutic potential of treating hypoxia-induced PHtn with genetically-engineered bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) expressing the cytoprotective gene, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Using a mouse model of hypoxia- induced pulmonary hypertension that we and others have characterized, we had previously reported that transgenic mice with lung-specific overexpression of HO-1 driven by the surfactant protein C (SPC) promoter (SHO1) do not develop PHtn in response to hypoxic exposure. Mice deficient in HO-1 have a maladaptive response to hypoxia and in addition to pulmonary hypertension, they develop right ventricular dilatation and infarction compared to wild type animals. We have generated preliminary data showing that transplantation of MSC over-expressing HO-1 via the jugular vein into the lung could reverse hypoxia-induced PHtn in mice deficient in HO-1. Our overall goal is to understand the mechanisms by which MSC inhibit /reverse the development of pulmonary hypertension in the hypoxic mouse model so that we can develop rational therapies for the treatment of this disease in humans. The specific aims of the proposal are: (1) to investigate whether HO-1 is required for the protective action of MSC on the development of pulmonary hypertension, (2) to investigate the mechanisms of MSC homing and engraftment in the lung, and (3) to investigate the basis of MSC repair mechanisms in the hypoxic lung.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Role of matrilysin-mediated E-cadherin shedding in wound healing. Tissue injury leads to proliferation, differentiation, and migration of epithelial cells. These processes involve the coordinated action of various proteins, including several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Previous data from our lab demonstrated that matrilysin (MMP-7) is required for repair of wounds to the lung. Matrilysin is expressed on basolateral surfaces of migrating airway epithelial cells, and it mediates E- cadherin shedding during the re-epithelialization process. In the absence of matrilysin, E-cadherin is not shed from wound edge cells in response to injury, and airway wounds do not close. We will test the hypothesis that matrilysin shedding of E-cadherin promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation and re-epithelialialization in mouse lungs. Aim1 is to identify the matrilysin cleavage site in mouse E-cadherin and to develop a proteolytic-resistant E-cadherin construct in an epithelial cell culture model. Aim 2 is to analyze the effect of E-cadherin shedding in vivo by developing a transgenic mouse line expressing a proteolytic-resistant E-cadherin on an E-cadherin-null background. The experiments proposed here will determine the function of matrilysin-mediated E-cadherin shedding in wound repair.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is an inherited mechanobullous disorder characterized by fragility of the skin and mucous membranes. The morphological hallmark of DEB includes splitting of the basement membrane zone of the dermal-epidermal junction, with a cleavage plane lying within the papillary dermis. The abnormal assembly of anchoring fibrils is caused by genetic mutations in the gene (COL7A1) encoding collagen type VII synthesized by the basal keratinocytes of the epithelium and the fibroblast of the papillary dermis. At present, there are no specific therapies for any form of inherited DEB. Day-to-day management of the disease is concentrated on the prevention of mechanical trauma, infections via judicious use of bandages or loose-fitting garments and topical antibiotics. Precise understanding of the genetic lesions underlying different subtypes of DEB, and elucidation of the consequences of such mutations at the protein level, enabled us to continue our attempts to develop therapy approaches towards counteracting the clinical manifestations in this devastating skin disease. Recent advances in stem cell research have raised the possibility that use of adult stem cells from bone marrow may provide dramatic new therapies for treatment of inherited and acquired diseases. Bone marrow contains mesenchymal progenitor cells, called mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), that have several unique properties suggesting the feasibility of their use as a therapeutic vehicle: (1) a relatively simple isolation; (2) the ability to be cultured in vitro in minimal conditions and to expand to quantities required for therapy; (3) the ability for ex vivo transduction; (4) plasticity, the potential to differentiate under exogenous stimuli; (5) the ability to engraft after reintroduction; (6) high metabolic activity and efficient machinery to express therapeutic proteins in secretory form; and, (7) the ability to be delivered systematically or locally. The proposed research is a logistical extension of our work in the field of non-viral gene therapy. The main objective of these studies is to test the hypothesis that engraftment of genetically normal MSC will lead to expansion of the transplanted cells in sufficient numbers in the skin of DEB mice and the level of collagen VII will be sufficient to reduce the pathologic phenotype. The following parameters are will be investigated: (1) the rout of MSC delivery, distribution and quantity of transplanted cells in DEB skin; (2) the kinetics of MSC distribution in DEB skin; (3) the phenotypic and functional features of engrafted MSC; (4) the kinetics of distribution and release of mature collagen VII in the intact mouse skin; (5) the ability of MSC to produce collagen VII to form anchoring fibril-like structures; (6) the deposition of collagen VII fibers into the BMZ; (7) the structure of the newly formed collagen VII fibers; and, (8) the ability of newly formed fibers to interact with BMZ's macromolecules. A successful outcome of these studies may form a platform for development of a novel therapeutic approach for curing connective tissue disorders, as well as other human genetic disorders. In the current project, we suggested to test the hypothesis that engraftment of genetically normal mesenchymal stem cells isolated from bone marrow will lead to expansion of transplanted cells in sufficient numbers in the affected skin of DEB mice and the level of collagen VII will be sufficient to reduce the pathologic phenotype. If successful, the suggested strategy may become powerful therapeutic approach for treatment of connective tissue disorders, in particular dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, and benefit public health.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Adipose tissue constitutes the major repository of energy stores for vertebrate organisms. In addition to its function as a site of storage and mobilization of triacylglycerols (the major lipid stored in adipose cells), it is now quite apparent that adipose cells secrete a large number of lipids and proteins, termed adipokines or adipocytokines, that can exert a wide variety of effects in an autocrine, paracrine or endocrine fashion. There is substantial evidence to support the presence of heterogeneity among adipose cells. Moreover, there are regional differences in the function of adipose depots. Adipocytes within the bone marrow might constitute a depot that is unique due to its relationship to bone. There is a strong inverse relationship between bone mass and bone marrow adipose tissue with aging and osteoporosis. The objective of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms how adipocytes, both within the bone marrow and in peripheral depots, affect bone growth and maintenance during aging. The specific aims are 1) to test the hypothesis that adipose cells found within the bone marrow constitute a distinct depot of adipose tissue whose characteristics differ from other adipose tissue depots such that marrow adipose cells are uniquely specialized to influence bone growth and maintenance, as well as hematopoiesis; 2) to test the hypothesis that the actions of hormone-sensitive lipase affect the micro-environment of the bone marrow and that removal of hormone-sensitive lipase function by gene deletion maintains high bone mass in aging mice; and 3) to identify and establish the relative importance of adipose-derived mediators responsible for influencing bone metabolism.

This application pertains to studies of tissue reconstituting potential of human cord blood and adult stem cells based on a mouse/human xenograft model developed in our laboratory. In this model, ""conditioned"" newborn NOD/SCID/Beta2-microglobulin-null mice supported high-level hematopoietic engraftment by human cord blood cells. Recent studies using this model indicated that cord blood stem cells are capable of generating human hepatocytes and may also have the abilities to generate exocrine pancreatic cells and cardiomyocytes. This grant proposal is to determine the tissue reconstituting potential of human cord blood stem cells using this neonatal mouse xenograft model. Attempts will also be made to identify and purify the stem cells that are present in the cord blood by determining the surface phenotypes of tissue-engrafting cells. The major techniques to be used are fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify human cells and immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization for mRNA to delineate the tissue/cell lineages of the engrafted human cells. Comparison of these results with a separate study in our laboratory of tissue reconstituting potential of adult mouse stem cells indicates that there may be significant developmental control of the stem cell potentials. Based on these observations the following Specific Aims are proposed. 
Specific Aim #1: To determine the tissue reconstituting potential of human cord blood stem cells in a neonatal mouse xenograft model. 
Specific Aim #2: To identify and purify the human tissue reconstituting cells using the neonatal mouse xenograft model. 
Specific Aim #3: To determine the developmental control of the tissue reconstituting potentials of the stem cells in neonatal and adult mouse xenografts.","268810",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive disorder that leads to degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons, muscle atrophy, and ultimately death. The onset of disease is usually between 40 and 60 years of age. In 5% of cases, ALS is caused by a point mutation in the super oxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1) and is referred to as familial ALS. Motor neuron cell death and paralysis result when this mutation is over expressed in mice and rats (SOD1G93A mutants). This translational research proposal will investigate the efficacy of ex vivo cell therapy targeting skeletal muscles to ameliorate motor neuron death in a rat model of ALS. We will focus on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) derived from bone marrow, which can be isolated from normal donors or patients with ALS, easily expanded to large numbers and modified ex vivo with transgenic genes using viral vectors. We propose to use the hMSC as ""Trojan horses"" to deliver key trophic factors postulated to have a role in ALS pathogenesis: glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We will also determine the potential benefits of this hMSC based approach compared to a viral vector based approach. Furthermore, we will determine if combined delivery of these growth factors using hMSC has any synergistic effects on motor neuron loss in the SOD1G93A rats. These aims will provide highly novel insights into effective approaches using cell and growth factor-based treatments for ALS, and may provide the rationale for novel therapeutic strategies for a neurodegenerative disease with no known cure. Our rationale for using human mesenchymal cells in this project is that they represent a safe viable source of cells that could potentially be used in multiple clinical trials. Thus, any results acquired from the use of these cells in animal models of disease will be directly translatable to pre-clinical studies in ALS. The relevance to the NIH mission of improving health becomes extremely high when using human cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable disease characterized by rapid loss of muscle control and eventual paralysis. The proposed research will contribute new novel information to effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, which is relevant to the NIH mission of improving public health.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac tissue injury during myocardial infarction often leads to congestive heart failure. The field of tissue engineering offers the promise of generating a muscle patch that would structurally and functionally repair tissue damage resulting from infarction or congenital heart defects. However, current cardiac tissue engineering techniques suffer from a number of limitations that preclude their use in clinical applications. In particular, safe and efficient repair of myocardial infarction requires that engineered cardiac tissue patch: 1) mimics the anisotropic (aligned) architecture of native cardiac muscle and 2) exhibits sufficient thickness (multiple muscle layers) in order to prevent dilation of the heart and improve its contractile function. Nevertheless, the method to engineer a 3D tissue patch with a cm2 area and uniform cell alignment throughout its volume is still non-existent, even for patches as thin as 50 ¿m. This proposal will test the hypothesis that cultivation of cardiac cells within microfabricated porous hydrogel networks will improve the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen to embedded cells while simultaneously enabling control over local cell alignment. The specific aims of this project are: 1) to develop methods to micropattern and stack thin porous cell/hydrogel networks into a relatively thick anisotropic cardiac tissue patch that will be cultured in a rotating bioreactor and 2) to assess the electrical and mechanical function of the resulting cardiac patch as a function of its thickness and micropatterned pore geometry. In the future, the methods developed in this study will be applied to clinically relevant cell types (e.g. embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, skeletal myoblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, resident cardiac progenitor cells), and the resultant tissue patches will be assessed in animal studies for their ability to repair cardiac tissue damage and prevent the onset of heart failure.

Musculoskeletal Disorders developed the Cell Core. The mission of the Cell Core is to
facilitate the experimental use of authentic, primary, mouse and rat osteoblastic cells as well
as osteoclasts generated from in vitro culture.
As part of our new initiatives bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are now
available to Core investigators. Although outside the original mandate of the Core, the
Director has made his PIXImus machine available to Center members through an agreement
with the Densitometry subunit of the Physiology Core.
The Specific Aims of the current proposal are to provide the following services:
1. Isolate and cultivate primary murine and fetal rat calvarial osteoblasts. This will include
large-scale preparations for biochemical studies and RNA and DNA purification.
2. Cultivate murine osteoclast-like cells generated from: 1) in vitro co-culture 2) culture with MCSF
and RANKL.
3. Maintain a wide range of frozen cell lines.
4. Provide small animal bone densitometry (DEXA).
5. Cultivate mouse bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
6. Train for in vitro isolation and culture of osteoblasts, osteoclasts and stromal cells, so that
investigators, appropriately trained, can initiate and maintain these cells in their laboratories.
These services are coordinated under the directorship of Dr. Mark Horowitz, who has had
extensive experience with cell culture in general and the isolation and culture of bone cells
specifically. The Cell Core is particularly anxious to support current and future Pilot and
Feasibility Projects as part of the Center's ongoing effort to attract new investigators to
musculoskeletal research.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endochondral ossification is a major process in skeletal development and repair, during which mesenchymal progenitors undergo growth and differentiation into mature chondrocytes prior to bone formation. Several signaling pathways contribute to precise regulation of the onset and progression of chondrocyte maturation during endochondral ossification through transcriptional regulation. The early molecular mechanisms that mediate and promote endochondral ossification during bone repair are still unknown, and for the most part, not well established. The Runt homology of transcription factors Runx 1, 2 and 3 are key regulators of organogenesis and skeletal formation. We have compelling preliminary data to support our central hypothesis that the hematopoietic-related transcription factor Runx1/AML1/Cbfa2 is necessary for mesenchymal stem cell commitment towards chondrogenesis and mediates the early stages of chondrocyte maturation. We will assess the expression and regulation of Runx1 in vivo and in vitro in  
comparison to the already established bone and cartilage-related factor Runx2/AML3/Cbfa1 (Specific Aim 1). We will then determine the function of Runx1 during chondrogenesis and chondrocyte maturation in vitro using gain and loss of function approaches (Specific Aim 2). Its requirement for bone repair will be determined through fracture healing experiments, and Its role in mediating endochondral ossification in vivo will also be assessed using trangenic mouse models (Specific Aim 3). Our preliminary data show for the first time that Runx1/AML1/Cbfa2 is a central regulator of endochondral ossification and cartilage formation at multiple levels. Furthermore, its function is not redundant but complementary to Runx2/AML3/Cbfa1 which mediates the late stages of chondrocyte hypertrophy and mineralization. Completion of our experimental aims will provide crucial information regarding skeletal formation and repair as well as novel molecular candidates for the treatment of bone and cartilage diseases.

cells. Many human carcinomas, including those of the breast, consist of neoplastic epithelial cells
intermingled with a complex mixture of cells, including fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, endothelial cells and
immune cells, which collectively form the tumor stroma. The supporting stroma of a carcinoma is distinct
from that found in the adjacent normal tissue, and as the carcinoma expands, these stromal cells are
recruited and induced to proliferate. The presence of stromal cell types within carcinomas is a powerful
determinant of the biology of a tumor through its ability to have profound influences on the growth, survival,
invasiveness, and metastatic powers of the neoplastic epithelial cells. The presence of these cells has been
demonstrated by our laboratory and others to have an essential role in supporting tumor progression;
however, the mechanisms of stromal recruitment and how these cells contribute to tumor growth are not well
understood.
The proposed studies are directed at elucidating the recruitment of stromal cells and the mechanisms by
which they influence tumor progression by accomplishing the following:
A1. Determining the origins of the tumor-associated stromal cells;
A2. Determining the nature of the signals used to recruit stromal precursor cells;
A3. Characterizing the heterotypic signals released by recruited stromal cells that
influence invasion and metastasis by carcinoma cells;

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-range goal of this research is to exploit the multilineage differentiation capacity of bone marrow stem cells in the development of novel cellular therapies. This application builds on the demonstration that clinical transplantation of whole bone marrow (BMT) results in donor cells engraftment in the bones of patients with osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic bone disorder. Subsequent transplantation of isolated gene-marked mesenchymal stem cells also led to donor cell engraftment in bone but at a much lower level that seen with BMT, suggesting that the major source of osteogenic activity in bone marrow is not represented in the plastic-adherent population of marrow stem cells. Thus, a murine BMT model was transplanted with retroviraly-transduced donor cells in an effort to identify the putative stem cell responsible for the unexpected effect of BMT on osteogenesis. In addition to blood, the plastic-nonadherent marrow cells gave rise to 20-50% of the osteoblasts identified in bone. Clonal analysis by retroviral integration site studies revealed that a single nonadherent marrow cell had given rise to both blood and bone cells, indicating the existence of a multipotent marrow with both hematopoietic and osteopoietic differentiation capacity. Aim 1 seeks to define the phenotype and developmental potential of this cell, using GFP-expressing transgenic mice as donors of candidate marrow cell subsets whose properties will be tested and compared in a murine transplantation model. The multilineage differentiation capacity of the strongest candidates will be verified by rigorous clonal analysis (comparison of retroviral integration sites) after single-cell transplantation. Related experiments will determine the requirement for accessory cells in the commitment of stem cells to differentiate in the osteocytic pathway. In Aim 2, the goal is to test our working hypothesis in a rhesus macaque monkey model, investigating the capacity of gene-marked CD34+ and CD34- (SP) nonadherent marrow cells to clonally regenerate the hematopoietic and osteopoietic compartments. Results of this aim will provide valuable estimates of the feasibility of marrow stem cell-based therapy for human bone diseases or injury. Finally, in Aim 3, efforts will be made to identify growth factors that might stimulate the differentiation of marrow stem cells toward the osteocytic lineage, thus addressing the general issue of low-level engraftment by tissue (adult) stem cells. Collectively, the data generated by this 5-year project will help to clarify several outstanding questions in stem cell biology and the therapeutic relevance of marrow stem cells with apparent multilineage potential.

 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this proposal is to determine if the success of in utero hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be improved with co-transplantation of facilitating cells (mesenchymal stem cells and alloreactive natural killer cells). We hypothesize that the use of these cells will improve the competitiveness of donor stem cells and ultimately increase the level of chimerism that is achieved after in utero hematopoietic transplantation. Theoretically, in utero transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells should treat and cure many heritable disorders of the lymphohematopoietic system. Target diseases potentially include hemoglobinopathies, immune deficiencies, and leukodystophies. Most of these disorders exert their deleterious effects prior to birth making the rationale for in utero treatment imperative. The feasibility of in utero therapy is supported by a variety of natural occurring human and animal chimeras that demonstrate high levels of stable mixed chimerism. However, successes in both experimental models and in the human fetus have not been as encouraging as the levels of chimerism achieved would not be expected to successfully treat human fetal disease. Two major exceptions are the fetal-sheep model and settings where there is a competitive advantage for donor cells as for example in W/W mice and in fetuses with severe immune defects (e.g. X-SCID). While the fetus may theoretically be an ideal candidate for therapy it is clear that significant barriers exist that prevent clinically relevant levels of chimerism from being achieved. Transplantation methods that will improve the competitiveness of donor cells must be developed if the potential of fetal transplantation is going to become a clinical reality. In this application we will determine if engraftment and chimerism can be improved with the use of hematopoietic facilitating cells. We also will evaluate the ability of these facilitating cells to reduce the risk of in utero graft verses host disease. If our hypotheses are correct, then in utero treatment for hematopoietic and immune disorders should be both safer and successful.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
  
Silicosis develops many years after initial exposure to silica particles and is characterized by chronic inflammation, lung fibrosis and ultimately respiratory impairment. There is no effective treatment for silicosis. As a result, patients diagnosed with silicosis are given a dismal prognosis and many patients are still dying of this disease. The biochemical mechanisms behind silicosis are poorly characterized, however oxidants do play a role in disease development. The antioxidant enzyme extracellular superoxide dismutase (ECSOD), the major antioxidant enzyme in the lung extracellular matrix (ECM), protects against other fibrotic lung diseases. Previous studies have correlated the loss of ECSOD with worsening lung injury and a pro-oxidant lung environment. ECSOD overexpression or treatment with SOD-mimetic drugs can prevent this injury. Thus, one component of an effective treatment strategy may be the restoration of the oxidant / antioxidant balance in the lung. Studies show that administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can participate in the repair of lung tissue after oxidative injury. However, little is known about the effects of a highly oxidative lung microenvironment on stem cell-mediated tissue repair. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that silicosis results in a pro-oxidant microenvironment that leads to the reduced efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells to repair lung damage. The investigators will employ a mouse silicosis model whereby MSCs purified from either ECSOD null mice or ECSOD overexpressing mice are administered to animals exposed to silica. The effects of modulating antioxidant levels of both the stem cells and the recipient mice will be determined on the efficacy of the stem cell treatment. When complete, these studies will provide valuable information on the influence of the lung microenvironment on the ability of stem cells to abrogate lung disease. These studies will also begin to address the feasibility of transplanting purified MSCs with augmented antioxidant capabilities into patients with silicotic lung disease as therapy. Lung disease due to silica exposure (silicosis) is a continuing public health problem that has no effective treatment. This project examines the use of adult stem cells along with increased levels of antioxidants in the treatment of silicosis. These studies will help determine the feasibility of using adult stem cells in the treatment of patients with silicosis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a two year career enhancement program of intensive training and hands-on experience in stem cell culture which will provide the basis for re-directing the Principal Investigator's ongoing research in transplantation to study the survival of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes after intracardiac injection into infarcted rat hearts. The proposed training program will provide an opportunity for the Principal Investigator to enter the field of stem cell biology under the direction of her mentors Dr. Gay Crooks and Dr. Robert Kloner. Dr. Crooks is a recognized leader in the field of stem cell research. She is Director of the Stem Cell Program and is a Professor of Pediatrics at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and the University of Southern California. She is renowned in the field of hematopoiesis, well-respected for her contributions to the field of stem cell research and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and students in her laboratory. The proposed training program is further enhanced by the co-mentorship of Dr. Robert Kloner, Director of the Heart Institute at Good Samaritan Hospital and a leader in the field of cardiomyocyte regeneration. An advisory committee of renowned scientists will provide scientific guidance, and were selected for their expertise that directly relates to the research proposed in this application. The research proposed will address whether over-expression of a cytoprotective gene in mesenchymal stem cells will enhance the survival and function of co-transplanted cardiomyocytes. Early gene expression changes associated with apoptosis, inflammation, cytoprotective gene expression and angiogenesis in human cardiomyocytes transplanted into infarcted rat hearts will be identified. The specific aims include: 1) To assess hESC-derived cardiomyocyte survival and function following transplantation of human cardiomyocytes with and without co-transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing HO-1 into infarcted rat hearts. The long-term survival of cardiomyocytes will be monitored by bioluminescent imaging and function will be monitored by hemodynamic measurements and LV angiograms and 2) To identify early gene expression changes in human cardiomyocytes transplanted into infarcted nude rat hearts. Laser capture microdissection and focused pathway arrays will be used to study gene expression changes in hESC derived cardiomyocytes. The proposed training in stem cell biology will form the foundation for the Pi's future plans to extend her research in transplantation tolerance to studying early immune response events after stem cell transplantation.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term programmatic goal is to utilize adult marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (mesenchymal stem cells - MSC) in tissue engineered constructs to repair craniofacial and long bone defects. MSC have robust potential to become osteoblasts and human MSC (hMSC) can form bone when implanted in heterotopic and orthotopic sites in animal models. A distinct advantage of exploiting the therapeutic potential of these stem cells is that autologous hMSC are easily cultivated from small marrow aspirates. Clinically, marrow could be collected from a patient, hMSC cultivated in vitro, and then delivered back to the patient. However, to most effectively use hMSC therapeutically, we must be able to fully control their differentiation. This requires a complete understanding of physiologically relevant factors that regulate hMSC differentiation, and in turn, downstream signaling and transcriptional networks that are activated. Our preliminary results show that bone morphogenetic-6 (BMP6) is an important autocrine mediator of hMSC differentiation. BMP6 is the only osteogenic BMP produced by hMSC and short-term treatment of cells with exogenous BMP6 promotes sustained expression of the osteogenic transcription factor osterix, leading to osteoblast differentiation. For this project we propose three specific aims: (1) we will examine the significance of endogenous BMP6 for osteoblast differentiation, (2) we will study BMP6 signaling that directs osteoblast differentiation, and (3) we will study the importance of BMP6-induced expression of osterix. These aims will be pursued in vitro, in vivo, and computationally by a team of investigators that includes a veterinary scientist and an orthopaedic surgeon - both trained as biochemists - and a computational biologist. Mechanistic experiments examining BMP6 function and cell signaling will be pursued in vitro and will utilize primary hMSC and human embryonic stem cells (lines WA01 and UC06). In vivo studies will use a preclinical heterotopic bone implantation model to examine the in vivo bone forming capacity of hMSC. Mathematical modeling will be used to describe kinetics of BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation, and Bayesian learning will be used to discover signaling networks that are unique to BMP6-induced osteoblast differentiation. The completion of this five-year project will not only demonstrate the utility of BMP6 therapeutically to control hMSC osteoblast differentiation, but will also reveal novel signaling and transcriptional networks that govern hMC osteoblast differentiation. Long term, the identity of novel targets will lead to the development of enhanced therapeutic options for directing hMSC differentiation in tissue engineered constructs to repair bone.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal application for a Center to prepare adult stem/progenitor cells from the bone marrow of human volunteers and rodents, define the quality of the cells, and then distribute them to multiple investigators. The adult stem/progenitor cells we prepare were originally referred to as fibroblastic colony forming - units, then as marrow stromal cells in the hematological literature, subsequently as mesenchymal stem cells, and most recently as multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells or MSCs. Since its establishment in June of 2003, the Center has made 451 shipments of 1,013 vials of frozen MSCs to 220 individual investigators, 129 of which are NIH funded (Appendix A). An additional 41 investigators have submitted MTAs to receive MSCs; of which 14 are NIH funded. A total of 114 investigators have provided letters of support for this competing renewal application. The Specific Aims are: 1. To continue to produce standardized preparations of human MSCs (hMSCs) for distribution to other investigators. 2. To continue to provide similarly characterized preparations of rat MSCs (rMSCs) for distribution to other investigators. 3. To continue to provide similar preparations of mouse MSCs (moMSCs) for distribution to other investigators. 4. To develop improved methods for isolating and characterizing hMSCs. The need for experiments with fully characterized MSCs has become critical with the current efforts by us and others to initiate Phase I and Phase II clinical trials with MSCs.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
The goal of this application is to expand upon the scientific skills of this applicant ultimately producing an independent investigator capable of a lifetime of clinically relevant scientific contributions. The project described below focuses on the role of alpha3beta1 integrin in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and pulmonary fibrosis. This applicant has already spent several years studying pulmonary fibrosis, both as a resident and clinical fellow. During these years, this applicant has mastered several basic research techniques. While the studies described below will allow further refinement and the gain of several new techniques, we believe that the pursuit of becoming an independent investigator involves considerable conceptual training in critical thought, innovation, scientific writing, mentoring and the ability to establish collaborations. Thus, the career development plan will include focused course work, participation in a number of scientific meetings and collaboration with other investigators. During the past two years we have been exploring the mechanism by which alpha3betal regulates TGFbeta1, a critical cytokine in the pathogenesis of fibrosis and a key regulator of EMT. We have also developed tools for further investigation, including two compound transgenic mouse systems. The first is a doxycycline-inducible, alveolar epithelial cell (AEC)-specific loss of alpha3beta1. The second system involves doxycycline-inducible, AEC-specific and permanent expression of a reporter gene, allowing us to track the fate of these cells as they potentially differentiate into mesenchymal cells. Both of these mice are already available and the systems have been verified by multiple techniques. Furthermore, we have mastered techniques at isolating and culturing primary AECs and have already used these tools to demonstrate AEC transition into mesenchymal cells and to support a critical role for alpha3beta1 in regulating this process. The scientific goals during this award period will be to explore the function of alpha3beta1 in AECs, determine the factors which regulate EMT, and  
to determine the importance of alpah3beta1 and EMT in animal models of pulmonary fibrosis. Despite years of research, pulmonary fibrosis remains a devastating problem without good therapy. With greater understanding into this relatively unexplored pathway, a new paradigm for the pathogenesis of fibrosis may emerge with the potential for novel and more effective therapies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and weight gain are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and affect a sizable and increasing population in the U.S. and other developed countries. Obesity is characterized by an increase in adipose tissue mass due to hypertrophy of existing fat cells and the generation of new adipocytes. It has been tacitly assumed that new adipocytes arise solely from resident adipose tissue preadipocytes or interstitial mesenchymal cells. However, preliminary data from my laboratory shows that bone marrow (BM)-derived circulating progenitor cells differentiate into a de novo population of adipocytes in the adipose tissue of mice. These novel adipocytes express conventional adipocyte markers, have multiple lipid droplets like brown adipocytes, but lack uncoupling protein-1, a brown adipocyte marker. These new multilocular (ML) adipocytes also exhibit high mitochondrial content, suggesting a potential role for these cells in oxidative fuel disposal. The number of ML adipocytes is increased by the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone (ROSI) or high fat feeding. Based on these results we hypothesize that thiazolidinediones and high fat feeding increase the trafficking of mesenchymal progenitor/stem cells to adipose tissue and promote their differentiation to multilocular adipocytes that participate in adipose tissue function. Four Specific Aims will test this hypothesis. The first Aim will test whether BM-derived mesenchymal and hematopoietic progenitor cells give rise to ML adipocytes, and determine whether the progenitor cells exhibit stem cell characteristics. The second Aim will investigate the mechanism(s) by which TZDs and high fat feeding promote the appearance of ML adipocytes from BM- derived progenitor cells. Specific Aim 3 is a proof-of-principle aim that will determine whether BM-derived ML adipocytes from wild type mice can reconstitute leptin production in leptin-deficient recipient mice. Finally, Aim 4 will test whether ML adipocytes exhibit higher rates of fatty acid uptake, esterification and/or oxidation than conventional white and brown adipocytes. Successful testing of this hypothesis will demonstrate the importance of non-resident cells in the development of adipose tissue. We predict that the novel ML adipocytes will have a beneficial impact on adipose tissue function and global energy metabolism via the release of leptin and by increasing adipose fatty acid oxidation. These experiments should also reveal mechanisms for regulating the recruitment and differentiation of BM-derived progenitor cells to ML adipocytes. Such mechanisms could then form the basis for novel therapies to treat or prevent obesity, diabetes and related conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity and weight gain are associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and affect a sizable and increasing population in the U.S. Obesity is characterized by an increase in fat tissue mass due to growth of existing fat cells and the generation of new fat cells. It has been assumed that new fat cells arise solely from progenitor cells that reside within fat tissue. However, preliminary data from my laboratory shows that bone marrow-derived progenitor cells can become new fat cells in the fat tissue of mice. The research proposed in this application will explore the mechanisms that control the formation of new fat cells from bone marrow- derived progenitor cells, and investigate the role of the new fat cells in the function of fat tissue. Successful testing of this hypothesis will demonstrate the importance of non-resident cells in the development of fat tissue. These experiments should also reveal mechanisms for regulating the formation of new fat cells from bone marrow progenitor cells. Such mechanisms could then form the basis for novel therapies to treat or prevent obesity, diabetes and related conditions.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
We have obtained pilot data demonstrating that tracheal aspirates from week-old premature infants undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) contain colony-forming fibroblast- like cells with surface markers and differentiation potential typically found in mesenchymal stem cells. The cells are positive for Stro-1, CD73, CD90, CD105 and CD166, but negative for CD34, CD45 and CD11b, suggesting that they are of stromal but not hematopoietic origin. Further, they exhibit ample proliferative capacity and are capable of differentiation into osteocytes, adipocytes and myofibroblasts. Conditioned medium from these cells enhances epithelial growth and repair, inhibits squamous differentiation and contains basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF-2), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF). Finally, the isolation of multipotent mesenchymal cells from the tracheal aspirates of premature infants with RDS is associated with a prolonged requirement for supplemental 02 and the development of chronic lung disease, i.e., bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We therefore hypothesize that multipotent lung mesenchymal cells participate in neonatal lung repair and are a biomarker for lung injury. To test this general hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims.  Specific Aim 1: Determine mechanisms by which multipotent lung mesenchymal cells from premature infants are recruited to the airspaces. We hypothesize that epithelial injury induces expression of bFGF and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, thereby promoting lung mesenchymal cell migration to the airspaces. Specific Aim 2: Characterize potential mechanisms by which multipotent lung mesenchymal cells participate in lung repair. We hypothesize that: 1) lung mesenchymal cells produce trophic factors capable of promoting respiratory epithelial repair; 2) when stimulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-fl, lung mesenchymal cells differentiate into myofibroblasts, thereby promoting angiogenesis and fibrogenesis.  Specific Aim 3: Correlate the presence of multipotent lung mesenchymal cells in premature infants with the development and severity of chronic lung disease. We hypothesize that multipotent lung mesenchymal cells are biomarkers for lung injury and persistent pulmonary dysfunction. We will prospectively compare the clinical outcomes of premature infants from whom multipotent lung mesenchymal cells have been isolated with those from whom cells are not isolated, focusing on respiratory system compliance and days of oxygen supplementation. Understanding the role of multipotent lung mesenchymal cells in the pathogenesis of BPD will lead to improvements in the treatment of this disease.","18540",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past funding period, we have performed novel studies demonstrating an important role for Wnt signaling as an inhibitor of adipogenesis in cultured preadipocytes and in transgenic mice. Our studies have demonstrated that Wnt10b is expressed in preadipocytes and stromal vascular cells and decreases rapidly upon induction of adipogenesis. Further, we found that Wnt10b regulates adipogenesis through suppression of C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma and that inhibition of endogenous Wnt10b with neutralizing antisera stimulates adipogenesis of cultured preadipocytes. Transgenic mice expressing Wnt10b in adipose tissue have reduced adipose tissue. FABP4-Wnt10b mice consuming a high fat diet are resistant to diet-induced and genetic-obesity, and these mice are more glucose-tolerant and insulin-sensitive than controls. Our studies have also expanded the role for Wnt10b from simple inhibition of preadipocyte differentiation to modulating fate of multipotent stem cells. Thus, FABP4-Wnt10b mice have a four-fold increase in trabecular bone. This appears to be a direct effect of Wnt10b to stimulate osteoblastogenesis and decrease adipogenesis of resident mesenchymal progenitor cells in marrow. Further support for a critical role for Wnt10b in governing fate of mesenchymal precursors comes from our observations that Wnt10b -/- mice have  approximately 30% less trabecular bone and a corresponding decrease in serum osteoblast markers. Although we have made considerable progress in our studies on the effects of Wnt signaling on adipogenesis, how autocrine and paracrine signals in cultured cells and adipose tissue regulate endogenous Wnt signaling remains unknown. In this competitive renewal of DK51563, we propose experiments to test the hypotheses that Wnt activity in precursor cells is comprised of competing contributions from multiple Wnts and secreted frizzled-related proteins (sFRP) in preadipocytes and adipocytes, and that Wnt signaling inhibits adipogenesis by repressing the expression and/or activity of PPARgamma. Thus, the specific aims of this grant application are to: Specific Aim 1: Investigate activity and regulation of Wnt signaling molecules including Wnts, Fzd, and sFRPs. Specific Aim 2: Investigate mechanisms whereby Wnt signaling inhibits expression of PPARgamma. Successful completion of these specific aims will provide important insight into fat cell differentiation and metabolism, and provide insight into the medical problems of obesity and type II diabetes, two major health risks in the United States.

structural remodeling are observed. The latter process includes abnormal muscularization of resistance PA
in the lung periphery, as well as medial hypertrophy, adventitial thickening and fibrosis in more proximal PA.
The causes of abnormal pulmonary vascular development and structural remodeling in BPD are poorly
understood. It has long been assumed that the expanded population of cells in the thickened PA originates
via proliferation of resident lung fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (SMC), as well as via differentiation of
resident lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. However, new experimental evidence suggests a non-resident
source for tissue mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, SMC). Among different types of
mesenchymal progenitors, a subpopulation of circulating leukocytes, termed fibrocytes, has been proposed
as a major contributor to the structural tissue remodeling and fibrosis in healing wounds, bleomycin-induced
lung injury, and asthma. We have recently demonstrated the robust PA accumulation of fibrocytes in chronic
hypoxic neonatal pulmonary hypertension and showed that these circulating cells are crucial for the
pulmonary vascular structural remodeling seen in that setting. Our preliminary data suggest that circulating
fibrocytes also contribute to the vascular remodeling observed in neonatal rats and mice exposed to
hyperoxia (animal models of BPD). Preliminary data support a role for oxidant imbalances and endothelin in
the recruitment of fibrocytes to the lung. We therefore propose to test the overall hypothesis that, in the
setting of hyperoxia-induced lung injury, circulating fibrocytes are recruited to the lung where they act as
progenitors of mesenchymal cells, and contribute significantly to pulmonary vascular remodeling and
pulmonary hypertension, and that EC-SOD and ET-1 play critical roles in this process. We will determine the
mechanisms involved in the recruitment of fibrocytes to the lung and lung vasculature and their contribution
to remodeling using both pharmacologic strategies and genetic models to manipulate expression of
molecules potentially involved in fibrocyte recruitment and differentiation. These experiments will result in a
better understanding of vascular changes in BPD and, ultimately in the development of selective therapeutic
strategies to decrease the recruitment of circulating mesenchymal progenitors to the hyperoxic lung in
 human infants with BPD."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
We have obtained pilot data demonstrating that tracheal aspirates from week-old premature infants undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) contain colony-forming fibroblast- like cells with surface markers and differentiation potential typically found in mesenchymal stem cells. The cells are positive for Stro-1, CD73, CD90, CD105 and CD166, but negative for CD34, CD45 and CD11b, suggesting that they are of stromal but not hematopoietic origin. Further, they exhibit ample proliferative capacity and are capable of differentiation into osteocytes, adipocytes and myofibroblasts. Conditioned medium from these cells enhances epithelial growth and repair, inhibits squamous differentiation and contains basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF-2), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF). Finally, the isolation of multipotent mesenchymal cells from the tracheal aspirates of premature infants with RDS is associated with a prolonged requirement for supplemental 02 and the development of chronic lung disease, i.e., bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We therefore hypothesize that multipotent lung mesenchymal cells participate in neonatal lung repair and are a biomarker for lung injury. To test this general hypothesis, we propose the following Specific Aims.  Specific Aim 1: Determine mechanisms by which multipotent lung mesenchymal cells from premature infants are recruited to the airspaces. We hypothesize that epithelial injury induces expression of bFGF and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, thereby promoting lung mesenchymal cell migration to the airspaces. Specific Aim 2: Characterize potential mechanisms by which multipotent lung mesenchymal cells participate in lung repair. We hypothesize that: 1) lung mesenchymal cells produce trophic factors capable of promoting respiratory epithelial repair; 2) when stimulated by transforming growth factor (TGF)-fl, lung mesenchymal cells differentiate into myofibroblasts, thereby promoting angiogenesis and fibrogenesis.  Specific Aim 3: Correlate the presence of multipotent lung mesenchymal cells in premature infants with the development and severity of chronic lung disease. We hypothesize that multipotent lung mesenchymal cells are biomarkers for lung injury and persistent pulmonary dysfunction. We will prospectively compare the clinical outcomes of premature infants from whom multipotent lung mesenchymal cells have been isolated with those from whom cells are not isolated, focusing on respiratory system compliance and days of oxygen supplementation. Understanding the role of multipotent lung mesenchymal cells in the pathogenesis of BPD will lead to improvements in the treatment of this disease.","342000",

In general most contrast agents used for cell labeling are superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) that result in T2 and T2 shortening of the surrounding tissues and hypointense regions on T2 weighted MRI. Paramagnetic contrast agents based on gadolinium can be used to label cells. Two approaches were developed to fuse high affinity Gd3 chelating moieties to the surface of the Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) capsid. In the first approach, a metal binding peptide has been genetically engineered into the subunit of CCMV. In a second approach GdDOTA was attached to CCMV by reactions with endogenous lysine residues on the surface of the viral capsid. T1 and T2 ionic relaxivity rates for the genetic fusion particle 50100x greater than GdDOTA. The combination of high relaxivity, stable Gd3 binding and large Gd3 payloads indicates the potential of protein cages as high performance contrast agents and the possibility to modify these agents to increase binding to target cells following intravenous injection. Further research using recombinant self assembly proteins with iron or gadolinium cores may be useful as contrast agents for cellular imaging. Multifunctional fluorescent and SPIO nanoparticle contrast agents provides the ability to track labeled cells with cellular MRI and fluorescent microscopy. Several groups have reported functionalization of dextran coated SPION but not with a simple approach. We have developed a simple oxidation approach was used to introduce functional groups onto dextran coated SPION allowing for the reaction of the nanoparticles with several different fluorescent dyes. The fluorescent SPION were stable and successfully used for cell labeling. HeLa cells and mesenchymal stem cells were labeled with fluorescent dextran coated SPION such as fluorescent ferumoxides protamine sulfate complexes (FLUO FEPro) and quantitative cellular iron incorporation was similar to what was reported without fluorescent tag. FLUO FEPro labeled cells showed stronger fluorescent images confirming successful fluorescent dye conjugation onto dextrancoated SPION.","264681",

DESCRIPTION: PROJECT 2
Aristolochic acid (AA), the principal component of plants belonging to the genus Aristolochiae, is a potent
human nephrotoxin and carcinogen. Its toxic effects are targeted primarily to the renal proximal tubule where
it causes cellular injury leading to cortical tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and ultimately, chronic renal failure. The
pathology of this nephropathy is well defined but little is known about the biochemical mechanisms by which
AA exerts its nephrotoxic action or how it promotes organ specific carcinogenesis. We hypothesize that AA
and/or one of its metabolites act through two separate and distinct cellular mechanisms; namely, (a)
transporter-mediated concentration and metabolism in renal proximal tubule cells, where the toxin induces
tubular injury; and (b) by reacting with DMAto form dA- and dG-AA adducts that initiate neoplastic change in
urothelial cells. A spectrum of experimental models including whole animal, perfused kidney, isolated renal
proximal tubules, and cell culture will be used to identify mechanisms for renal handling of AA and the
biochemical pathways used for AA metabolic transformation(s). We will take advantage of naturally occurring
mouse strains that are sensitive or resistant to AA toxicity to identify processes associated with relative
susceptibility. Isolated perfused rat kidneys, renal proximal tubules isolated from mouse and human kidney,
and cell culture models, will be used to examine mechanisms by which AA and its metabolites are
transported by, and exert their toxic effects, in the proximal tubule, with a focus on defining the roles of
mitochondria and oxidative injury in the nephrotoxic response. Pathways involved in the proximal tubule
response to AA in induction of tubulointerstitial fibrosis through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and in
the human ureteric urothelial cell response to AA as it relates to DMA damage and carcinogenesis, will be
studied by gene array expression profiling and proteomics analysis. The formation and repair of AA-DNA
adducts will be explored in vivo with mouse models of AA nephropathy, and in vitro with isolated mouse and
human tubules, and human ureteric urothelial cell cultures, with an emphasis on defining mechanisms
related to AA nephro- and genotoxicity. Finally, we will identify genes and enzymes involved in activation and
detoxification of AA and its metabolites, with the thought that genetic polymorphisms may predispose certain
individuals to AA nephropathy and/or urothelial cell cancer by altering the expression or function of these
enzymes."," ",

The goal of our research program is to determine molecular mechanisms whereby
extracellular signals regulate adipocyte differentiation and metabolism. In the past
funding period, we have performed novel studies demonstrating an important role for
Wnt10b signaling as an inhibitor of adipogenesis in cultured preadipocytes and in
transgenic mice. Our studies have demonstrated that Wnt10b is expressed in
preadipocytes and stromal vascular cells and that Wnt10b decreases rapidly upon
induction of adipogenesis. Wnt10b blocks adipogenesis by inhibiting expression of
C/EBPa and PPAR?, and neutralization of endogenous Wnt10b with antisera stimulates
adipogenesis of preadipocytes. Transgenic mice expressing Wnt10b in adipose tissue
(FABP4-Wnt10b) have ~50% less total body fat and a ~60% reduction in visceral fat
depots. FABP4-Wnt10b mice are resistant to diet-induced and genetic-obesity, and
these mice are more glucose-tolerant and insulin-sensitive than controls. Our studies
have expanded the role for Wnt10b from simple inhibition of preadipocyte differentiation
to modulating fate of multipotent stem cells. Thus, FABP4-Wnt10b mice not only have
less adipose tissue, but they have a four-fold increase in trabecular bone. In addition to a
direct effect of Wnt10b to stimulate osteoblastogenesis and decrease adipogenesis of
resident mesenchymal progenitor cells in marrow, increased osteoblast activity also
appears to be mediated by a novel mechanism through mammalian target of rapamycin
and protein translation. Further support for a critical role for Wnt10b in governing fate of
mesenchymal precursors comes from our observations that Wnt10b -/- mice have ~30%
less trabecular bone and a corresponding decrease in serum osteoblast markers. While
our focus to date has been on how Wnt/¿-catenin influences developmental processes,
our preliminary studies suggest that Wnt signaling has additional roles in metabolism.
These studies have led us to hypothesize that Wnt signaling is important for regulation of
adipocyte and whole body metabolism. The experiments proposed in this application will
systematically build on our past studies to understand in greater detail the molecular,
cellular and whole animal biology of Wnt signaling.","237636",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have preliminary data showing that in addition to its role in promoting osteoblast (OB) function and bone formation, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a negative regulator of mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into mature adipocytes (AD). We hypothesize that loss of FGF2 expression results in a shift of stromal mesenchymal progenitors from OB differentiation towards adipogenesis. The proposed studies will increase our understanding of the molecular mechanism (s) by which FGF2 affects aging bone as well as the role of FGF2 in the osteogenic and antiadipogenic effects of PTH in bone. Specific Aim 1: Determine how FGF2 modulates the adipocyte phenotype using Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- mice in Col3.6-GFP or aP2-GFP genetic backgrounds. We will test the hypothesis that in the absence of FGF2, marrow progenitors have a reduced ability to choose the osteogenic pathway. To assess the age-dependence of the phenotype, we will examine young adult mice at 6-8 weeks of age and compare them to 4-5 month old adult mice that already exhibit reduced bone mass. Aim 1A: i) determine the temporal and quantitative onset of GFP expression in primary bone marrow stromal cultures (BMSC) from Fgf2+/+ and Fgf2-/- mice harboring transgene reporters for the OB (Col3.6-GFP) or AD (aP2-GFP or -Cyan) lineage; ii) characterize the AD and OB potential of GFP positive and GFP negative cells isolated via FACS analysis and then cultured in the absence and presence of exogenous FGF2 and PTH; and iii) examine changes in gene and protein expression. Aim 1B: Define the function of FGF2 during osteogenic versus adipogenic differentiation in vivo. Using mice developed in Aim 1A, we will i) assess whether there is a correlation of changes in bone mineral density and whole body and bone fat content. ii) examine the expression of key adipogenic and osteoblast signaling molecules from whole bones and from freshly isolated marrow; and iii) assess the effects of PTH, administered to mice alone or in combination with FGF2 on adipogenesis in ex vivo BMSC cultures. Specific AIM 2: Determine whether FGF2 is a necessary factor for PTH-mediated pro-osteogenic and anti-adipogeneic effect on mesenchymal progenitor cells. We hypothesize that FGF2 inhibits adipogenesis through modulation of Wnt 10b and PPAR( in mesenchymal progenitors. We also hypothesize that in the absence of FGF2, PTH is unable to inhibit mesenchymal progenitor cell differentiation towards adipogenesis and this is mediated through regulation of PPAR( by Runx2 and Wnt 10b downstream effects. Aim 2A: Examine the mechanisms by which FGF2 deficiency modulates the development of the OB or AD phenotype. We will determine whether FGF2 modulates Wnt 10b and PPAR(2 activity and what signaling pathways mediate this in CFU-OB and CFU-AD from young and adult mice in vitro. Aim 2B: Define the transcriptional mechanisms underlying PPAR( regulation by PTH and FGF2 signaling. We will test the hypothesis that one possible mechanism through which FGF2 and PTH crosstalk may regulate adipogenesis is through Runx2 and Lef-1/(-catenin mediated control of the PPAR(2 promoter. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Fgf2 null mice have several characteristics of senile osteoporosis. They exhibit decreased bone mass with age, diminished bone formation and remodeling of cancellous bones, decreased osteoblastogenesis as well as osteoclastogenesis in the bone marrow compared with wild type littermates. The novel observation of increased adipogenesis in bone marrow of adult and aged Fgf2-/- associated with progressive osteopenia suggests that the Fgf2-/- mice represents a worthwhile model to study the mechanism of age related bone loss and osteoblast/adipocyte lineage determination. Increased serum FGF2 in response to PTH treatment of osteoporotic patients and impaired bone formation in response to PTH in the Fgf2- /- mice support a role for FGF2 in the pro-osteogenic, anti-adipogenic effects of PTH. Understanding the role of FGF2 in bone and the genes that are differentially regulated to stimulate bone formation and inhibit fat accumulation in bone marrow, may lead to development of useful therapeutic targets for the management of disorders associated with low bone mass.

Until recently, surgery has been the only effective therapy for patients with GIST. Despite complete resection of their tumor, most patients develop, and eventually die from, recurrent disease. The majority of GISTs possess a gain of function mutation in the KIT proto-oncogene resulting in constitutive KIT protein activation and uncontrolled cell proliferation. STI571 is a small molecule that selectively inhibits KIT and a few other tyrosine kinases. It represents a landmark achievement in cancer therapeutics. STI571 validates the field of molecular oncology as it proves that a specific inhibitor can be used to target a molecular aberration responsible for the pathogenesis of neoplasia. STI571 is effective in about two-thirds of patients with metastatic GIST. Patients with primary GIST who undergo surgical resection may benefit from adjuvant STI571 and this is the subject of an ongoing CTEP sponsored Phase III randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, intergroup trial. We propose to study the tissue specimens collected from the patients enrolled in the multicenter trial. We hypothesize that the molecular characteristics of primary GIST predict the clinical outcome after adjuvant STI571 therapy. Furthermore, we postulate that subsequent molecular changes in recurrent GIST will reveal the mechanism of STI571 resistance in GIST. In Aim 1, we will correlate specific pathologic (tumor site and size) and cytogenetic (gains of 5p, 17q, or 20q or loss of 9p) phenotype of primary GIST to recurrence and survival. Aim 2 focuses on the relationship of KIT mutation status of primary GIST to recurrence and survival. In Aim 3, we will compare the pathologic and molecular features of primary GIST to recurrent GIST to begin to define the molecular mechanisms of STI571 resistance. The proposed experiments represent the first prospective clinical and pathologic study of primary GIST and will reveal the natural history of GIST (placebo arm) as well as the response to an adjuvant therapy (STI571 arm). The data will set the standard for future clinicopathologic studies in primary GIST and may provide approaches to treat patients with GIST who become resistant to STI571. The results will further define GIST biology and be applicable to other diseases treated with molecular agents.","573359",

cells from dental and periodontal tissues. Recently, human postnatal dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have
been identified from dental pulp tissues. These cells are multipotent and can generate dentin/pulp-like
complexes in vivo. Our exciting preliminary studies presented in this application also discovered that human
periodontal ligament (PDL) contains unique stem cells (periodontal ligament stem cells; PDLSCs) which can
generate a distinct cementum/PDL-like structure. These human postnatal dental and periodontal stem cells
offer an attractive regenerative therapy for dental and periodontal defects caused by dental decay/pulpitisand
periodontitis. However, before pushing them into clinical application, it is critical to develop optimal
conditions to maintain their sternness during ex vivo expansion and to elucidate molecular mechanisms
which control their differentiation and self-renewal. Like bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
these human postnatal dental stem cells appear to be from mesenchymal origin according to their surface
markers. During in vitro culture, we also found that these stem cells, similar to MSCs, progressively lost their
sternness. Based on our novel findings on the maintenance of MSCs' function by telomerase, in this
application, we will examine whether over-expression of telomerases help to maintain human postnatal
dental stem cell properties in vitro and whether Wnt growth factors stimulate telomerase activity and
modulate their properties. Moreover, our preliminary studies suggest that Wnt signaling may negatively
regulate the activation of NF-icB, a master transcription factor of inflammatory responses, and that NF-KB
activated by inflammatory mediators such as TNF inhibit differentiation. Therefore, in this application, we
will also explore whether Wnt signaling attenuates the inhibition of human dental stem cell differentiation by
TNF. In the realm of therapeutic regeneration for dental and periodontal tissues, due to infection of oral
pathogens, the repairing sites are frequently inflamed. Thus, our studies are highly clinically-relevant.
Collectively, novel findings from our application will provide a molecular basis for maintaining and
regulating human postnatal dental stem cell properties in vitro and in vivo, and have important implications
in the regenerative dental medicine.","361033",

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs during normal embryonic development and epithelial tumor progression. Several factors associated with EMT contribute to motility, invasion, and angiogenesis, and may be important therapeutic targets for prostate cancer metastasis. Understanding the factors that contribute to EMT and prostate cancer metastasis is crucial for development of cancer therapies. For example, Snail transcription factor has been identified as an important factor that can induce EMT in breast and colon cancer.  However, the role of EMT in prostate cancer is not well defined and good EMT models are lacking. Recently we have established an EMT model for prostate cancer progression using the ARCaP cell model overexpressing Snail. The goal of this proposal is to study the role of Snail transcription factor in prostate cancer progression and metastasis. We have found that Snail-induced EMT in prostate cancer cells involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) and receptor activator of NFkB (RANKL), two factors that are important in cancer disease progression and bone metastatic lesions, respectively. This proposal will elucidate the biological significance of Snail, with emphasis of its role in prostate cancer bone metastasis. In addition, we will characterize the signaling pathway of Snail-induced EMT, and finally examine the effect of antagonizing Snail expression on tumor aggressiveness in vitro and in vivo. We believe these studies will identify Snail as an attractive therapeutic target not only for EMT during primary tumor progression but also for bone metastatic lesions at the secondary site."," ",

The goal of our research program is to determine molecular mechanisms whereby
extracellular signals regulate adipocyte differentiation and metabolism. In the past
funding period, we have performed novel studies demonstrating an important role for
Wnt10b signaling as an inhibitor of adipogenesis in cultured preadipocytes and in
transgenic mice. Our studies have demonstrated that Wnt10b is expressed in
preadipocytes and stromal vascular cells and that Wnt10b decreases rapidly upon
induction of adipogenesis. Wnt10b blocks adipogenesis by inhibiting expression of
C/EBPa and PPAR?, and neutralization of endogenous Wnt10b with antisera stimulates
adipogenesis of preadipocytes. Transgenic mice expressing Wnt10b in adipose tissue
(FABP4-Wnt10b) have ~50% less total body fat and a ~60% reduction in visceral fat
depots. FABP4-Wnt10b mice are resistant to diet-induced and genetic-obesity, and
these mice are more glucose-tolerant and insulin-sensitive than controls. Our studies
have expanded the role for Wnt10b from simple inhibition of preadipocyte differentiation
to modulating fate of multipotent stem cells. Thus, FABP4-Wnt10b mice not only have
less adipose tissue, but they have a four-fold increase in trabecular bone. In addition to a
direct effect of Wnt10b to stimulate osteoblastogenesis and decrease adipogenesis of
resident mesenchymal progenitor cells in marrow, increased osteoblast activity also
appears to be mediated by a novel mechanism through mammalian target of rapamycin
and protein translation. Further support for a critical role for Wnt10b in governing fate of
mesenchymal precursors comes from our observations that Wnt10b -/- mice have ~30%
less trabecular bone and a corresponding decrease in serum osteoblast markers. While
our focus to date has been on how Wnt/¿-catenin influences developmental processes,
our preliminary studies suggest that Wnt signaling has additional roles in metabolism.
These studies have led us to hypothesize that Wnt signaling is important for regulation of
adipocyte and whole body metabolism. The experiments proposed in this application will
systematically build on our past studies to understand in greater detail the molecular,
cellular and whole animal biology of Wnt signaling.","225346",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a program of events characterized by loss of cell polarity, enhanced cell motility, and increased cell invasion. While this process is essential for normal embryonic development, its deregulation in the adult promotes metastasis. The broad, long term objectives of this proposal are to understand how the epithelial to mesenchymal transition initiates the loss of cellular polarity and how this depolarization might contribute to cancer progression. The central hypothesis is that the transcriptional represser Snail, a key regulator of the EMT, affects the apico-basal polarity complexes Crumbs3-PALS1-PATJ and Par6-Par3-aPKC and that loss of these polarity complexes enhances cancer progression. This hypothesis is based on the long-appreciated observation that the epithelium appears depolarized in many carcinomas, and on data from model organisms demonstrating that loss of proper epithelial architecture results in profound hyperproliferation. Previous work from this laboratory and others has revealed that the Crumbs and Par6 polarity complexes are required for the formation of the tight junction and maintenance of cell polarity. Based on these observations, the experimental focus of this proposal is on the novel Crumbs and Par6 epithelial polarity complexes during EMT. The specific aims are to: (1) Elucidate the specific defects in apico-basal polarity complexes induced by Snail expression in epithelial cells. The study will examine how Snail affects the localization and protein levels of the polarity complexes, if it reduces the expression of the tight junction component genes, if E-cadherin expression can rescue the polarization defects, and if elevated levels of Snail correlate with the suppression of E-cadherin and CrumbsS in human tumor samples. (2) Analyze the biological effects of Snail-induced depolarization in epithelial cells and evaluate whether selective re- expression of CrumbsS modulates proper biological function. The study will investigate if Snail disrupts other cellular processes closely associated with cell polarity such as mitotic spindle pole alignment and cell migration, if re-expression of CrumbsS reverses any functionally altered phenotypes, and whether the specific loss of CrumbsS modulates cancer cell growth or migration. Biochemical, genetic, proteomic, and microscopy-based methods will be used to address these aims. The relevance of this project to public health is that it will further our understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms resulting in cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis and potentially identify new targets for cancer therapy.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells that differentiate into many of the cells resident in musculoskeletal and stromal tissues of the human body, including fibroblasts, chondrocytes, osteoblasts, myocytes, and adipocytes. While differentiation of the MSCs into appropriate lineages may enhance healing of injured tissues, inappropriate lineage specification may be responsible for numerous pathophysiologic processes, including the decreased bone and increased fat in osteoporotic bones, and the calcification of atherosclerotic vessel walls. Regulation of the lineage commitment of MSCs by local microenvironmental cues therefore may be critical to our fundamental understanding of numerous degenerative as well as healing processes. The long term objective of this research is to characterize the cues within the local surrounding microenvironment that drive the lineage specification and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and the molecular pathways involved. The investigator has recently discovered that adhesion of MSCs to fibronectin regulates a commitment switch in the MSCs between adipogenic and osteogenic lineage specification, through a mechanism involving RhoA signaling and cytoskeletal tension. In this proposal, the investigator proposes to further characterize how adhesive and mechanical cues regulate the commitment of MSCs to osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Specific Aim 1 will be to investigate the role of integrin-mediated cell adhesion in modulating mesenchymal stem cell commitment by characterizing the binding interactions that drive the MSC lineage commitment switch between osteoblasts and adipocytes. Specific Aim 2 will be to investigate the coordination of RhoA and cytoskeletal tension in the regulation of stem cell commitment. Specific Aim 3 will be to investigate the ability of RhoA to regulate stem cell commitment and differentiation in an animal model. Together, these studies will define roles of cell adhesion, RhoA, and cytoskeletal tension in MSC lineage commitment, and establish a molecular basis for the regulation of MSC differentiation by microenvironmental cues.

Normal
epithelial architecture/polarity is critical to maintain the delicate balance between a cell and its
microenvironment; disruption of this balance can result in the aberrant cell behavior observed during
initiation and progression of carcinoma. In fact, pathologists routinely use changes in cell and tissue
architecture to understand cancer progression and make assessments for treatment options. Despite the
appreciation of the importance of cell architecture, the mechanism by which cell and tissue architecture is
disrupted in carcinoma remains poorly understood. It is likely that understanding the molecular mechanisms
by which cell and tissue and architecture is deregulated in carcinoma will not only allow us to have a better
understanding of changes in tumor microenvironment but also identify a new class of biomarkers and drug
targets.
During the past funding period we discovered that oncogenes interact with polarity regulators to
disrupt cell polarity and three-dimensional organization of epithelial structures. The interaction was
independent of the ability of oncogenes to induce cell proliferation. Surprisingly, the oncogene-polarity
genes interaction was required for protecting cells from apoptosis. Thus, polarity genes play important roles
in carcinoma. They are required for oncogenes to induce changes in cell and tissue architecture and for
protecting cells from death. I think we have just begun to scrape the ice, much remains to be understood on
the molecular mechanisms by which polarity pathways cooperate with oncogenes during initiation and
progression of carcinoma.
In this proposal we build on our results from the previous funding period to address the following: 1)
Develop a deeper understanding of the mechanism by which ErbB2 interacts with polarity pathways; (2)
Determine how polarity pathways protects cells from apoptosis and what roles does this play during
development of drug resistance (3) Determine how polarity pathways cooperate with ErbB2 to promote
epithelial to mesenchymal transition and malignant progression.
Thus the goal of this proposal is to take a new perspective - understand carcinoma initiation and
progression as a function of deregulated cell polarity pathways.","240000",

Most studies on the biological effects of nanoparticles focused on the activities of functional components, such as drugs, proteins, antibodies, etc., conjugated to the nanoparticles. More recently, some naked nanoparticles were found to be cytotoxic and affect cellular activities. Envirox, a trade name for naked cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticle used as a diesel fuel additive, has been demonstrated to reduce fuel consumption and the emission of carbon dioxide and particulate from vehicles.  However the health impact of CeO2 nanoparticles is poorly understood.  To generate a detailed, unbiased assessment of the molecular responses to CeO2 nanoparticles (CeO-6, 6 nm), we conducted a genomic study to identify gene expression signatures associated with nanoparticle exposure in a murine neuronal cell (HT22) model. We controlled for the effect of particle size using 1000 nm diameter cerium oxide (CeO-M) and for the effect of chemical property using 300 nm diameter aluminum oxide particles (AlO). We demonstrated cerium oxide nanoparticles induced chemical- and size-specific changes in the transcriptome of murine neuronal cells.  The genes whose expression is affected by the presence of CeO-6 are related to neurological disease, cell cycle control and growth.   On the other hand, similar studies with human mesenchymal stem cells revealed the induction of osteogenic factors by CeO-6.  These observations indicate that nanoparticles are capable of inducing size- and chemistry-specific changes in cells and caution the use and need for in-depth assessment of potential health risks of nanoparticle exposure.","23531",

Back pain, a significant source of morbidity in our society, is directly related to the pathology of the intervertebral disc. At present, the treatment of degenerative disc disease consists of therapies, both conservative and invasive, that are aimed at symptomatic relief. Recent advances in the understanding of tissue repair and stem cell biology have served to identify possible new approaches to rebuild diseased/degenerate tissues. Accordingly, the goal of the investigations described in this proposal is to develop a ""tissue engineering"" based approach to disc therapy. The Specific Aims of the investigation are: 1. To examine the differentiation of MSC into a nucleus pulposus-like cell; to evaluate the commitment and fate of these engineered cells in an in vitro cell and organ culture system. MSC will be maintained under conditions that enhance differentiation into a nucleus pulposus phenotype. At selected time intervals, differentiation of the disc cells towards a phenotype consistent with that of the nucleus pulposus will be assessed. We will test the hypothesis that the unique micro-environment of the intervertebral disc serves to enhance the differentiation of MSC to cells displaying a nucleus pulposus-like phenotype. 2. To isolate a notochordal population of cells from the nucleus pulposus; to examine the impact of these cells on the commitment of MSC to the nucleus pulposus phenotype. We will examine the impact of notochordal cells, isolated from the nucleus pulposus of the young rat, on the differentiation of MSC and the formation of a nucleus pulposus-like tissue. We will co-culture notochordal with the pre-differentiated MSC prior to their insertion into the nucleus pulposus cavity. We will test the hypothesis that cells of notochordal origin stimulate the expression of the nucleus pulposus phenotype. 3. To assess whether transplanted MSC can be used in vivo to repopulate the rat nucleus pulposus. Suspended in an injectable hydrogel, we will surgically transplant pre-differentiated MSC into the nucleus pulposus cavity of normal rat discs in vivo. We will evaluate the vitality of the cells and their creation of a nucleus pulposus-like tissue. Outcomes from this study will validate the in vitro studies performed in Specific Aims 1 and 2 and permit us to test the hypothesis that MSC could differentiate into nucleus pulposus-like cells in vivo.

Bone marrow derived cells (BMDC) have significant plasticity allowing them to give rise to various nonhematopoietic cell types including epithelial cells of the lung, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. These findings present tremendous possibilities for the use of cell therapy to treat tissue injury and disease. They suggest that BMDC may represent a renewable pool of epithelial precursors, and thus open new avenues for the development of treatment for currently intractable disorders. There is considerable controversy regarding the extent to which the BM to epithelial transition occurs, and whether it is due to cell:cell fusion verses cell differentiation. We hypothesize that the engraftment of BMDC as mature epithelial cells in the GI tract occurs by both fusion of hematopoietic cells mature epithelial cells and by differentiation of nonhematopoietic BM derived precursors. Corollaries to this hypothesis would be that the BM contains different populations that are capable of engraftment into epithelial cells, and that different types of tissue injury could promote engraftment of marrow derived epithelial cells via different mechanisms. In preliminary data, we have demonstrated that BMDC can become functional epithelial cells in the GI tract. Specifically, we have used mice lacking the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) as a model system for assessing engraftment of functional epithelial cells in the GI tract. Using this model, we will test the hypotheses that HSC and cells derived therefrom become epithelial cells only through fusion, and that nonhematopoietic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can differentiate into GI epithelial cells without fusion. Engraftment of BMDC as functional epithelial cells could facilitate healing in response to tissue injury. The data obtained will lead us to design novel therapeutic strategies tissue injury and disease.

This Cell Biology Core has major resources available that are provided to the program project investigators,
including melanocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
cells, melanoma cells, monoclonal antibodies to melanoma-associated antigens, adenoviral and lentiviral
vectors for growth factors, adhesion molecules, and oncogenes.
Three-dimensional cultures of normal human skin (skin equivalents, organotypic cultures of skin) with a
'dermis' of fibroblasts embedded in collagen and an 'epidermis' of melanocytes/melanoma cells and
keratinocytes are generated and provided to the program investigators. This three-dimensional model is
superior to two- dimensional culture because it mimics the in vivo context for the melanocytes/melanoma
cells. For screening studies, the Core is providing a spheroid culture model that allows investigations on
melanoma cells intimately interacting with stromal cells.
The Core provides to program members orthotopic in vivo models of melanoma growth. Due to the different
architectures between mouse and human skin, melanomas, including xenografted cells, cannot be grown in
the natural murine skin environment. Instead, the Core will first graft human skin onto immunodeficient mice.
When the skin has healed, we will inject human melanoma cells intradermally, where growth and invasion
occurs in the same way as in patients' lesions. The Core is also providing the subcutaneous melanoma
growth model for standard experiments. Besides providing resources to the other projects, the Core will test
compounds developed in Projects 3 and 4 and initially selected in Project 1. The responsibility of the Core is
in testing expanded number of cell lines, in quality control testing of compounds through the different
biological assays and through Western blotting. The Core also trains investigators of the Program in all
tumor biological assays. Overall, this Core will provide efficient and high quality service to all interested
laboratories within this Program Project."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regeneration of articular cartilage damaged either by disease or injury is a complex problem that remains a significant clinical challenge despite extensive orthopaedic research. Although there are numerous analgesics, therapeutic strategies and surgical procedures developed to address this health concern, most of the therapies are short-lived and non-remedial. The global objective of this project is to repair osteochondral defects with a multilayered construct presenting spatially controlled chondrogenic and osteogenic properties and generated from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). To this end, the following specific aims are proposed: (1) to develop 3D controlled release systems that deliver plasmid encoded transcription factors at rates and concentrations appropriate for osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and (2) to evaluate the controlled release systems created in Specific Aim 1 for their potential to generate bi-layered chondrogenic and osteogenic constructs. Osteochondral differentiation of MSCs in 3D scaffolds will be achieved through gene delivery of transcription factors Sox-5, Sox-6, Sox-9 (Sox trio) for chondrogenesis, and Runx-2 for osteogenesis. Each of these plasmids will be complexed with a novel polymeric gene delivery vector developed in our laboratory (a conjugate of branched polyethylenimine and hyaluronic acid) to increase transfection efficiency. Initially, the effect of plasmid concentration and exposure duration on osteochondral differentiation will be examined to identify the appropriate target release profiles. Electrospun, co-axial fiber mesh scaffolds will then be fabricated with the vector-plasmid complexes embedded in the core of the polymer fibers and well-established fabrication variables will be utilized to achieve the desired release profiles. Evaluation of the individual layers for the envisioned final bi-layered construct will be based upon the osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of the seeded MSCs and the generation of extracellular matrix similar to the native tissue. The studies will involve hMSCs to evaluate the initial feasibility of the proposed approach for ultimate clinical application in humans, while parallel studies will be conducted using rabbit MSCs to evaluate the appropriateness of the envisioned application of the rabbit animal model in the translational pre-clinical development of this novel approach to osteochondral tissue regeneration. The novelty of this proposal is that it utilizes (a) MSCs to circumvent the traditional problems associated with the limited availability and maintenance of differentiated cell types, (b) transcription factors encoded in plasmids to provide a broader phenotypic induction of MSCs and (c) polymeric scaffolds to provide a three dimensional support lattice for cell proliferation/differentiaton and the controlled release of gene delivery vectors. Although this proposal addresses a specific clinical need, the impact of these studies is not limited to cartilage or even orthopaedic applications. The principles proposed herein provide a means to circumvent the problems associated with the isolation and maintenance of differentiated cells. Transcription factors will potentially facilitate the use of hMSCs in a number of tissue engineering applications. Furthermore, the novel scaffold fabrication technique permits regulated delivery of multiple gene delivery vectors while providing a 3D support for cell growth. These techniques have wide-ranging applications in tissue engineering and can potentially be used to create multilayer scaffolds that mimic the zonal architecture of cartilage and other complex tissues.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congestive heart failure has generally been considered an end-stage irreversible clinical condition for which medical management is principally to relieve symptoms and slow progression. Several exciting recent studies have shown that tissue specific stem cells may have the ability to generate cells of tissues from unrelated organs. Whether this unexpected plasticity constitutes ""trans differentiation"" or whether a small population of multi potent stem cells persists in post-natal tissues is not known. Recently, there is an increased volume of reports that cellular therapy improves LV function in murine hearts with myocardial infarction. However, the cell engraftment rate is usually low and ranges from 0.3%-3% depending upon the animal models and modes of the delivery. Hence, the majority of cells transplanted to the heart do not successfully engraft. Further, most engrafted cells do not differentiate into host cardiac cell phenotypes. Therefore, methods to enhance MSCs engraftment and increase their rates of proliferation and differentiation into functioning cardiomyocytes are urgently needed. Using bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), this research proposal will examine the mechanisms of a possible cellular therapy for cardiac repair in a swine model of postinfarction LV remodeling. The functional consequences of stem cell transplantation on LV contractile function will be measured by cardiac MRI, myocardial energy metabolism and oxygenation levels measured by 31P- and 1H- MR spectroscopy, and myocardial maximum blood flow reserve by microspheres. The specific aims of this project are:   
  
SA1. To determine the efficacy of growth factor enhanced autologous MSCs transplantation at the time of infarction and whether short term beneficial effects are durable, i.e.. whether therapeutic effects present at 4 weeks will persist for -4 months post-transplantation .   
  
SA2. To determine if delayed, growth factor enhanced autologous MSCs transplantation (4 weeks post-Infarction) is more effective than transplantation at the time of infarction and whether the therapeutic effects of delayed transplantation are durable.   
  
SA3. To determine whether myocardial inlectlon a mixture of partially pre-differentiated cardlomvocvtes and endothelium (exposure to the respective differentiation protocols for 7 days before transplantation) plus growth ,' factors will have greater beneficial effects than injection of undifferentiated MSCs.   
  
SA4. To determine whether myocardial injection of banked alloqenic MSCs fplus growth factors) will have beneficial ! effects comparable to those of autoloqous MSCs.   
  
SA5. To determine whether transplantation of MSC in a thretf-dimensional porous biodegradable PEGvlated fibrin \ matrix that covalentlv binds the growth factors (HGF and IGF) will enhance the rate, of MSCs enqraftment. and therefore functional benefits.

progression of many cancers, but the reason for these differences has not been clarified. Gastric cancer is
the 2nd leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and has been strongly linked to infection with
Helicobacter pylori, a pathogen that induces chronic gastritis. Work from our laboratory employing a murine
model of Helicobacter-dependent gastric cancer has revealed that circulating bone marrow-derived stem
cells (BMDCs) are recruited to the stomach by chronic inflammation, and then undergo progression to
metaplasia, dysplasia and cancer. We have postulated that this abnormal progression is due to an ""alterred
niche"" and in a variety of mouse models there is an early and marked increase in activated myofibroblasts.
Work from our laboratory has shown that activated myofibroblasts in the inflamed stomach can be bone
marrow-derived, and that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can give rise to both myofibroblasts and gasric
epithelial progenitors. It is our hypothesis that the unique properties of cancer-associated myofibroblasts is
due in part to their origin from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. In order to investigate this
novel hypothesis regarding tumor stroma, we are proposing four specific aims. (1) In the first aim, we will
utilize trangenic reporter gene mice (alpha-SMA-RFP and collagen-EGFP/luciferase) to characterize the changes
in stroma that occur during chronic Helicobacter infection, and explore the nature of bone marrow -derived
myofibroblasts. These studies will include both microarrays and imaging (bioluminescence, optical and MRI).
(2) In the second aim, we will characterize human gastric myofibroblasts from both normal and neoplastic
tissues and examine their gene expression/proteome and study their interactions with normal and neoplastic
epithelial cells, (3) We will then test the hypothesis that BMDCs (primarily MSCs) can give rise to both
myofibroblasts and dysplastic epithelial cells, and that chronic inflammation and TGF-beta signaling are
critical to these lineage decisions. (4) Finally, we will examine the role of a key chemokine (SDF-1) in the
recruitment of BMDCs and progression to gastric cancer. Overall, these studies will clarify the role of
inflammation-dependent stem cell recruitment in the development of the abnormal stromal environment that
characterizes the earliest stages of gastric carcinogenesis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding changes to the molecular features of intestinal epithelial progenitors (IEPs) and their resident niche that occur in response to a variety of environmental and genetic insults will greatly enhance our knowledge of gut disease pathogenesis. For instance, what mechanisms result in the alteration of the normal controls for IEP proliferation during normal, physiologic wound healing? The goal of this application is to build on our recent findings that during colonic epithelial injury, the indigenous population of microbes in the gastro-intestinal tract (`microbiota') activates macrophages through toll-like receptors (TLR) that in turn appear to interact with the overlying IEPs and stimulate proliferation. Microarray analysis of laser-capture microdissected mesenchymal cells reveals a number of potential molecular mediators of the epithelial regeneration including secreted factors that stimulate proliferation and maintain epithelial basement membrane integrity. Mice with loss of function for one of these genes, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2-/- (Ptgs2) mice exhibited a profound inhibition of epithelial proliferation and cellular organization within rectal crypts when injured (similar to Myd88-/- that are defective for most TLR signaling). Exogenous addition of dimethyl-prostaglandin E2 rescued the effects of this injury in both Ptgs2-/- and Myd88-/-, indicating that Myd88 signaling is upstream of Ptgs2/PGE2. In WT and Myd88-/- mice, Ptgs2 was expressed in scattered mesenchymal cells. Surprisingly, Ptgs2 expression was not regulated by injury. Rather, in WT mice, the combination of injury and Myd88 signaling led to the repositioning of a subset of the Ptgs2-expressing stromal cells (PSCs) from the mesenchyme surrounding the middle and upper crypts to an area surrounding the crypt base adjacent to ColEPs. These findings demonstrate that Myd88 and prostaglandin signaling pathways interact to preserve epithelial proliferation during injury using a previously undescribed mechanism requiring proper cellular mobilization within the crypt niche. The goals of this proposal are to test components of our core hypothesis that macrophage derived factors drive the migration of prostaglandin synthase 2 (Ptgs2) expressing mesenchymal stromal cells (PSCs) into the regions surrounding the crypt base. This movement places PSCs in a strategic position for interaction with macrophages and the regenerating colonic epithelium. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of this project is to determine the role of macrophages and mesenchymal stem cell in colonic injury. The findings from these studies should impact our understanding of the pathogenesis of human diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease where wound healing is abnormal. In the longer term, we propose that these studies will provide the basis to develop cell-based therapeutics (using mesenchymal stem cells) for these diseases.

Development of the endocrine pancreas includes a series of early events wherein precursor cells differentiate into islets of Langerhans. We hypothesize that epigenetic marks (or chromatin modifications) of genes important in the function of differentiated islet cells are present in the islet precursor cells.  Epigenetic marks are being found to be important in other types of stem cells including embryonic stem cells.  We find that epigenetic marks associated with active genes in other systems are present on chromatin of the insulin gene in adult human islets, hIPCs and PANC-1 cells even though hIPCs and PANC-1 cells do not express insulin under normal growth conditions.  In contrast, epigenetic marks found on repressed genes are found at low levels on the insulin gene in adult islets, hIPCs and PANC-1 cells.  In preliminary experiments, we found similar chromatin modifications on the insulin gene of +++MSCs also.  We are characterizing these chromatin modifications further.  We are also delineating epigenetic changes, including chromatin modifications and DNA methylation, on other genes within these cells.  An important aspect of this work is to determine whether all or most of the genes expressed in differentiated beta cells are marked and whether these marks can be retained with long-term cell proliferation in culture or whether these marks are changed as part of a process of gene silencing during long-term culture.","301723",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have previously demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), when injected into rodent hearts following myocardial infarction (MI), enhance myocardial repair and restore cardiac function. Moreover, this protective effect is enhanced by transduction of the MSC with the cytoprotective gene Akt (Akt-MSC). Furthermore, our data showed that these cells express paracrine mediators that reduce myocardial injury. In this application we hypothesize that Akt-MSC enhance myocardial repair, in part, through its paracrine effects on angiogenesis. Indeed we have shown in our laboratory that Akt-MSCs express multiple angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF and FGF. Moreover, media collected from these cells induce endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro. Importantly, we have recently demonstrated that Akt-MSC induces neovascularization in the infarcted heart. Since it has been shown that angiogenic signals mobilize bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) that home to the ischemic myocardium, we hypothesize that (i) Akt-MSC increase angiogenesis in the post infarct heart through paracrine mechanisms and contribute to improved myocardial repair and function (ii) Akt-MSC increase angiogenesis in part through the recruitment of bone marrow derived EPCs and (iii) Akt-MSC mediated EPC recruitment is controlled by HIF 11. To test these hypotheses, we will investigate the capability of Akt-MSCs or media collected from these cells to stimulate EPC migration and tube formation in vitro and the ability to enhance neovascularization in the post infarcted heart in vivo. We will also examine the contribution of the potential Akt-MSC derived factors towards these processes. Next we will study the role of bone marrow progenitor cells in Akt-MSC induced neovascularization in ischemic myocardium in irradiated/bone marrow transplantation models using genetically marked donor cells. Moreover we will use a ""suicide"" gene delivery approache to selectively eliminate the bone marrow progenitor cells which may play a role in Akt-MSC mediated neovascularization. Finally, we will investigate the role of hypoxia and Akt regulated transcription factor HIF11 as a molecular switch which may regulate Akt-MSC induced bone marrow cell recruitment to the ischemic myocardium. These studies should help elucidate the mechanism by which Akt-MSCs provide such dramatic and long term protection of the infarcted myocardium and may identify potential therapeutic approaches.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The protective effects of adult bone marrow stem cells in the injured heart have been demonstrated, however, the exact mechanism is unknown.  In this study, we will examine the effects of these bone marrow cells in the development of new blood vessels in the infarcted heart.  Enhancement of new vessels in the heart will greatly aid in the treatment of coronary vessel disease and heart failure.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a crippling disease characterized by high mortality. Stem cell based therapies may represent a viable alternative to repair injured lung. Our laboratory has developed a reliable method based on immunodepletion to isolate mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the bone marrow of mice. MSC engraft in mouse lung, adopt alveolar epithelial (AE) type II cell phenotype, and significantly reduced the extent of inflammation and collagen deposition in response to bleomycin. MSC are characterized by their uniform expression of the CD44 antigen. CD44 is a receptor for osteopontin (OPN). Expressed at low levels in normal lung, OPN expression is greatly enhanced during lung injury and therefore, interactions between CD44 and OPN may play an important role in mediating the extent and anatomical location of MSC engraftment in lung. Following lung engraftment MSCs adopt AE type II phenotype. Whether this is the result of cell fusion or the product of a highly regulated cell differentiation program is unknown. MSCs undergo epithelial differentiation in vitro and our data has shown that this process is associated suppression of FGF2, a mitogen for MSCs, and sequential activation of the BMP receptors IA and IB. Activation of BMPR-IA instructs stem cells to commit to a particular fate and induces expression of BMPR-IB, activation of which then promotes terminal differentiation. MSCs constitutively express BMPR-IA but lack expression of BMPR-IB. We hypothesize that inhibition of FGF2 facilitates expression of BMPR-IB and promotes epithelial MSC differentiation. In addition, we hypothesize that under non-inflammatory conditions MSC engraftment may be enhanced and targeted to the lung epithelium by inducing the controlled expression of osteopontin. Finally, we postulate that exogenously administered MSCs engraft in the lung and ameliorate lung injury. Thus, MSCs may be manipulated to deliver therapeutic genes to the injured lung. To test these hypotheses we propose the following specific aims: 1) To determine the molecular mechanism that regulates differentiation of MSCs into epithelial cell fate. 2) To determine the role that CD44/osteopontin interactions play during MSC engraftment in the mouse lung. 3) To determine whether or not the systemic administration of MSCs can be used to ameliorate the fibroproliferative responses observed in the injured lung.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Emerging evidence suggests that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) results from epithelial injury and abnormal wound repair, with dysregulated epithelial-fibroblast crosstalk leading to epithelial apoptosis, matrix remodeling and progressive fibrosis. Our recent work suggests a novel paradigm in which myofibroblasts, key effector cells in matrix deposition and structural remodeling in IPF, may be derived from alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT can be viewed as an extreme form of cell plasticity characterized by loss of epithelial markers, cytoskeletal reorganization and transition to a spindle- shaped morphology concurrent with acquisition of mesenchymal markers. EMT has long been known to play a role in cellular transdifferentiation during development and tumor invasion. It is increasingly being recognized that, following epithelial stress/injury, epithelial cells can give rise to fibroblasts and thereby contribute to the pathogenesis of fibrosis by undergoing EMT. However, mechanisms underlying EMT in this context are poorly understood. Transforming growth factor (TGF-¿), implicated as a 'master switch' in induction of fibrosis, plays a pivotal role in EMT, and recent studies suggest a role for activation of the Wnt/¿-catenin pathway in AEC in IPF. A demonstrated role for ¿-catenin signaling in EMT in the context of development and tumor progression, and the central role of TGF-¿ in EMT and IPF, suggest that interactions between these two pathways may be a major factor mediating EMT in AEC. The overall goal of this proposal is to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying EMT in AEC, focusing on crosstalk between TGF-¿ and Wnt/¿-catenin pathways. Our main hypotheses are that 1) EMT in AEC involves interactions between TGF-¿ and Wnt/¿-catenin pathways, 2) TGF-¿-induced EMT in AEC is Smad-dependent and 3) modulation of EMT in AEC will provide new therapeutic approaches to management of patients with IPF. These hypotheses will be investigated by addressing the following Specific Aims: 1) Explore the role of Wnt/¿-catenin pathway in EMT in AEC; 2) Investigate Smad-dependence of TGF-¿-induced EMT in AEC; 3) Characterize interactions between Wnt/¿-catenin and TGF-¿ pathways in mediating EMT in AEC; and, 4) Investigate effects of modulation of Wnt/¿-catenin pathway on EMT in AEC. We will utilize well-characterized in vitro models of AEC differentiation (in which phenotype can be experimentally modulated), established animal models of fibrosis and EMT, and lung tissue from patients with IPF to investigate the role of these interactions in EMT in AEC and its relevance to human disease. Understanding the precise molecular interactions that lead to EMT promises to lead to identification of novel therapeutic targets for pulmonary fibrosis that could inhibit progression of this devastating disease and provide new therapeutic options for management of patients with IPF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disorder of unknown etiology with no effective treatment. We recently demonstrated that lung epithelial lining cells may themselves contribute to fibrosis by changing into fibroblasts through a process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), suggesting that strategies for interrupting/preventing EMT could be of benefit in IPF. Understanding the molecules/signals that activate EMT should lead to development of novel strategies for treatment of IPF and other fibrotic lung disorders.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute myocardial infarction (Ml) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Novel therapeutic strategies involving autologous cell transplantation are being studied, and recently, elegant studies have shown significant regeneration of myocardial tissue by transplantation of autologous stem cells during the peri-infarct period (days following Ml). We have recently shown that the stem cell homing molecule stromal-cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is transiently expressed following Ml, and that re-establishment of SDF-1 expression in myocardial tissue months after Ml via the delivery of cells engineered to express SDF-1 is sufficient to induce stem cell homing of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), vasculogenesis and recovery of myocardial function without the generation of new cardiac myocytes (Lancet 362:697-703, 2003). These observations have led us to hypothesize that a viable strategy for myocardial regeneration in acute Ml and ischemic cardiomyopathy is the overexpression or re-establishment of signaling for stem cell homing to myocardial tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) do home to injured myocardium within days of an Ml and are believed to be more likely to differentiate into cardiac myocytes than HSCs, but they do not express CXCR4. Since MSCs have been shown to mobilize in experimental models of bone marrow injury, and MSC do home to injured myocardium in the peri-infarct period other homing and mobilization factors must be present. We hypothesize that in order to optimize recovery of myocardial function following Ml or in patients with congestive heart failure we need to reestablish both HSC and MSC homing. The overall objectives of this proposal are to test strategies for expressing stem cell homing factors for myocardial regeneration in a model of ischemic cardiomyopathy (Aim 1), identify molecular triggers that lead to homing of bone marrow derived MSCs (Aim 2), and determine if engineering expression of CXCR4 in MSCs leads to homing in response to SDF-1 and a cell survival advantage in vivo (Aim 3).

Estren has been shown to have distinct biologic effects compared to estradiol. Unlike estradiol, estren has no effect on female or male reproductive organs but increases serum osteocalcin, cortical width, and bone mineral density of ovariectomized females above the level of the estrogen-replete controls. In view of estren's distinct skeletal profile, versus classical estrogen or other anti-remodeling agents, the postulate that the superior effects of estren must result not only from its favorable effect on bone cell apoptosis, but also from additional mechanisms, will be tested. In studies leading directly to this application, the hypothesis that, unlike estradiol, estren may promote the commitment and/or differentiation of osteoblast progenitors, was explored. Estren induced lineage commitment and differentiation toward osteoblasts via ER-/AR-dependent, kinase-mediated potentiation of BMP-2 and Wnt signaling. Estradiol and DHT are three to four orders of magnitude less potent than estren in these effects. Unlike purported pro-differentiating effects of estradiol, which could be only shown in cells in which the expression of ERalpha was artificially increased by transfection of an ERalpha cDNA, the pro-differentiating effects of estren are demonstrable in bone cells, which express low levels of endogenous ER and AR. Thus, the molecular mechanism of the induction of osteoblast lineage commitment and differentiation by estren will be elucidated by (1) determining the specificity of the ligand/receptor interaction and (2) the involvement of BMP and Wnt signaling in these effects in murine and human osteoblast progenitors and in bone in vivo. A mechanistic explanation will also be sought for why sex steroids, although capable of nongenotropic signaling, differ from estren in their ability to induce lineage commitment and promote osteoblast differentiation, by (3) searching for genotropic counter-regulatory actions on cytokines, kinases, and the BMP and Wnt and signaling pathways. Results of these studies could provide essential understanding for mechanisms to control bone anabolism.","256855",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
I am a National Library of Medicine research postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale University. With this training/research proposal, I am applying to the Career Development Award. I had degreed education in both Biology and Computer Science and started my training and research in Computational Biology, the field of my research interest, in 1998. My immediate career goal is to have an extensive training in functional genomics, both computational and experimental. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator at a research institution and to make a substantial contribution to health-related research field. To achieve these goals, I will first conduct mentored research in functional genomics for two years under the guidance of Profs Gerstein and Snyder at Yale University and then apply for a research position at another institution.   
  
The goal of my proposed research is to obtain and analyze the profiles of gene expression, transcription regulation, and DNA copy number variation related to tumor metastasis progression as the five-year Research Plan: This proposal builds on my experience in genomic analysis of microarray data as a part of the ENCODE Project. For a training grant, the proposed research projects include both experimental and computational components. Specifically, I propose to identify the DNA-binding sites of two key regulators of tumor metastasis (Twist and Snail) in both normal murine embryonic cells and four murine isogenic mammary carcinoma cell lines (67NR, 168FARN, 4T07, and 4T1). In parallel, I will develop new algorithms for analyzing perturbed gene expression profiles to build a regulatory sub-network specific to the EMT process and identify other EMT regulators for further ChlP-chip experiments. As the target genes of the identified EMT regulators could be duplicated or deleted as a result of chromosomal micro-rearrangements during tumor metastasis, I will also carry out computational studies to analyze array-based comparative genomic hybridization data to identify such DNA copy number variations.   
  
I feel the proposed research is quite relevant to public health, becaus cancer is responsible for about 25% of all deaths in the United States. 90% of human cancer deaths, however, can be attributed to metastases, during which tumor cells spread from the primary tumor mass to distant organs. Clearly it is very important to understand what makes metastasis possible for a cancerous tumor and unravel its molecular mechanism.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer enormous potential for regenerative therapies, but occur in low frequency in bone marrow, lack the ability to continuously divide under traditional ex vivo tissue expansion methods and eventually lose their differentiation potential. These factors limit the clinical efficacy of MSC therapies. The most promising approach to extend the expansion potential of MSCs in vitro is the cultivation of cells on extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, where integrin-ligand binding between cells and the ECM are known to activate cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Our objectives are to translate what is known about the role of ECM/MSC interactions in the aging process into a new generation of scaffold designs containing the appropriate chemical signals and physical features capable of regulating stem cell behavior. For this work, silk fibroin proteins will be used as a biomaterial scaffold onto which a variety of signaling molecules will be incorporated. Specific targets include cell adhesion peptides derived from collagen, and factors that activate telomerase to extend telomeres during cell division thus prolonging the life span of the cell. The chemical signaling identity and density of the peptide displays on the 3D silk scaffolds will be optimized independently in order to decouple and isolate the effects on aging of MSCs. In depth chemical and physical characterization of these modified scaffolds, and the morphology, growth rate, differentiation potential, and production of ECM proteins by the MSCs expanded on these modified 3D scaffolds will be studied and quantified along with appropriate controls. Osteogenic markers of MSCs expanded on these scaffolds will be monitored and compared to ascribe changes in cell behavior to the matrix composition. The goal of developing cell culture scaffolds that can delay senescence of MSCs to prolong their proliferative lifetimes would allow for long-term expansion of the cells ex vivo, enabling clinical use of MSCs in a broad range of cell therapies and tissue-engineered devices. Relevance to public health: Adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer enormous potential for bone, cartilage, muscle and ligament regenerative therapies, and are easily obtained from adult bone marrow which avoids the embryonic stem cell controversy. Therefore, this project aims to address some of the clinical limitations of MSCs that currently prevent their use in cell therapies and tissue-engineered devices. Specifically, our goals are to delay the aging process in MSCs cultured ex vivo.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epithelia form physical barriers that separate and protect the internal milieu of the body from its external environment and pathogens. The formation of epithelia requires the coordination of multiple cellular processes that include the assembly of a series of specialized cell-cell junctions responsible for cell to cell adhesion, the establishment of an impermeable barrier, and provide a scaffold for signals to generate epithelial polarity that establish the differential distribution of cell proteins, lipids, and functions to apical and basolateral surfaces. Adhesive junction turnover are required for the movement of epithelia as occurs during normal development and in pathologic conditions such as cancer metastasis. This process has been morphologically and genetically described as an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT has emerged as a central biologic process not only during embryonic development but also in states of chronic inflammation and fibrosis, wound healing, and cancer metastasis in the adult organism. While many different environmental signals induce EMT they all converge to activate nuclear transcription factors that effect an EMT  gene program  through repression of epithelial genes, particularly cell-cell adhesive receptors, and up-regulation of mesenchymal genes. A fundamental question then is to determine whether and how cell surface adhesive events and nuclear processes communicate with one another to coordinate dynamic epithelia biogenesis and morphogenesis. Our laboratory has identified the Ajuba LIM protein family as novel components of Adherens Junctions (AJ) and that are actively recruited to newly forming E-cadherin-dependent junctions. As such they contribute to the formation, stability, and function of junctional complexes. These proteins also translocate to the nucleus, where their function has proved to be more elusive. We have now identified the Ajuba LIM proteins as interacting with the Snail family of transcriptional repressors and act as nuclear co-repressors. Snail family proteins are central regulators of EMT during development and cancer progression. Like Snail, Ajuba LIM proteins were found to be important for the development of neural crest derivatives, in vivo. Thus, Ajuba LIM proteins, analogous to 2-catenin during Wnt signaling, have the potential to coordinate cell surface adhesive events with nuclear responses during epithelia biogenesis/morphogenesis. The general aims of this proposal then are to first determine how the Ajuba LIM protein family influences epithelial cell junction formation, stability, and function and to determine the biologic and functional implications of the nuclear Ajuba LIM protein.  Epithelium cover all body surfaces (outside and inside) and protect us from environmental toxins and pathogens. Therefore understanding how epithelium develop, and how they are maintained is critical to human health and welfare. Moreover how epithelium develops is very similar to how epithelial cancers (e.g., breast, colon, lung) spread, or metastasis, in adults. We have identified a family of proteins that contribute to the formation of epithelium. The goal of this proposal is to understand how this family of protein does so. This knowledge should increase our capacity to treat disorders of the epithelium such as skin disorders, cancer spread, and tissue scaring in response to injury.

resorption, and presenting active TGF(31 to fibroblasts, promoting their conversion to myofibroblasts. AEC
may also exercise their own plasticity to become fibroblast-like in their invasiveness and matrix production.
However, regulation of cellular responses to TGFP1 and the potential of AEC to undergo epithelial to
mesenchymal-like transitions (EMT) in the lung are poorly understood. While TGFP1 signaling is critical to
these processes, TGFbl signaling alone appears insufficient to effect fibrogenesis. Recentfindings show
that epithelial cell EMT responses to TGFbt require b1 integrins and especially the integrin a3b1. These
observations lead to the hypothesis that pi integrins act as a critical sensor in TGFP1 signaling. It isfurther
proposed that in AEC cc3p1, a laminin receptor, is the key regulatory pi integrin which mediates TGFP1
driven epithelial cell plasticity and mesenchymaltransition in the context of lung matrix remodeling. This
hypothesis is addressed in the application through a series of studies which use either RNAi knockdown or
alveolar epithelial cells with inducible deletion of a3(31via ere recombinase to elucidate how integrins
regulate SMAD signaling. The presence of EMT in models of murine fibrogenesis in vivo will be examined
in mice expressing either galactosidase or EGFP selectively in lung epithelial cells and the role of o3p1 in
the process defined by studies of fibrogenesis in mice with conditional deletion of AEC aspl. Elucidation of
a pathway of integrin signaling controlling AEC responsesto TGFP1 and definition of the capacity of AEC to
transition to fibroblasts during matrix remodeling should provide new insight into the pathobiology of
pulmonary fibrosis.","367766",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Isolated cleft lip and palate is a common congenital problem with a complex etiology. The objective of this research is to identify the function of genes critical to palatal formation. Genetic variation in Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6) causes Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) and contributes 12% risk of isolated cleft lip and palate. The pathway containing Irf6 and its cellular role in orchestrating palatal development is not known. Mice deficient for Irf6 have cleft palate, micrognathia and oral adhesions. Mice deficient for either FgflO or Tbx1 have cleft palate and oral adhesions. Mutations in Tbx,1, FgflO, and Fgf8 in humans cause cleft lip and palate. Preliminary data from our laboratory suggests that FgflO expression in the palatal mesenchyme and Fgf8 expression in the palatal epithelium may be downstream targets for Irf6 activation. Furthermore, Irf6 in the craniofacial region may modulate expression of Tbx1 in the palate. Thus, we hypothesize that Irf6 functions in both a cell-autonomous manner to regulate epithelial differentiation and in a non-cell autonomous manner affecting mesenchymal differentiation and these functions are mediated in part through the Fgf signal transduction pathway and Tbx1. We propose to establish the role of Irf6 in palatogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal signaling. We will evaluate apoptosis and proliferation in IrfSA- palatal shelves in-vivo and using in-vitro palatal cultures. Chimeric mice will be used to determine if Irf6 signals in a cell-autonomous fashion. To identify the role of Irf6 in palatal mesenchyme development we will use neural crest and non-neural crest specific ere mouse lines. In Aim 2 we will determine if FgflO is a downstream target of Irf6 signaling during palatal growth. We will evaluate changes in Irf6 and FgflO expression in Irf6 and FgflO null mice and test if there is a direct genetic interaction by creating double Fgf10/lrf6 heterozygous mice. In Aim 3 we will identify the gene(s) responsible for Irf6 signaling from the epithelium to the mesenchyme. We will investigate changes in expression of Tbx1 and Fgf8 in lrf6-\- mice. To test whether there is a direct genetic interaction, we will create double heterozygous Irf6/Tbx1 and Irf6/Fgf8 mice. The goal of this research is to understand the signaling pathway that includes IRF6, and how defects in this pathway lead to cleft lip and palate. We will use this information to examine potential gene-gene interactions in human cleft lip and palate patients.

function of epithelial organs; the ability of the intestinal epithelium to serve as a selective
barrier to antigens and pathogens while absorbing nutrients relies on the presence of
intact cell junctions and distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains. Also, loss
of polarity is an important hallmark of many epithelial cancers and has been correlated
with transformation and uncontrolled growth. Our investigations of intestinal
development and epithelial polarity have focused on the integral membrane protein,
endotubin. Endotubin is found in apical endosomes of polarized epithelial cells. It is
expressed at high levels in developing epithelial organs such as intestine, liver, kidney
and lung, implying a critical role in the development of epithelial structures. Moreover,
we have evidence from in vitro studies that endotubin regulates junctional integrity and
epithelial polarity. In the previous funding period, we discovered that the small GTPase
Rab14 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of endotubin and that mutant forms of
Rab14 compromise targeting to the apical domain. In this proposal, we describe
experiments to elucidate the mechanism of action of endotubin and Rab14 in the
establishment of epithelial cell polarity during development and in the loss of polarity
during transformation. Our hypothesis is that endotubin and Rab14 regulate the
establishment and maintenance of polarity in epithelial cells and that loss of function of
these proteins results in loss of barrier function and/or apical-basolateral polarity,
leading to compromised immunity in the neonate, increased susceptibility to
inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer.
Relevance to human disease: Maintenance of epithelial cell polarity is essential for
intestinal epithelial barrier function, and loss of polarity may predispose these cells to
transformation and uncontrolled growth. Understanding how epithelial cells generate
and maintain their polarized phenotype is critical for our understanding of intestinal
development and pathology.","162216",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Muscular dystrophies show a progressive loss of muscle fibers and ultimate failure to regenerate muscle tissue. Cell-based therapy may restore muscle tissue, and adipose tissue may provide a facile source of cells for such therapy. We have been studying the mechanisms through which BMP or TGF-beta signaling can redirect pre-adipocyte differentiation and found that pre-adipocytes and primary adipose stromal cells can form muscle-like tissue when transplanted into immunodeficient mice. We propose to test the hypothesis that preadipocytes and adipose stromal cells can alter their differentiation to generate functional muscle in vivo, capable of contributing to tissue repair, and that BMP signaling regulates this differentiation. Smads are downstream effectors of signaling by TGF- beta and BMP and serve as cell-intrinsic regulators of mesenchymal differentiation, suggesting that manipulations of the activation levels of individual Smads will profoundly affect the differentiation of preadipocytes into muscle cells. In Aim 1 we will characterize the muscle-like cells generated from 3T3-F442A cells or human adipose stromal cells, and evaluate whether they arise from direct conversion or cell fusion with host myofibers. In Aim 2 we will determine whether transplanted adipogenic cells or adipocytes contribute to muscle repair in dystrophin-deficient nude mice, and determine whether engraftment improves muscle repair. We will also use a genetic approach to evaluate if endogenous (pre)adipocytes can differentiate into myocytes in response to injury and contribute to muscle (re)generation. In Aim 3 and future studies we will examine the role of Smad1 and Smad5, effectors of BMP signaling, and Smad3, effector of TGF-beta and myostatin signaling, as cell-intrinsic regulators of myogenic differentiation. These experiments should show us how to manipulate the myogenic differentiation by modifying Smad signaling. Our studies will hopefully provide the basis for the use of autologous preadipocytes and adipose stromal cells, a readily available cell source, for muscle regeneration and repair. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE.  Patients with muscular dystrophy or defects in muscle repair would benefit from a therapy whereby injected cells would convert into muscle tissue. We recently found that cells that are becoming fat cells can be redirected to become muscle cells. We propose to characterize and to enhance the potential of these cells to become muscle cells, and to explore how they can help in the repair of muscle injury and to counteract the defects associated with muscular dystrophy, using mouse models. This research could provide a basis for the use of one's own fat in therapy to improve muscle repair and regeneration.

Accumulating evidence implicates the corruption of normal, tissue-specific stem cell function or homeostasis in multiple aspects of cancer biology.  Moreover, cancer-associated stem and progenitor cells have been identified in a number of cancers.  However, questions remain regarding the origin of cancer-specific stem cells, their relationship to normal stem cells, and the importance of stem cell microenvironments for modulating malignant transformation.  One hallmark of many tumors is chromosome instability, but the mechanisms of instability, and the relevant cellular targets, remain mostly unidentified.  We have previously shown that the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway of DNA double-strand break repair suppresses tumorigenesis in numerous tissues of either hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) or bone marrow stromal/mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) origin.  In this context, we hypothesize that the NHEJ pathway is critical for the fitness and function of normal HSC and MSC, preventing their malignant transformation. Using a mouse model of NHEJ deficiency, prone to pro-B lymphomagenesis, we have made significant progress in testing these hypotheses.  We have now obtained data indicating that NHEJ-deficient bone marrow stromal cells (the hematopoietic stem cell microenvironment) exhibit a higher mitotic index and overall greater stress resistance than their wild-type counterparts.  This surprising finding may explain the predisposition of Art-null (Trp53 heterozygous) mice to develop apparently MSC-derived anaplastic sarcomas. Moreover, these data may point to critical interactions between NHEJ-defective lymphoid progenitors and their bone marrow stromal microenvironment, that may be relevant to lymphoma initiation.  Next, we will assess whether NHEJ-deficient MSCs exhibit chromosomal instability or modulate pro-B cell lymphomagenesis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term goal of this program is to develop nanoarrays as highly-specific, highly-sensitive and ultrahigh-throughput platforms in mass spectrometry for proteomic and metabolomic applications. This will be built upon the close collaborations of 2 laboratories with complementary expertise: Wang (LBNL) in mass spectrometry and proteomics, and Yang (LBNL/UC Berkeley) in nanoscience and nanotechnology. Proteomics and metabolomics as integral systems biology components will generate a new knowledgebase for hypothesis-driven biochemical and bioimaging studies. Further developments in the enabling technology- mass spectrometry-are required to significantly increase the sensitivity and dynamic range. Revolutionary innovations are needed to ultimately achieve proteomics and metabolomics of single cells. Nanostructures are structures defined as having at least 1 dimension at nanometer scale, and have generated intensive interests as a result of their fascinating properties, and unique applications superior to their bulk counterparts. Exciting opportunities exist by making new types of nanostructures or simply by shrinking the size of existing microstructures into the nanometer regime. In this exploratory/ developmental R21 project, we propose to develop novel nanoarray-based substrates for mass spectrometry and demonstrate their applications in proteomics and metabolomics. Specifically we propose to develop a new kind of ionization source. We will take a multi-faceted approach to fabricate and characterize the devices (Aim 1), elucidate the ionization mechanisms (Aim 2), and demonstrate the proof-of-principle applications in mass spectrometry for single stem cell proteomics (Aim 3). Our extensive capabilities and expertise in the fabrication of nanowire and nanotube arrays, and in the integration of nanodevices and microdevices, will put us in a unique position to achieve potential breakthroughs. If successful, these nano devices will serve as a critical component in the nanofluidics and microfluidics structures to separate, detect, and identify biomolecules, and open up new possibilities in systems biology. Relevance to public health: Stem cells can self-renew and show great promise in regenerative medicine. Revolutionary innovations are needed to ultimately elucidate stem cell differentiation at single cell level. Towards this goal, we propose to utilize the enormous potential of nanotechnology to develop novel ionization substrates for mass spectrometry to study proteins and metabolites of single stem cells.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in the dental biomaterials field, metal implant corrosion remains a pertinent clinical issue. Implanted metals are subject to wear and corrosion due to mechanical and environmental factors. This degradative process releases metal ions, which stimulate fibrous tissue formation, leading to impairment of osseointegration and implant failure. Titanium and titanium alloy, metals used for dental applications, release ions which localize to tissues surrounding implants. Although it is well established that metal ions impair osteogenesis, the molecular mechanisms by which metal ions direct tissue differentiation have yet to be identified. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-¿) is a key factor driving fibrotic responses and impedes osteoblast differentiation. Thus, we hypothesize that TGF-?¿ is an important mediator for the effects of metal ions on tissue differentiation at the tissue-implant interface. TGF-?¿ must be activated from its biologically latent form to induce fibrogenesis. Activation of latent TGF-(3 occurs by multiple mechanisms, including oxidative modification of the latent complex and binding to thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), a matricellular glycoprotein present in wounds and in fibrous tissue. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent, home to sites of tissue injury, and play a role in both normal and fibrotic repair responses. Although MSCs have been studied extensively in other disease processes, the role of stem cells and the mechanisms regulating repair and fibrosis in response to implant metals are poorly understood. In preliminary studies, we tested the hypothesis that TSP1-dependent TGF-?¿ activation is important for fibrotic responses to titanium and stainless steel ions. Cocktails of metal ions were used to mimic the composition of titanium, titanium alloy and stainless steel corrosion products in vitro. MSCs treated with metal ions showed increased levels of TGF-?¿ activity and expression of myofibroblast markers, partially due to TSP1-dependent TGF-?¿ activation, and inhibition of osteogenesis. These studies support the hypothesis that titanium and titanium alloy corrosion products alter tissue integration of metal implants by stimulating TGF-?¿ -dependent myofibroblastic differentiation of stem cells, leading to fibrous tissue formation surrounding the implant. This study will specifically determine the mechanisms by which metal corrosion products induce the myofibroblast phenotype by assessing the involvement of TSP1 and oxidative mechanisms of TGF-?¿ activation in both in vitro and in vivo systems. The goal of this study is to improve implant biocompatibility with host tissue by elucidating the role of mesenchymal stem cells in TGF-?¿ dependent fibrous tissue formation.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a competing renewal of a project focused on understanding the role of the cadherin/catenin complex in modulating cellular behavior that is relevant to tumorigenesis. In this grant period, we will expand our investigations into the mechanisms whereby cadherin complexes influence cell behavior by exploring crosstalk between cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, since both types of adhesion are critical to cellular processes like migration and invasion. In particular, our studies will focus on how one member of the cadherin/catenin complex, Alpha-catenin, coordinates cell-cell adhesion with activity of invadopodia, a cell substrate adhesive structure that mediates invasion in tumor cells. Our overall hypothesis is that alpha-catenin plays a central role in coordinating cellular signals that regulate cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion through its interactions with actin cytoskeletal components and signaling pathways. This hypothesis stems from strong preliminary evidence generated using an alpha-catenin-null human breast cancer cell line that undergoes remodeling of invadopodia in response to alpha-catenin re- expression. Our specific aims are: 1) to determine if alpha-catenin interacts directly with components of invadopodia; 2) to test the hypotheses that VASP function is important for maintenance of invadopodia and that expression of beta-catenin modulates VASP function; and 3) to define the role of alpha-catenin in regulating ERK signaling. Tumor formation and invasion are significant human health problems. The proposed research focuses on understanding how a cell coordinates changes in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions as it becomes malignant. A basic understanding of tumor cell biology and the mechanisms involved in tumorigenesis will provide a basis for developing new methods for diagnosis and treatment. Studies proposed here will increase our understanding of cancer biology by identifying pathways involved in the cross talk between cell- cell and cell-matrix interactions and by characterizing signaling roles for beta-catenin, which is an understudied component of cellular junctions.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fibrotic lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, represent a heterogeneous group of diseases in which progressive parenchymal fibrosis disrupts the structure and gas exchanging functions of the lungs. In the microenvironment of the distal lung, this pathobiology is characterized by an increased population of fibroblasts and augmented collagen and matrix synthesis. In addition to fibroblasts, recent evidence points to a critical role for lung epithelial cells in determining the extent and progression of lung fibrosis. The importance of epithelial cells in fibrogenesis is highlighted by the identification of mutations in the epithelial-restricted gene encoding surfactant protein C (SP-C), that are associated with familial pulmonary fibrosis. While a variety of pathways have been implicated in cross-talk between epithelium and fibroblasts, the critical mechanisms by which epithelial cells influence the effector fibroblast population are not well established. We hypothesize that interactions between lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts determine the severity and progression of lung fibrosis. Specifically, we propose that: 1) epithelial cells, predominantly alveolar type II epithelium, contribute to fibrosis by undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vivo, 2) epithelial cells regulate proliferation and survival of resident fibroblasts, and 3) phenotypic changes in alveolar type II epithelial cells that cause endoplasmic reticulum stress lead to lung fibrosis by impairing re-epithelialization and inducing an increased population of effector fibroblasts following injury. Three specific aims are proposed to investigate this hypothesis: 1) to define the extent of epithelial-mesenchymal transition as a source of fibroblasts in experimental pulmonary fibrosis, 2) to determine the pro-fibrotic effects of mutant SP-C expression in alveolar type II epithelial cells, and 3) to investigate the effects of epithelial dysfunction induced by expression of mutant SP-C on fibroblast recruitment/activation and development of lung fibrosis. These studies will use transgenic mice and cell culture systems to define essential roles for epithelial cells in the generation of lung fibrosis. Identifying the impact of alveolar type II epithelial cell phenotype on induction and maintenance of specific populations of effector fibroblasts will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis and identify new treatment approaches. Relevance to public health: Progressive fibrotic lung diseases frequently lead to respiratory failure and death. These studies will provide a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of disease pathogenesis and suggest new treatment approaches for these devastating diseases.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our laboratory has had a long standing interest in identifying the molecules and understanding the mechanisms that regulate tumor growth.  We have recently identified the presence of NGAL (Neutrophil Gelatinase- Associated Lipocalin) both alone, and complexed to the gelatinase MMP-9, in the urine of women with breast cancer.  NGAL is a member of the lipocalin family of proteins, a group of small, secreted proteins that can transport and present ligands, bind to cell-surface receptors, and form macromolecular complexes.  The presence of NGAL has been correlated with breast cancer development and progression and its potential as a biomarker of human breast cancer has been suggested.  We have recently demonstrated that the overexpression of NGAL in human breast cancer cells induces an EMT (Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transformation), a hallmark of cancer progression.  We have found that NGAL induces the down-regulation of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin, along with a concomitant upregulation of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin as well as inducing the development or a scattering phenotype consistent with the loss of E-cadherin- mediated cell-cell adhesion.  We have also determined that the expression level of the transcription factor Slug, known to induce EMT, is increased in NGAL-expressing cells.  In addition, the expression of the estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) was significantly downregulated by NGAL over-expression.  Finally, we have demonstrated that NGAL overexpression leads to significantly increased human breast cancer cell motility and invasivity.  Taken together, these data demonstrate that NGAL can induce EMT and may regulate breast cancer aggressiveness.  Within the context of the Specific Aims of our proposal, we will determine the mechanism(s) by which NGAL induces EMT in breast cancer cells.  These mechanistic studies will be complemented by a series of in vivo ones in which we will determine the effects of NGAL on human breast cancer progression in vivo using three complementary in vivo models.  These studies will also evaluate the potential role of NGAL as a therapeutic target in the treatment of breast cancer.  In the third aim of this study, we will determine whether NGAL, alone or in combination with other cancer biomarkers, may be a diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker for breast cancer.  These studies are proposed within the context of the following Specific Aims: 1. To determine the mechanism(s) by which NGAL induces an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells; 2. To determine whether NGAL can promote human breast cancer progression in vivo; 3. To determine whether the presence of NGAL, alone or multiplexed with other urinary cancer biomarkers, predicts tumor presence and therapeutic efficacy in animal models of breast cancer and in human patients with breast cancer.  By systematically identifying novel molecules that may be playing a role in the development of aggressive breast cancer, and by dissecting the mechanisms by which such molecules may be exerting their effects, we will have the opportunity to develop new and improved therapeutic, diagnostic and prognostic strategies that could result in significantly improved breast cancer patient survival.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant: The broad objectives of this study are to identify the optimal adult-derived tissue source (bone marrow, muscle, or adipose tissue) for isolation of mesenchymal progenitor cells capable of differentiating into cartilage or bone. Successful completion of the studies outlined in this proposal will provide a strong foundation for our long term goal of refining present strategies for improved clinical outcome of stem cell enhanced restoration of bone or cartilage.  
The hypothesis of this proposal is that a progenitor cell subpopulation with a capacity to preferentially differentiate into cartilage or bone can be identified and isolated from other cell subpopulations derived from bone marrow aspirate, muscle, or adipose tissue. As a first step towards reaching our long-term objective we will define unique features of subpopulations of mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC)s derived from adult-derived bone marrow aspirate, muscle, and adipose tissues. We will then quantify the number of stem cells that can be obtained from each tissue, and finally, we will determine which tissue(s) provides the optimal MPC source for differentiation into cartilage or bone. To achieve these goals, will use single cell cloning, gene expression levels with quantitative RT PCR, flow cytometric analyses of several cell surface protein markers, and immunohistochemical techniques. Expanding our knowledge of MPC subpopulations is an important step toward understanding stem cell physiology and is essential for critical assessment of MPC-based grafting procedures.  
The expectation is that completion of the studies outlined in this proposal will provide important insight into the identification and isolation of MPC subpopulations. A more precise understanding of the heterogenous population of MPC obtained from adult tissues should improve differentiation of MPCs into cartilage and bone. We anticipate that these findings will have a major impact on the clinical use of MPCs in targeted tissue repair applications.  
The research in this proposal is important for improving the health of millions afflicted with arthritis or bone diseases. Our studies will expand the present knowledge base concerning adult tissue-derived stem cell biology with a specific focus on the clinical application of stem cells for repair of joints and bones.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this proposal is to unveil the pleiotropic activity of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 during breast cancer progression.  Emerging clinical evidence indicates that TIMP-1 is a potent predictor of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients.  However, the mechanisms of action of TIMP-1 in breast epithelial cells are not completely understood.  In addition to its classical activity as an inhibitor of metalloproteinase (MP) activity, accumulating evidence indicates that TIMP-1 can also promote cell survival independently of MP inhibition.  During the past funding period, we conclusively showed that TIMP-1 is a potent inhibitor of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis independent of its MP inhibitory activity.  Importantly, our recent study identified the tetraspanin member CD63 as the first TIMP-1 binding cell surface protein which modulates the integrin ¿1 survival pathway.  TIMP-1 activation of the CD63/integrin signaling complex implies potentially diverse effects of TIMP-1 on many cellular processes.  Preliminary data show that TIMP-1 also inhibits lumen formation and apoptosis during morphogenesis of non-malignant breast epithelial MCF10A acini in three-dimensional matrigel cultures.  Moreover, TIMP-1 interaction with CD63 induces an epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) via upregulation of the EMT master transcription factor Twist, known to promote cancer progression.  Structurally, TIMP-1 binds to CD63 via its non-MP inhibitory C-terminal domain as it does to latent pro-MMP-9.  This suggests a novel mechanism of TIMP-1 regulation at the cell surface, in which the availability of pro-MMP-9 in the pericellular space may regulate TIMP-1/CD63 interactions.  Based on our previous and preliminary studies, we hypothesize that TIMP-1/CD63 activation of integrin ¿1/a signaling complex activates focal adhesion (FAK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) leading to cell survival, increased Twist expression and EMT during the early stages of tumor progression and metastasis.  To test our hypothesis, we propose (1) to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which TIMP-1 and CD63 regulate integrin heterodimer functions, (2) to investigate TIMP-1/CD63-mediated intracellular signal transduction pathways for the regulation of cell survival and EMT, (3) to establish the role of pro-MMP-9 in the regulation of TIMP-1/CD63-mediated cell survival, and (4) to examine the in vivo roles of TIMP-1 during breast cancer progression.  Accomplishment of the proposed studies will contribute to the collective endeavor to understand the multi functions of TIMP-1 during breast cancer progression.  This information may also be useful for the development of novel approaches for targeting TIMP-1's signaling activity versus its MP inhibitory activity.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, a natural inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MPs), has been shown to inhibit tumor cell invasion in vitro and tumor progression in animal models of later stages of tumor metastasis.  However, emerging clinical evidence indicates that TIMP-1 is a potent predictor of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, an unexpected observation in light of these previously reported studies.  Accumulating evidence provided by many investigators including us indicates that TIMP-1 can also promote cell survival independently of its MP inhibition.  Interestingly, the preliminary data show that TIMP-1 also induces epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in breast epithelial cells.  The goals of the current application are to unveil molecular mechanisms by which TIMP-1 regulates cell survival and EMT, and to examine its potential oncogenic activity in an animal model of the early stages of breast cancer progression.  Accomplishment of the proposed studies will contribute to the collective endeavor to understand the multiple functions of TIMP-1 during breast cancer progression.  This information may also be useful for the development of novel approaches for targeting TIMP-1's signaling activity versus its MP inhibitory activity.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The significance of gap junction mediated communication to human health is increasingly evident from the human diseases caused by expression of defective gap junction proteins (connexins Cx), including: peripheral neuropathies, cardiac developmental malformations, deafness, cataracts and skin diseases. The diverse phenotypes in mice arising from Cx gene ablation and substitution lend further support to the importance of gap junctions to development and function of the cardiovascular system, in particular, and to the animal in general. The primary function of gap junctions is to mediate the intercellular exchange of the signaling molecules that result in coordinated tissue function in health and disease. The selectivity of this exchange pathway is apparently Cx specific and acutely regulated. The long-term goal of the current proposal is to identify the functional consequences of sequential and simultaneous expression of Cx40 and Cx43. In particular, the selectivity of the junctions formed by Cx43, Cx40 and both connexins, and the mechanisms and structural basis for regulation of junctional selectivity by phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms will be examined. In Aim 1 the consequences of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on the selectivity of Cx43 or Cx40 comprised channels and junctions are explored. Selectivity will be quantified using state-of-the-art electrophysiology, fluorescence microscopy and mathematical modeling techniques. In Aim 2 the structural bases for the responses delineated in Aim 1 are determined. The amino acid residues targeted by specific kinases in each Cx are identified by the powerful combination of electrospray ionization (ES), which allows for rapid and sensitive analyses of proteins and peptides, coupled to an HPLC (LC), which allows for on-line separation of peptide mixtures, followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The functional significance of identified phosphorylation sites in each Cx will be explored using site-directed mutants of those sites. In Aim 3 the consequences of mixed channel formation on junctional selectivity, the regulation thereof by phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms, and the structural bases for observed regulation are examined. The results of the proposed studies should provide new insights on the functional consequences of differential Cx expression, which is essential information for understanding the structural basis for gap junction channel selectivity and regulation thereof, and necessary data for the development of testable hypotheses regarding the rules of Cx interaction and their potential consequences in the in vivo setting.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Testosterone (T) supplementation increases muscle mass and decreases fat mass in a variety of clinical trials using healthy young men, hypogonadal men, and in older men with low serum T levels. However, the molecular mechanisms by which T regulates body composition are not well known. We identified that T increases muscle mass and decreases fat mass in mesenchymal multipotent cells via androgen receptor (AR)-mediated pathway and activates AR/beta-catenin/TCF-4 pathway in preadipocyte cells to inhibit adipogenesis that was associated with up-regulation of follistatin (Fst). We hypothesize that T activates AR/beta-catenin/TCF-4 pathway both in vitro and in vivo to activate Fst, which regulates body composition by inhibiting Mst/TGF-beta signaling. We will employ two validated in vitro models of adult, mesenchymal stem cells to test whether T and DHT activate Fst via activation of AR/beta-catenin/TCF-4 pathway to regulate cell differention, and inhibition of beta-catenin by SiRNA abolishes these effects. We will determine the interaction between AR, beta-catenin, and TCF-4 by immunoprecipitation and their nuclear translocation by immunofluorescence and cell fractionation. TCF-4 transcriptional activation in response to androgen will be measured by using TCF-4 luciferase reporter assay. We will determine whether these androgens inhibit TGF-beta/Mst signaling in vitro through up-regulation of Fst. We will test whether T and DHT inhibit Mst bioactivity, Smad2/3 phosphorylation and activate Smad7 in vitro and inhibition of Fst levels either by Fst SiRNA or use of anti-Fst antibody blocks the effects of these androgens on myogenic differentiation. We will investigate whether castration-induced effects on body composition in C57/BL6J mice are accompanied by parallel decrease in Fst levels and supplementation of T or recombinant follistatin in these castrated mice significantly block castration-induced effects on fat-free mass and overall body composition. These studies will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of androgen action and have direct relevance to the application of either Fst alone or in combination of low doses of T for the treatment of HIV and aging-associated muscle loss as high supraphysiological doses of T are associated with its pleotropic effects including increased risk of prostate cancer by elevating prostate-specific antigen.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a multi-investigator, collaborative proposal based on the concept that respiratory epithelial stem/progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation are controlled, at least in part, by transcriptional mechanisms that determine gene expression, cell fates, and functions. Cellular replacement for therapy of severe pulmonary disorders will require detailed knowledge of the transcriptional programs that govern respiratory epithelial specification and differentiation. The long-term goals of this application are to 1) identify respiratory epithelial progenitor cells (REPCs) and the transcriptional programs mediating their proliferation and differentiation, and 2) assess the ability of these transcriptional mediators to engineer/program both endogenous respiratory epithelial progenitor cells and exogenous cells (including embryonic stem cells (ES) and multipotent stem cell progenitors (MSC/Ps), to exhibit respiratory epithelial differentiation that may be useful for cell replacement for life-threatening pulmonary disease. We will use mouse cells and transgenic mouse models to identify REPCs and the transcriptional programs regulating their proliferation and differentiation, seeking to identify subsets of conducting and peripheral airway cells that exhibit stem cell/progenitor cell behavior during lung regeneration/repair. Transcriptional engineering will be used to determine the scope of cellular plasticity and proliferation of REPCs, MSC/Ps, and ES cells. The ability of non-pulmonary cells to be transcriptionally engineered to express respiratory epithelial cell selective genes and functions will be determined. The experiments are designed to test the ability of both endogenous and exogenous REPCs to engraft in the lung and to contribute to repair of the respiratory epithelium. Clinically relevant mouse models will be utilized to assess this potential, with particular focus to post-pneumonectomy lung regeneration and repair after respiratory epithelial cell specific cell ablation and Sftpc-/- mice, the latter developing severe interstitial lung disease that is similar to that seen in individuals inheriting mutations in SFTPC, a gene causing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in patients. A Stem Cell Consortium will be established at CCHMC, Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine to develop education, training, and research bridging hematopoietic stem cell and pulmonary stem cell biology on our campus.","18000",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteogenesis Imperfecta (Ol) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the type I collagen genes COL1A1 or COL1A2 that can result in major skeletal abnormalities, fractures, and premature death. Severe forms of Ol are typically caused by dominant mutations that disrupt the collagen triple helix, so an effective treatment will require the elimination of dominant, mutant alleles. The long-term objective of this proposal is to develop a novel approach for the treatment of Ol based on the transplantation of genetically modified autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that produce bone-forming osteoblasts in vivo. These MSCs will be genetically modified by vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) that can efficiently target homologous, chromosomal genes and thereby disrupt mutant collagen genes. In Ol MSCs with mutations in COL1A1, an AAV gene targeting vector disrupted the COL1A1 gene in up to 90% of selected MSCs, which then produced normal collagen and formed bone, in the only published example to date of successful gene targeting in adult human stem cells.   
    Here these findings will be extended by targeting the COL1A2 gene in Ol MSCs with novel AAV vectors that do not encode foreign antigens, and demonstrating that these targeted cells form normal collagen and bone. Targeting frequencies will be determined in MSCs from multiple individuals to evaluate the effects of genetic variation on gene targeting and recombination. Transplantation methods for gene-targeted MSCs will be studied in a rabbit model to optimize long-term MSC engraftment rates and determine safety. These experiments are intended to develop an AAV targeting vector and MSC transplantation protocol that would be appropriate for clinical trials of Ol.   
    These experiments are significant because they will develop a new and promising approach for the treatment of Ol. The research will also have broader implications, since gene targeting methods for human MSCs could potentially be applied to many diseases of bone, cartilage, muscle, and possibly other tissues.

Medicare population. A majority of patients with HF have poor left ventricular function, with 60-70% due to
chronic ischemic coronary disease. The remainder of patients experience HF due to a variety of other
causes, including idiopathic and viral cardiomyopathies, and are classified as dilated non-ischemic
cardiomyopathies.
Stem cells (endothelial, mesenchymal, skeletal or from bone marrow), injected directly into the myocardium
or delivered to the coronary circulation, can improve cardiac function in chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy or
following an acute myocardial infarction. While there is evidence that cell therapy can improve cardiac
function, the exact mechanisms through which cell therapy exerts beneficial effects remain unclear. We and
others have demonstrated that the cardioprotective effects of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) following
myocardial infarction are mediated, in part, by multiple cytokines secreted by stem cells, which can favorably
enhance myocardial survival. We postulate that an enriched, mixed, stem cell population may offer an
advantage over a single cell type. It is also evident from our studies that active interaction between stem
cells and the vascular wall during systemic delivery is necessary for efficient grafting to occur.
This proposal describes two clinical protocols to use bone marrow-derived cells for the treatment of left
ventricular dysfunction. The first will test the hypothesis that expansion of bone marrow cells to yield high
levels of endothelial and mesenchymal progenitor cells will produce a greater improvement in cardiac
function compared to freshly harvested bone marrow cells. The second will investigate the role of cell
therapy in dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and test the hypothesis that adenosine pretreatment will
enhance cell homing potentiating the beneficial effects of cell therapy. To foster future research, a Clinical
Research Skills Development Core will train new clinical investigators in cardiac cell-therapy.
The two clinical protocols will determine the efficacy of different cell preparations and the role of modulating
stem cell engraftment in target tissue to restore ventricular function opening the way for feasible, easily
applied strategies to capture the healing properties of bone marrow-derived cells.","527149",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Susan Volk has previous basic science training in an NIH-sponsored VMD-PhD program and subsequently completed subspecialty clinical training as a veterinary surgeon. This proposal involves a new research direction for her, focusing on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) based therapy for chronic cutaneous wounds and the molecular mechanisms of wound healing. The mentor, Dr. Alan Flake, will contribute expertise in the field of stem cell therapies and guide the candidate in developing an independent research program. Additional contributors will provide expertise in the fields of wound healing, dermatopathology and extracellular matrix biology. The academic component will include seminars, training in research ethics, and graduate-level courses. The candidate's limited clinical activities as a small animal soft tissue surgeon will complement her basic science investigation. Research will focus on establishing vulnerary efficacy of topically applied MSC to treat ischemic wounds and dissecting mechanisms of their therapeutic effects. Ischemic wounds create a formidable clinical challenge, with prolonged hospitalization and substantial healthcare expenditure. To date, effective therapies for ischemic ulcers and other chronic nonhealing wounds are lacking. Evidence in this proposal suggests that bone marrow derived MSC improve healing of ischemic wounds. The hypothesis to be tested is that MSC improve ischemic wound healing by both direct and indirect mechanisms. Aim1 will evaluate the capacity of MSC to significantly improve the rate at which ischemic wounds heal by promoting contraction, epithelialization and granulation tissue formation. This will be accomplished using two models of ischemic wound healing: an established rabbit ear model and a murine model that will be characterized. Aim 2 will test the hypotheses that MSC contribute directly to the wound healing as a myofibroblast and indirectly by producing paracrine factors that promote angiogenesis and epithelialization. It is anticipated that these studies may lead to tissue engineering approaches for treating ischemic wounds; using ex vivo expanded MSC and also provide substantial new insights into molecular mechanisms that are critical for healing ischemic tissues. This combination of training and research will allow the candidate to transition to a fully independent research investigator making contributions to the field of soft-tissue repair, while also retaining ties to the clinical veterinary community.

Musculoskeletal tissues are typically heterogeneous, where notable patterns of cell phenotype and matrix architecture are appear to optimally support spatial gradients in mechanical loading: chondrocytes, type II collagen, and proteoglycan in regions of high pressure; fibroblasts and type I collagen in regions of high distortion. Matching patterns present in mature tissues may be critical for successful musculoskeletal tissue engineering. Our long-term goal is to develop a bioreactor system in which complex fibrocartilaginous tissues can be matured in vitro. Rather than designing appropriate heterogeneity via engineered scaffolds that are subsequently seeded with cells, our approach is to begin with a uniform population of pluripotent cells and direct their differentiation and matrix production in vitro using loading patterns that mimic in situ conditions. An advantage of this approach is that the bioengineered implants will be conditioned and adapted to those mechanical stresses they will be exposed to after implantation. For this strategy to be successful, we must first characterize the mechanoplasticity (responsiveness to mechanical stimulation) of pluripotent cells as a function of their differentiation stage, and then develop predictive mathematical models. To achieve this, we propose three specific aims. First we will characterize the time-dependent differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in 3-dimensional gels under appropriate biologic mediators. Next, we propose to determine at which differentiation stage mesenchymal stem cells respond maximally to either tensile strain or hydrostatic stress and define and validate a mathematical criterion relating matrix loading to cell function. Finally, we will utilize finite element simulations along with the mathematical criterion to define a loading regimen that produces a spatial distribution of matrix deformation (indentation) to pattern cell phenotype and matrix composition. This loading regimen will be applied to gels with mesenchymal stem cells to demonstrate whether spatial heterogeneity of mechanical stimulation can be used to drive spatial heterogeneity in cell phenotype and matrix content in vitro. We anticipate that the results of this research will not only lead to improved tissue engineering methodologies but also provide insight into mechanobiologic processes that guide tissue remodeling and repair.","245823",

There has been a great deal of excitement in the last few years over the potential therapeutic use of isolated stem cells to repair or regenerate diseased organs. Bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are currently being evaluated as a source of immature endothelial cells or angioblasts that can repair damaged vasculature. Hypoxia, or reduced oxygen tension, favors the differentiation of MSCs into cells capable of building new blood vessels. However, the classical hypoxia-induced angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) are not fully capable of restoring this effect. The hypoxia-regulated factor, erythropoietin (Epo), is known to mediate differentiation of erythroblasts into mature red blood cells. More recently, Epo was reported to in_luce a pro-angiogenic phenotype in human endothelial cells. In cancer biology, Epo secretion has been implicated in tumor growth and angiogenesis of erythrocytic leukemia cells, hepatocellular carcinoma and several female breast and reproductive organ carcinomas. Tumor angiogenesis is critical for tumor growth and survival. The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that local erythropoietin secretion following tissue exposure to hypoxia initiates a cascade of events in erythropoietin receptor bearing MSCs and endothelial cells that leads to their differentiation and contribution to new blood vessel formation facilitating malignant tumor development. To test this hypothesis the following aims are proposed: Aim 1 Evaluate the effects of environmental cues given by Epo and/or hypoxia on the induction of a pro-angiogenic phenotype of treated MSC and endothelial cells and; Aim 2 Determine the cellular responses of Epo and/or hypoxia -treated MSC and endothelial cells. Aim 3 Establish an animal model of Kaposi''s Sarcoma as a tool to characterize in vivo the pro-angiogenic potential of mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial cells and their contribution towards tumor angiogenesis. Defining these Epo-mediated events may lead to a better understanding of hypoxia driven angiogenic processes and the identification of novel targets for the design of improved cancer therapy. Apart from defining a new mechanism for tumor cell recruitment of blood vessels, successful completion of the proposed studies will contribute to our basic understanding of stem cells and how they might be valuable in gene therapy. Importantly, the information gained from this study may implicate Epo and EpoR signaling mechanisms as regulating angiogenesis and may particularly elucidate regulatory pathways controlling the cellular fate ofmesench,ymal stem cells."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this project is to create new bone graft materials based on the directed differentiation of adult human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) in defined three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments, which can be delivered as a paste directly to the site of bone repair. hMSC are a promising autogenous cell source for bone tissue engineering because of their demonstrated ability to proliferate, as well as to clearly differentiate into the osteogenic lineage. A main factor limiting their use in bone repair is the inability to reliably control the induction and maintenance of osteogenic differentiation. This project directly addresses this issue by carefully controlling the extracellular environment immediately surrounding hMSC, by embedding them in protein hydrogel beads (20-200 um in diameter) of defined extracellular matrix (ECM) and growth factor composition. The central hypothesis is that hMSC differentiation can be directed through structural and compositional changes in the cellular microenvironment. The combination of specific integrin binding to natural ECM proteins and highly efficient, local delivery of growth factors in a 3D microenvironment is expected to provide a potent stimulus for osteogenic differentiation of hMSC. The Specific Aims of this project are to: 1] identify 3D extracellular microenvironment formulations that consistently promote differentiation of hMSC towards the osteogenic phenotype, 2] augment the extracellular microenvironment with BMP-2, a growth factor known to have potent osteoinductive effects, 3] adapt the use of defined cellular microenvironments to high density culture, and test them as an injectable cell delivery system in vitro, and 4] test 3D matrix-embedded hMSC in vivo in a segmental defect model in immunodeficient rats. The approach of creating defined 3D bead microenvironments addresses four key elements that are critical to effective bone repair: i] the presence of living osteogenic cells (hMSC), ii] an osteoinductive scaffold (the natural ECM proteins collagen I and vitronectin), iii] osteoinductive growth factors to provide signals to the resident cells (BMP-2), and iv] an adequate blood supply to support cell growth and function (by providing void spaces between beads for vascular ingrowth and VEGF delivery in vivo). This project is aimed at clinical problems that can benefit from therapies that accelerate bone healing in a difficult environment, such as avascular necrosis, spinal fusion and implant fixation. It will yield fundamental knowledge of how hMSC phenotype can be controlled by the 3D extracellular environment, and will therefore have broad impact on regenerative medicine. In the field of orthopaedic tissue engineering, it will yield a new cell-based bone repair therapy.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a multi-investigator, collaborative proposal based on the concept that respiratory epithelial stem/progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation are controlled, at least in part, by transcriptional mechanisms that determine gene expression, cell fates, and functions. Cellular replacement for therapy of severe pulmonary disorders will require detailed knowledge of the transcriptional programs that govern respiratory epithelial specification and differentiation. The long-term goals of this application are to 1) identify respiratory epithelial progenitor cells (REPCs) and the transcriptional programs mediating their proliferation and differentiation, and 2) assess the ability of these transcriptional mediators to engineer/program both endogenous respiratory epithelial progenitor cells and exogenous cells (including embryonic stem cells (ES) and multipotent stem cell progenitors (MSC/Ps), to exhibit respiratory epithelial differentiation that may be useful for cell replacement for life-threatening pulmonary disease. We will use mouse cells and transgenic mouse models to identify REPCs and the transcriptional programs regulating their proliferation and differentiation, seeking to identify subsets of conducting and peripheral airway cells that exhibit stem cell/progenitor cell behavior during lung regeneration/repair. Transcriptional engineering will be used to determine the scope of cellular plasticity and proliferation of REPCs, MSC/Ps, and ES cells. The ability of non-pulmonary cells to be transcriptionally engineered to express respiratory epithelial cell selective genes and functions will be determined. The experiments are designed to test the ability of both endogenous and exogenous REPCs to engraft in the lung and to contribute to repair of the respiratory epithelium. Clinically relevant mouse models will be utilized to assess this potential, with particular focus to post-pneumonectomy lung regeneration and repair after respiratory epithelial cell specific cell ablation and Sftpc-/- mice, the latter developing severe interstitial lung disease that is similar to that seen in individuals inheriting mutations in SFTPC, a gene causing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in patients. A Stem Cell Consortium will be established at CCHMC, Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine to develop education, training, and research bridging hematopoietic stem cell and pulmonary stem cell biology on our campus.","498219",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  High dose chemoradiotherapy is used to treat patients with malignancies undergoing BMT. The most common regimen remains high dose Cytoxan (Cy) and total body irradiation (TBI) which has lung i injury (termed idiopathic pneumonia syndrome: IPS) as a major complication. Mortality is at least 75%.We have established murine models using Cy/TBI and alIoBMT. Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells are responsible for surfactant secretion and fluid and solute clearance. Our central hypothesis is that strategies that preserve, speed regeneration of, or replace AT2 cells will have a major impact on lung repair post-BMT. Cytokines have been shown to regulate the development and proliferation of epithelial cells. Fibroblast growth factor-7 (fgf-7), also known as keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), binds to its receptor, FgfR2-111b, expressed on AT2 cells. Fgf-7 protects AT2 cells from injury induced. Based on the model that AT2 are targets for IPS injury, we hypothesized that fgf-7 pretreatment would prevent AT2 damage or hasten AT2 cell repair after BMT, reducing IPS injury. Our data indicate fgf-7 effects are associated with a reduced frequency of injured AT2 cells. In aim 1, we will determine the efficacy of and mechanism(s) responsible for the effects of fgf-7 on preventing or treating IPS, focusing upon AT2 cells. In aim 2, we will determine whether cellular therapies can be used to prevent or treat IPS injury. We hypothesize that marrow stromal cells (MSCs), also known as mesenchymal stem cells, or multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) or AT2 cells differentiated from these progenitor cells will result in alveolar re-epithelialization when used alone or along with fgf-7. Since both MSCs and MAPCs have been shown to have the capacity to differentiate into pulmonary epithelial cells, the peri-BMT administration of undifferentiated or AT2 differentiated MSCs and MAPCs offer promise for aiding in lung repair post-BMT. These translatable approaches offer new avenues for the prevention and treatment of IPS.","354382",

The hypothesis of this proposal is that aging compromises stem cell quality as a result of progressive differentiation of the more primitive stem cells of the hierarchy over time. Compromised stem cell quality negatively affects the repair of tissue damage or stress as well as the regenerative response to chronic diseases which would lead to a decline in general health status. To test the hypothesis, Aim #1 will characterize hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cell compartment quality in the bone marrows of a wide age range of surgical orthopedic patients. The ratios of the more differentiated to more primitive stem/progenitor cell numbers in each compartment will be identified and those with higher ratios will be defined as having poorer quality. The quality of these compartments will then be correlated with the age of the marrow donor to provide quantitation of the stem cell compartments with aging. Because some alterations in stem cell compartments with aging may result from an altered balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, Aim #2 will analyze blood from the same patients for interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor, transforming growth factor beta and insulin-like growth factor one levels along with complete blood counts. These findings and the age and the general health status of the donor, assessed using standardized instruments, will be correlated with the stem cell compartment quality identified in Aim #1. In Aim #3 the marrow donors will be stratified based on having greater versus less than average stem cell compartment quality and this information will be correlated with the surgical outcomes of the patients as well as the appearance or progression of chronic or hematopoietic disease over time. The hypothesis predicts that patients with lower quality stem cell compartments will do less well and will have more confounding problems than those with high quality stem cell compartments and that health status will decline more rapidly with aging in those with poorer quality stem cell compartments. This research will validate laboratory assays of stem cell compartment quality which can then be applied to clinical situations and may reveal blood cytokine assays with surrogate predictive value.","256115",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary: Recent clinical studies have suggested that elevated levels of circulating stem cells may decrease the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. Aging has been linked to decreased stem cell functional capacity under conditions of stress, a lower number of circulating stem cells, and an attenuation of the stress induced increase in these circulating cells. In addition, the use of human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has been faced with tremendous controversy. Therefore adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (aBMSCs) and ESCs may not be optimal for stem cell transplantation after cardiac injury. BMSCs from younger hosts, such as neonates (nBMSC), may be better equipped to survive during conditions of ischemia, and may provide a greater degree of protection during I/R injury. Our hypothesis therefore, is that nBMSCs will provide greater protection to injured myocardium during I/R induced injury. To make significant advancements toward this goal, we propose the following four specific aims: 1) To determine whether nBMSCs exhibit higher levels of protective growth factors and lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines compared to aBMSCs. 2) To determine whether nBMSCs have a higher rate of proliferation, higher pluripotent potential, or increased levels of activated p38, ERK, JNK, or Akt that contribute to the differences observed in cytokine production. 3) To determine whether nBMSCs confer a greater degree of cardioprotection during I/R injury as measured via isolated Langendorff preparation. 4) To determine whether nBMSCs provide greater cardioprotection by decreasing cellular apoptosis via upregulation of the PI3/Akt, SOCS3 or STATS signaling cascades. Relevance to public health: Stem cells may be a new treatment to help patient's who suffer from many different diseases. Understanding the ways that stem cells help patients will allow scientists to create ""super"" stem cells that both survive better in stressful conditions and release protective growth substances.

 issue failure and inadequate repair responses have been documented. The OA paradox is that despite the
aging-related deficiencies in cartilage cell function, OA cartilage pathology is the consequence of cell
activation which does not result in successful tissue repair but in destruction and abnormal modification of
existing matrix and production of matrix components that are not part of normal articular cartilage, indicative
of an abnormal cell differentiation.
We propose the hypothesis that cartilage aging is associated with loss, abnormal differentiation and
dysfunction that differentially affects cartilage cell subpopulations. Mature chondrocytes are reduced through
apoptotic mechanisms and compromised in function. Adult stem cells are present in aging cartilage but
chondrocytic differentiation is compromised by aging-associated changes in signaling mechanisms and the
 nflammatory milieu of OA.
AIM 1: Chondrocyte aging: an analysis of cartilage zones and cell subpopulations.
 artilage cell subpopulations (differentiated chondrocytes and progenitor cells) in specific zones of normal
aging and OA cartilage will be identified using cell surface and differentiation markers. Aging-associated
changes in frequency will be correlated with OA histopathology, and markers of abnormal chondrocyte
differentiation. In vitro analysis of cell functions will be performed by stimulation of cartilage explants and in
situ measurement of activation and differentiation markers.
 AIM 2: Sox9 expression and activation.
 Sox9 is a key regulator of chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage specific gene expression but its role in
 articular chondrocyte differentiation and in activation of differentiated chondrocytes remains to be
 established. Preliminary studies suggest changes in Sox9 expression in aging and OA chondrocytes. The
 proposed studies will address details of Sox9 expression and activation in aging and OAchondrocytes.
 AIM 3: TGFG activation of Sox9: role in chondrocyte activation and differentiation and changes in aging.
 TGFG regulates chondrogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells and this is in part mediated via Smad3
 dependent Sox9 activation and by MAP kinase pathways.TGFC. also activates differentiated articular
 chondrocytes but these responses are compromised with aging. This aim will address the role of Smad and
 MAP kinase signaling and Sox9 in TGFB-mediated activation of normal and aging chondrocytes.
 The results from the proposed studies will add important new information on chondrocyte biology, cartilage
 aging and osteoarthritis pathophysiology.","543869",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this research is to understand how the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) functions in space and developmental time to control anterior/posterior (A/P) limb patterning. The chick and mouse developing limbs provide a system where a combination of experimental manipulations can be combined with molecular and genetic approaches to understand how patterned structures are specified, determined and realized. During the past decade, the effector molecules of limb bud signaling centers were defined. However, how the signaling centers are established and the precise targets of the effector molecules are poorly understood. This is especially true for the ZPA, acting through the secreted protein Sonic hedgehog (SHH). There are three aims that cover ZPA function from its initiation, through signaling to target cells, to the function of the interdigits as signaling centers downstream of SHH. Using experimental and molecular techniques, we will: determine the minimal sequence(s) of the chick and mouse conserved Lmbr1 intron 5 region that are necessary for Shh expression in the ZPA; use the oligozeugodactyly mutant limb as a model system to analyze the effects of SHH signaling on target gene expressions and development of limb phenotypes; and test the role of the interdigits as signaling centers functioning through Tbx genes and BMP signaling. To accomplish these aims, we have developed and validated new techniques that include a reporter assay for in vivo enhancer analysis in the chick limb; the use of ultrasound (sonoporation) to express genes ectopically in limited areas of the developing limb; and an in vivo Luciferase reporter assay that permits quantitation of BMP signaling. While the members of my laboratory are highly accomplished in the techniques and experimental designs needed to carry out these aims, we also have engaged experts, with whom we meet regularly, to assist in trouble shooting and data interpretation. Accomplishment of the aims of this proposal has significant implications for understanding human limb malformations. These malformations are among the highest among human live births. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of normal limb development will lead to insights into why limb malformations occur. This is a necessary step toward preventing and/or curing them through regenerative biological and medical approaches.

Normal vocal fold vibration is crucially dependent upon tissue composition and viscoelasticity. When composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the vocal fold cover (i.e., lamina propria) is altered, vocal fold vibratory function can be severely disrupted due to alterations in tissue viscoelasticity. The dysphonias that result are generally difficult to treat effectively with current surgical paradigms and available biomaterials. Treatment failures have been ascribed to poor understanding of pathologic processes in the ECM, as well as suboptimal materials that may negatively affect vocal fold biomechanical properties. Accordingly, there is a clinical need for improved understanding of the pathophysiology of disrupted ECM and the development of advanced biomaterials that appreciate the biomechanical properties of the lamina propria. The long-term aim of this project is to engineer injectable products that promote wound repair and induce tissue regeneration, both for prophylactic treatment and for existing ECM defects of the lamina propria, i.e., scarring. We will focus on hyaluronic acid (HA) and its derivatives. These products will mimic normal ECM composition and yield optimal vocal fold ECM biomechanical properties. We will accomplish our long-term aim through a unique combination of systematic chemical, biomechanical, in vitro and in vivo animal studies. The overarching hypothesis is that in vivo ECM manipulation with injectable HA agents will yield optimal tissue composition and biomechanically functional results.","524299",

reduced costs to other UAB CCBSR investigators. The centralization of the production of human bone cells
ensures cost-effectiveness and improves the overall quality of the human bone cell preparations, which is
ensured by adherence to a quality assurance plan that includes testing of the differentiation potential of the

provides murine cells and, in this-competitive renewal, proposes to provide siRNA gene expression reagents
and techniques. This will reduce developmental and production costs, while improving the overall quality of
the reagents.
A key element of the Core is educational support dnd activities that enable investigators to utilize human
bone cells in their research efforts. The Core has proven invaluable in improving the productivity of
investigators in the area of basic bone biology research, having supported more than 100 projects that have
resulted in 59 publications to date. Most of these projects have been instigated by CCBSR members and all
of the pilot and feasibility project investigators have used the core. To date the Core has proven invaluable
in supporting innovative research in the areas of bone cell differentiation and function, micrdgravity and druginduced
bone loss, the bone loss associated with rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer-associated alterations in
bone cells. Notably, it has supported truly interdisciplinary, innovative research in the areas of the implant
biology and the development of gene therapy strategies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past funding period, we focused on the production of new, immature B-cells in aged mice by assessing kinetics of production, number of cells produced/day, and population turnover in the bone marrow and spleen. We found that B-lineage precursors decline with age, but newly-made B cells are generated in the bone marrow of aged animals at about the same rate as that observed in young animals. In spite of ongoing formation of new B-cells in the aged, few of these newly-made B-cells become part of the transitional or mature B-cell pools in the spleens. Kinetic studies indicate that splenic B-cells turn over very slowly and are long-lived in aged mice. We and others have concluded that B-cell homeostasis differs in aged mice from the well described homeostatic patterns of young mice. Furthermore, our results imply that a major defect is the inability of immature B-cells to join the peripheral B cell compartments. Adoptive transfer studies show that even young immature B-cells cannot home effectively to an aged spleen, suggesting a deficiency in the aged tissue microenvironment. In contrast, immature B-cells from aged mice are equally able to home to spleen compared to those from young mice. The tissue architecture of aged spleen and lymph nodes is disrupted in appearance and chemokine production is reduced, which likely alters lymphocyte migration and homeostasis. Thus, our results emphasize the acute need to know more about how immune homeostasis changes with age. Two general premises are addressed in this renewal application: (1) We hypothesize that B-cell homeostasis changes because the marrow and splenic microenvironments are altered during aging. (2) We propose that alterations in the microenvironments are modulated by changes in the types of B-cells populating the marrow and secondary tissues. Aim I will define the deficiencies of the aged lymphoid microenvironment that affect B-cell homeostasis and the homing and retention of newly-made B-cells. Aim II addresses the hypothesis that the long-lived, mature B-cells found in the spleens of aged mice are insufficient to maintain chemokine production and normal lymphoid compartmentalization. Aim III proposes that mature and effector B-cell populations (plasma cells), which are retained in bone marrow in increasing numbers with age, actually alter the ability of marrow stromal cells to function in B-lymphopoiesis. We believe that changes in B-cell homeostasis may predict poor immune function in the aged.

cells by introducing single chain fragment variable domains (scFvs) of antibodies as targeting moieties to the
cell membrane. Possibility of transferring this approach to other cell types can broaden the range of cells for
cancer applications. Among cell types tested as cellular vehicles, mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) are
a good candidate due to favorable combination of intrinsic properties. The ability of these cells to home to
the sites of tissue injury or growing tumors makes them suitable for the cell-based delivery in cancer settings.
This application seeks to apply a targeting approach to cell carriers to test our hypothesis that native tumor
homing efficiency of MPC-based cell vectors can be modulated via expressing targeting moiety. Thus,
together with fulfillments of the additional vector properties, such as loading with anti-cancer therapeutics,
MPC may successfully serve as cell vehicles for gene delivery in cancer settings. This targeting strategy
could be generally applicable not only to MPC but to other useful cell types currently are in testing as cell
vehicles. In the long run,all targeting efforts would facilitate the delivery of more effective, less toxic cancer
therapy. Our Specific Aims (SA): SA 1: To design genetically targeted MPC via cell surface expression of
tumor-specific single chain antibodies. SA 2: To evaluate targeting gains of MPC expressing targeting
moieties in vivo using model system. SA 3: To evaluate therapeutic gains of targeted MPC loaded with anti-
cancer therapeutics in a xenograft murine model.","174600",

Ideally, an engineered graft should be autologous and tailored to (re)establish the structure and function of a lost or damaged tissue. Engineered tissues with such a high level of structural and functional complexity would also foster fundamental research by serving as physiologically relevant models for controlled quantitative studies. The application is for tissue engineering of human stratifed grafts suitable for mandibular condyle replacement, a tissue of great clinical interest and an excellent model for studies of stem cell differentiation and functional assembly into craniofacial tissues. We hypothesize that craniofacial structures with physiological gradients of structural and mechanical properties can be grown in vitro by biophysical regulation of adult human stem cells. We thus propose to engineer mandibular tissue grafts by culturing adult human stem cells on specialized scaffolds in advanced bioreactors. Aim 1 will focus on the development of modular bioreactors with environmental control, interstitial flow, mechanical loading and imaging compatibility. Aim 2 will focus on the development of silk protein scaffolds with spatial gradients of immobilized growth factors. In Aim 3, the advanced scaffolds and bioreactors will be utilized to engineer human tissue constructs with structural and mechanical properties resembling those of native condyles. The resulting grafts are expected to have sufficiently high fidelity for use in studies of stem cell responses to genetic and environmental signals and to yield tissue grafts for further studies and eventual application in regenerative medicine. Our overall scientific goal is to obtain new critical information that will improve our understanding of the phenomena and mechanisms involved in human stem cell differentiation during cranio- and orofacial tissue development. The related practical goal is to establish in vitro systems that can be used to study the self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells in a manner predictable of their behavior in vivo, and to custom-design tissue grafts by directed differentiation of human stem cells.","541124",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation pneumonitis after intentional or accidental exposure to a radioactive source, is associated with damage or loss of lung endothelial and epithelial cells, the release of cytokines, an accumulation of inflammatory cells within the alveolar spaces, and later, pulmonary fibrosis. It is the goal of this grant proposal to investigate approaches to mitigate radiation-induced lung injury in a large animal model. The agents selected for the study will have different putative mechanisms for mitigating the effect of the ionizing radiation on the lungs. In aim 1, we will determine the local dose of radiation to the lung which predictably induces radiation pneumonitis when administered in combination with total body irradiation. In aim 2, we will evaluate the effect of the study agents at the dose of radiation predicted to induce lung injury in aim 1. First, we will investigate the effect of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) otherwise known as palifermin on the development of radiation pneumonitis. KGF stimulates type II pneumocytes and in rodents is protective for the lungs after radiation exposure and in other lung injury models. We will then assess the effect of primary bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) on the development of radiation pneumonitis. It has been reported that MSC have directed migration to injured tissue and have mitigated tissue injury in models of ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion. MSC are immunomodulatory and may also contribute to the reconstitution of injured lung tissue. Finally, A2A adenosine receptor (AR) agonists will be tested. AR agonists have been shown to induce anti-apoptotic signals in tissue injury models and are anti-inflammatory. In aim 3, the study agent found to be most effective in aim 2 will be tested at an increased dose of radiation to the lung. Preclinical development of effective strategies for the mitigation of radiation-induced lung injury in a large animal model will increase the probability of successful treatment of victims exposed to ionizing radiation from a nuclear weapon or a 'dirty bomb'.

on a detailed understanding of disease pathogenesis. Mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 trigger incompletely
understood signals that cause epithelial dedifferentiation, proliferation and cyst formation. Cysts lead to
functional renal impairment through both nephron loss and peritubular fibrosis. Our laboratory originally
identified Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (Kim-1) a type 1 membrane protein that is undetectable in normal
kidneys, but undergoes strong induction after renal injury. Cells that express Kim-1 express mesenchymal
markers such as vimentin and have increased proliferative rates. Strong expression of Kim-1 is seen in both
human ADPKD kidneys and in the cystic kidneys of the PKD2(WS25/1) mouse, where its expression is
associated with decreased complexity and quantity of basolateral staining for Na-K-ATPase. The interstitial
cells surrounding Kim-1-expressing tubules demonstrate both high proliferative activity and staining for
myofibroblast smooth muscle a-actin. In vitro studies indicate that Kim-1 promotes epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT). Heterologous Kim-1 expression drives down-regulation of E-cadherin,
upregulation of vimentin, activation of the small GTPase Rho and increased paracellular permeability. We
hypothesize that in ADPKD Kim-1 contributes to both cyst formation and renal fibrosis by driving EMT.
Kim-1 may be downstream of PCI (the PKD1 protein product) which normally acts to suppress Kim-1
expression. In this case mutant PCI may induce Kim-1 and drive epithelial dedifferentiation.
In the first aim, we will use live cell imaging and biochemical techniques to determine the effect of
Kim-1 expression on PCI function and the PCI protein complex. Specifically, we will test the effect of Kim-
1 on E-cadherin stability in the adherens junction of renal epithelial cells, cilia structure and cilia-dependent
mechanosensation. In the second aim we will develop a transgenic mouse overexpressing Kim-1 in proximal
tubules using Cre-Lox technology. We will determine whether Kim-1 overexpression accelerates cyst
formation and renal fibrosis in the context of PCI haploinsufficiency. Together, these studies will provide
important information regarding the mechanisms of cyst formation in ADPKD, and will validate Kim-1 as a
therapeutic target in ADPKD."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In adult organisms, cells localized primarily in the bone marrow and in low number in other organs have the ability to differentiate into multiple cell phenotypes. One current of repair of injured tissue invokes mobilization and homing of these progenitor cells to sites of injury and their differentiation into organ parenchymal cell types. However, progenitor cells have also been implicated in promoting fibrogenesis by differentiating into lung fibroblasts. Based on our and others studies, we hypothesize that bone marrow derived progenitor cells may promote either lung repair or fibrosis, depending on the nature of the injury and the immune proclivity of the host. In this project we propose to clarify the roles of bone marrow derived stem cells in acute and chronic lung injury. We will conduct studies in a novel rodent model, a genetically modified T-bet deficient mice will be treated chronically with bleomycin to induce progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:   
1. In response to a single episode of injury, mesenchymal stem cells contribute to effective repair of the injured lung by modulating the inflammatory response, favoring transient fibrogenesis essential to remodeling and differentiating into lung parenchymal cells.   
2. Prolonged or repeated lung injury provokes a maladaptive repair response in which mesenchymal stem cells promote fibrogenesis by favoring a persistent Th2 type immune response and by localizing in the lungs and differentiating into fibroblasts that contribute directly to the fibrosis.   
3. A persistent Th2 bias of CD4+ T lymphocytes promotes a maladaptive response to lung injury. Administration of mesenchymal stem cells to Th2 biased animals will exaggerate the fibrotic response to bleomycin .  
To test these hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:   
1. Using an animal model of progressive pulmonary fibrosis, to compare responses of the lungs to single and multiple intratracheal instillations of bleomycin.   
2. To determine effects of mesenchymal stem cell transfer on repeated bleomycin induced lung injury. 3. In vitro and in vivo to determine the role of chemoattractant factors (SDF-1) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13) and TGFf31, in the processes of localization, proliferation and differentiation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in the lungs after continues injury.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional control of adipogenesis in vivo is a complex process involving a large number of genes and phenotype specific as well as general regulatory proteins. Many of these factors, their cognate elements and their functional co-factors are all present in a rate limiting concentration, and must assemble into distinct multi-component regulatory complexes to selectively activate or suppress target genes in response to physiological and developmental cues. Age related changes result in increased adiposity in the musculoskeletal system and concomitant decreased activity of bone-forming osteoblast and thus represent a potentially serious health risk. Key regulators of adipogenesis, lipid and glucose homeostasis have been identified and include members of the CAATT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) family and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR). Null mutation of these factors results in lethality and loss of adipogenesis. Similarly, Runx2/Cbfa1 is an obligatory factor for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation during embryonic development. Runx2 gene ablation cause complete failure of skeleton formation and results in embryonic lethality. Recent finding indicates an inverse relationship between the numbers of adipocytes and osteoblasts in bone during aging and in pathological conditions. However it is unclear why aging leads to adipogenesis. Osteoblasts and adipocytes originate from a common progenitor which arises from mesenchymal stroma/stem cells in marrow. Thus, Runx2 represent a paradigm to functionally address the enhanced adipogenesis at the expense of osteogenesis in aging subjects. Our proposed studies will address molecular mechanisms involved in this switch by a regulated ablation of the Runx2 protein, or expression of a mutant Runx2 protein that is compromise in its ability to negatively regulate adipocytic differentiation using both ex-vivo and in vivo mouse models. We hypothesized that Runx2 functional activity to ""prime"" progenitor cells to osteoblasts is altered in aging skeleton thus favoring differentiation towards adipocytes. Our long term objectives are to identify molecular mechanisms regulating the differential/bi-polar activities of Runx2 during adipocytic and osteogenic differentiation. These studies may be translated to novel therapies for congenital and degenerative skeletal diseases, metabolic bone disorders and aging.

The mechanism of increased bone resorption with estrogen is not fully understood, but there is good evidence for effects on osteoclastic precursors of the hematopoietic lineage, and on the osteoblastic cells of mesenchymal lineage that interact with hematopoietic cells to produce osteoclasts. Circulating osteoclast precursors have been clearly demonstrated in peripheral blood, and there is some evidence for circulating osteoblast precursors as well 2. We have shown that short term estrogen treatment can alter the expression of receptor activator of NFligand (RANKL) indicating an effect on the osteoblastic lineage, and the response to macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) and RANKL, indicating an effect on hematopoietic lineage. Initial aim of this study will be to analyze osteoclastogenesis in peripheral blood before and after estrogen treatment, when MCSF, RANKL and other direct stimulators of osteoclastogenesis are added, thus testing the effects on hematopoietic lineage. RANKL expression will also be measured, and if changes are observed, then additional studies to isolate and analyze effects of estrogen on cells of osteoblastic lineage can be carried out. "," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The focus of this research proposal is the development of a tissue engineered ligament graft for ACL regeneration. Currently, ACL injuries are the most common knee injury in the United States. As the population places more emphasis on physical activity to combat the obesity epidemic and the level of intensity in individual sports increases, the number of ACL injuries is likely to rise. Current reconstruction strategies are not sufficient for successful long-term clinical outcomes and a new method to repair the ACL-deficient knee is needed. An ACL reconstruction that results in an increased quality of life for the patient may be possible through tissue engineering techniques. Our cell-based approach utilizes mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a progenitor cell source suitable for musculoskeletal tissue engineering strategies. By directing lineage commitment of MSCs, a suitable tissue can be formed. We propose to engineer ligament tissue by combining three techniques: electrospun fiber meshes, mechanical stretch and scleraxis-expresssing MSCs. We hypothesize that the fiber architecture of the biomaterial, namely fiber orientation and diameter, will affect MSC response to mechancial stretch and the subsequent development of extracellular matrix. Further, we postulate that MSCs with constitutive overexpression of the ligament/tendon transcription factor, scleraxis, will act synergistically with electrospun biomaterials to promote ligament tissue development. Therefore, we propose two specific aims: (1) To determine the effect of fiber architecture under mechanical stretch on ligament tissue formation. (2) To determine the potential of scleraxis-modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultured on electrospun polymers on the formation of ligament tissue. Stem cell differentiation to ligament tissue phenotype will be characterized by gene expression and extracellular matrix protein deposition. The long term goal of this project is an engineered ligament capable of integration and regeneration once implated at the site of injury. The studies outlined in this proposal will generate a platform for developing functional ligaments using a multidimensional approach involving polymeric biomaterial architecture and mechanical stretch as well as genetic engineering.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Acute respiratory failure from acute lung injury is a major clinical problem with substantial mortality and morbidity. The overall objective of this proposal is to test the value of cell-based therapy with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) for the treatment of experimental acute lung injury and restoring normal lung fluid balance in acute lung injury. Aim 1 is designed to determine the therapeutic effects of intrapulmonary and intravenous delivery of MSC on pulmonary edema and survival in clinically relevant mouse models of acute lung injury. Aim 2 will evaluate the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of MSC treatment in the clinically relevant models of pulmonary edema from acute lung injury in mice studied in Aim 1, with a specific focus on the role of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and interleukin-10. Aim 3 is designed to test the therapeutic and mechanistic effects of allogeneic human MSC on restoring alveolar epithelial fluid transport in an in vitro model of cultured human alveolar epithelial type II cells and in an ex vivo perfused human lung preparation. The proposed studies in Aims 1 and 2 will advance our understanding of the mechanisms by which MSCs reduce lung injury and pulmonary edema as well as advance our knowledge of the biology of MSCs in the setting of acute lung injury in mice. Aim 3 will translate these findings to the human lung by using cultured monolayers of polarized human alveolar epithelial type II cells and an ex vivo perfused human lung preparation. The results of these experiments will help make it possible to determine whether testing MSCs in patients with acute lung injury is appropriate. The proposed work will also uncover mechanisms by which MSC reduces pulmonary edema from acute lung injury, and these insights will advance the fields of lung fluid balance, pulmonary edema, and acute lung injury. PROJECT NARRATIVE. This research proposal has direct relevance to the clinical problem of acute respiratory failure from pulmonary edema secondary to acute lung injury, a cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The proposal will test novel strategies to use cell based therapy for the treatment of experimental acute lung injury including mouse models of lung injury as well as innovative models that use human lung epithelial cells and intact human lungs harvested from brain dead subjects.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are one of the most extensively studied adult stem cells and have broad potential uses. A few of their uses include, studying developmental pathways, disease modeling, in vitro toxicology models, compound screening, humanized animal models and potentially cellular therapy. Although MSC are proliferative, a drawback with these cells is that unlike human embryonic stem cell (ESC), MSC are not immortal stem cells. For any application that uses large quantities of MSC, such as high throughput drug compound screening, eventually MSC will have to be re-derived, likely from a different genetic background, thus assay responses may differ among genetic backgrounds and could reduce assay consistency and robustness. If reporter genes are added or line specific characteristics are found, these unique characteristics may be lost when MSC are freshly isolated from different genotypes. Aruna Biomedical proposes to develop turnkey kits containing human ESC derived monolayer cultures of MSC that can be reliably and quantitatively differentiated into MSC derived lineages. This project follows the model set forth in a previous NIH STTR to Aruna for neural stem cells. That grant resulted in the first human ESC derived product commercially available to the research community. These Aruna kits and services are for neural stem cell researchers and we currently provide custom assays for drug discovery to major pharmaceutical companies. We have preliminary data to suggest that this same monolayer differentiation and culture platform technology will generate uniform MSC under the right conditions. For this project, we propose to 1) repeatedly derive adherent cultures of MSC populations from human ESCs (WA09), and then 2) demonstrate reproducible MSC lineage differentiation of hESC derived MSC cells, leading to a phase II application that will produce an optimized process. In turn these will provide never before available MSC kits to the research community in multiple formats 1) a kit containing the cells and reagents needed to propagate and differentiate the ESC derived MSC into multiple lineages 2) a reagent kit to researchers who wish to derive their own human MSC lines from ESC. This will allow researchers to add specific markers, make genetic changes to a master ESC line prior to the derivation of the MSC and then re-derive MSC from the master ESC line again at a later date 3) customized genetically modified MSC to meet the needs of the researchers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mesenchymal stem cells are useful in cell therapy and stem cell research but they have a limited lifespan in culture. We will develop a unique and limitless supply of mesenchymal stem cells derived from human embryonic stem cells, opening up new uses and enhance existing uses of these important cell types.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Project Summary: This project will define two distinct lineages of inflammatory macrophages, determine their cellular origins, their respective roles in the innate response to kidney injury and subsequent processes of repair, and identify the role of a key determinant that may regulate the phagocytic function of one distinct macrophage lineage. In order to carry out this project the candidate will: 1) Determine the origins and functions of distinct populations of macrophages in the kidney; 2) study the expression and function of gpNMB, a molecule expressed selectively by a distinct subpopulation of kidney macrophages that may mediate repair and remodeling.  
The candidate has experience working on inflammatory macrophages and their role in kidney injury and repair, and has published in this area. Two years ago he moved from Prof Savill's group in the UK to Prof Bonventre's group at Harvard in order to focus more on animal models of tissue repair, with particular relevance to the kidney. Complementing his background in the study of macrophages with the scientific environment in the Bonventre lab has resulted in the candidate's ability to propose novel hypotheses relating to the biology of macrophages in vivo during kidney injury and repair. The candidate now has considerable preliminary data. He will master many of the in vivo techniques in the proposal, including, lineage tracing by bone marrow chimerism, Cre-Lox technology and reproducible modeling of injury and repair in the kidney. In addition the proposed study will enable acquisition of skills in proteomics, laser capture microdissection, retroviral gene expression/silencing and molecular cloning. There are accomplished colleagues in the Bonventre laboratory, and nearby at Harvard Medical School who will assist in these areas of development. Relevance: In common diseases affecting the kidney currently lacking therapies, macrophages contribute to scarring and organ damage. However, the same cell-type is the principal immune cell that orchestrates repair. It is proposed that the reason for this paradox is that there are two distinct types of tissue macrophage. My goal is to define these two types of macrophage so that novel therapies can be developed to target one type over another.

This
laboratory has focused over the past decade on the role of specific matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and
MT1-MMP) in this process. MMP-2, in conjuction with MT1-MMP, is sufficient to induce the conversion of the
polarized epithelial cell to a fibroblastic phenotype, a processtermed epithelial mesenchymal transition
(EMT). Quantitatively, EMT, in conjunction with activation and expansion of the interstitial fibroblast
population, is a major contributor to tubular atrophy and progressiverenal fibrosis. In vitro, EMT is driven by
a diverse number of cytokines and environmental factors; however, we have postulated that renal EMT
represents a metastable state driven by three dominant transcriptional networks: TGF-beta/Smad; E-
cadherin/beta-catenin/Wnt/LEF/TCF; and MAPK/ERKsignaling cascades. We have identified both MMP-2
and MT1-MMP as transcriptional targets of the MAPK/ERKsignaling cascades and determined that a
specific AP-1 complex component, Fra-2, is sufficient to drive the process of EMT in vitro. The primary
hypothesis of this proposal is that sustained MAPK/ERK signaling, with enhanced generation of Fra-2, drives
the transcription of a defined cohort of genes required for renal EMT. The approaches to this problem include
three Specific Aims proposing to characterize, using microarray analysis, Fra-2-regulated genes in a series
of clonal populations of epithelial cells displaying a range of epithelial to mesenchymal features. The
functional significance of identified genes will be validated using in vitro and in vivo approaches, including a
unique model of renal EMT generated by the transgenic expressionof active MMP-2 in the renal proximal
tubule. Finally, the ability of Fra-2, alone, to induce EMT in vivo will be tested by the transgenic proximal
tubule expression of this transcription factor. These studies are designed to identify those gene sets required
for renal EMT and thereby hopefully provide new therapeutic targetsfor the treatment of renal disease.","321872",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Na,K-ATPase, consisting of a- and p-subunits, is a key regulator of sodium and potassium ion homeostasis in mammalian cells. In addition to its enzyme activity, the subunits are crucial to maintain the well- differentiated phenotype of epithelial cells. Reduced p-subunit expression is associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) that occurs during cancer development. It has been shown that increased expression of the transcription suppressor protein, Snail, is elevated in invasive and metastatic cancer cells. We have previously demonstrated that the Na,K-ATPase prsubunit is suppressed by Snail in carcinoma cells. The first specific aim of this proposal examines the molecular mechanism by which Snail suppresses the transcription of Na,K-ATPase prsubunit. In the second aim, a novel assay will be employed to identify small molecules that might up-regulate Prsubunit expression in cancer cells. These studies should reveal insights into the role of pi-subunit in normal and cancer cells.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Reagents for the clonal isolation/enrichment of stem cell populations with mesenchymal tissue differentiation capacity are currently limiting. In this application, we propose a systematic effort to produce cell surface marker antibodies for these cells. These antibodies would provide the means to sort and purify distinct cell populations allowing meaningful gene expression studies to discover molecules important for the maintenance of stem/progenitor cells at different developmental stages. They will also allow the localization of stem cells in tissues. In addition, these markers may allow isolation of sufficient stem cells for ex vivo tissue engineering, or even within the operating room, such that a concentration of cells with differentiation capacity can be used for repair or regeneration of skeletal tissues without need for further in vitro isolation and expansion. We propose the use of a combination of techniques including a subtractive immunization protocol, a hybridoma growth method that allows management of large numbers of clones and screening methods that should allow discrete selection of relevant antibodies. We hypothesize that this approach will greatly increase the likelihood of generating specific adult stem cell antibodies over previously used methods. Our specific aim is to use subtractive immunizations to generate monoclonal antibodies against single cell suspensions of adult stem cells. Large scale screening will be done to identify antibodies that define important classes of stem cells. Sorted populations will be characterized for their properties of expandability and self-renewal. Novel antibodies to interesting stem cell populations will be identified. Specific antibody markers for stem/progenitor cells with the capacity to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues are lacking. The aim of this proposal is to develop novel antibodies that can be used to identify and sort these cells for the study of stem cell biology as well as for the purification of cells before therapeutic transplantation or before differentiation and subsequent transplantation.

Articular cartilage injuries cannot self-repair and if left unattended, will lead to osteoarthritis (OA) of the
affected joints. A number of different procedures have been developed to repair damaged cartilage, yet a
therapeutic strategy that results in a functional and durable cartilage repair has not been achieved. For most
tissue engineering repair of osteochondral defects, a single-phase material that is usually deformable and mechanically
and structurally uniform has been tested, again without uniform success. One of the major causes
for failure of cartilage repair is non-integration between the repair tissue and the surrounding cartilage. Finite
element computer modeling indicates that excessive deformation of the repair tissue causes considerable
stress at the implant-host interface, which contributes to the failure of the repair tissue. Articular cartilage is a
structurally complex tissue, whose function partly depends on the support of intact subchondral bone. We hypothesize
that a biphasic composite gran system, one that provides the functional mechanical support at the
base of the osteochondral defect and the other that facilitates the repair of articular cartilage, is essential for
successful cartilage repair. This biphasic composite graft mimics the physiological structure of the osteochondral
interface and provides a favorable mechanical environment that reduces the stress level at the implant-
host interface, favoring host-repair tissue integration and facilitating functional repair. DBM has mechanical
integrity and contains a variety of intrinsic growth factors that are, at least, 20 times greater in volume
concentration than in serum. These growth factors are able to enhance bone healing and modulate the osteochondrogenesis
of progenitor cells and may contribute to the constant remodeling of bone tissue through
osteoclastic and osteoblastic activities. DBM functions as a reservoir of naturally balanced multiple bioactive
factors when it is used to repair bone or cartilage defects. Cartilage tissue can be engineered in vitro with either
bone marrow-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) or culture-expanded chondrocytes in a gelatin
sponge or hyaluronan (HA) carrier matrix. Special attention is provided to the optimization of the integration of
neo- tissue with that of the host by using HA-oligomers to facilitate such integration In this proposal, a novel
dual-phase composite graft composed of DBM and in vitro tissue engineered precartilage (MSCs or chondrocytes)
will be tested to repair an osteochondral defect. The objective is to re-evaluate the use of this mechanical
factor with a suitable collagenous delivery vehicle for the cell-based therapy of osteochondral defects. This
objective will be addressed by the following Specific Aims:

SPECIFIC AIM 1. To optimize the conditions for in vitro engineering of cartilage tissue with MSCs or chondrocytes
combined into the gelatin or HA matrix. The goal is to prepare an implantable cartilage tissue for
resurfacing of the cartilage defect.

SPECIFIC AIM 2. To test a biphasic composite graft in a rabbit model and assess the mechanism and sequential
events during the repair of osteochondral defects.

SPECIFIC AIM 3. To translate these small animal results from Specific Aims 1 and 2 to a larger, clinically relevant
animal model (goats) to develop a therapeutic strategy for repair of cartilage defects."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past funding period, we focused on the production of new, immature B-cells in aged mice by assessing kinetics of production, number of cells produced/day, and population turnover in the bone marrow and spleen. We found that B-lineage precursors decline with age, but newly-made B cells are generated in the bone marrow of aged animals at about the same rate as that observed in young animals. In spite of ongoing formation of new B-cells in the aged, few of these newly-made B-cells become part of the transitional or mature B-cell pools in the spleens. Kinetic studies indicate that splenic B-cells turn over very slowly and are long-lived in aged mice. We and others have concluded that B-cell homeostasis differs in aged mice from the well described homeostatic patterns of young mice. Furthermore, our results imply that a major defect is the inability of immature B-cells to join the peripheral B cell compartments. Adoptive transfer studies show that even young immature B-cells cannot home effectively to an aged spleen, suggesting a deficiency in the aged tissue microenvironment. In contrast, immature B-cells from aged mice are equally able to home to spleen compared to those from young mice. The tissue architecture of aged spleen and lymph nodes is disrupted in appearance and chemokine production is reduced, which likely alters lymphocyte migration and homeostasis. Thus, our results emphasize the acute need to know more about how immune homeostasis changes with age. Two general premises are addressed in this renewal application: (1) We hypothesize that B-cell homeostasis changes because the marrow and splenic microenvironments are altered during aging. (2) We propose that alterations in the microenvironments are modulated by changes in the types of B-cells populating the marrow and secondary tissues. Aim I will define the deficiencies of the aged lymphoid microenvironment that affect B-cell homeostasis and the homing and retention of newly-made B-cells. Aim II addresses the hypothesis that the long-lived, mature B-cells found in the spleens of aged mice are insufficient to maintain chemokine production and normal lymphoid compartmentalization. Aim III proposes that mature and effector B-cell populations (plasma cells), which are retained in bone marrow in increasing numbers with age, actually alter the ability of marrow stromal cells to function in B-lymphopoiesis. We believe that changes in B-cell homeostasis may predict poor immune function in the aged.

Evidence has been growing that occupational voice users, such as teachers, telephone workers, ministers, counselors, interviewers, are at risk for vocal injury because they get inadequate recovery times from prolonged speaking. The underlying hypothesis is that there is a limited vibration dose that vocal fold tissues can withstand. As for hand-transmitted vibration in power tools use, a safe dose is governed by frequency, amplitude, and duration of vibration exposure. Microphone use solves the overdose problem related to vocal loudness, but does not address the problem of excessive duration. A voice dosimeter has been designed, tested, and is currently in use by teachers in the Denver area public school system to measure vocal dose. The teachers also self-monitor their vocal fatigue levels. In this renewal application, the primary focus will be on the molecular underpinnings of tissue response to excessive vibration. Specific aims are to (1) determine the ideal geometric and viscoelastic properties of the lamina propria, (2) quantify voice recovery times and relate them to auto-perceptive ratings, (3) culture distinct cell types at various states of differentiation, (4) determine the relative merits of co-culture for in vitro monolayer systems, (5) engineer a 3D in vitro model of the lamina propria in a bioreactor, (6) identify and functionally characterize candidate vibration-responsive genes, (7) develop a theoretical model of economic voice production, and (8) explore two types of economy-based vocal therapy. The ultimate goal is to provide heavy voice users with safety criteria based on genetic disposition to vocal injury, degree of training in economic voice use, accumulated dose of vibration in a typical work day, and the amount of recovery available at night and on weekends. A multi-disciplinary research team has been assembled to address this public health concern at physical, biochemical, molecular, and behavioral levels of investigation.","7038",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World Health Organization (WHO) Consensus document cites that bone related diseases account for half of all chronic conditions in people over 65 and with the rate of osteoporotic fractures doubling in the last decade, nearly 40% of all women over 50 will eventually suffer from one. Thus, the replacement or restoration of traumatized, damaged or lost bone is a major clinical problem in the United States and around the world. The current implant materials even though they significantly helped to improve the quality of life of the young and aged patients, they have serious limitations. This coupled with the increasing clinical needs in this area provide the impetus for us to develop novel strategies to improve the performance of existing materials or custom develop novel materials. The unique approach proposed here in will combine the engineering expertise to develop novel multi energy aided fabrication techniques with the clinical expertise to evaluate its impact in skeletal regeneration/repair. The proposal aims to develop unique nanostructured metallic surfaces that could interact favorably with osteoblast/stem cells to increase osseointegration of the implants. The proof of concept evaluation will be established through the proposed study. PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will lead to the development of novel surface modified metallic substrates with nanostructures as ideal implant materials for orthopaedic applications.

surrounding tissues and metastasis to distant organs, even at an early stage of tumor progression. The poor
prognosis of this malignancy also reflects a generally poor response to current therapies. Thus, a basic
understanding of the biology of these tumors and the mechanisms that promote their invasion and
metastasis will provide a basis for developing new methods for diagnosis and treatment.
Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are characterized by extensive deposition of extracellular matrix, which can
have profound effects on cell behavior. We have preliminary studies showing that cells derived from
pancreatic adenocarcinomas respond in vitro to exogenous collagen type I by undergoing a transformation
From a non-motile epithelial cell to a highly motile and invasive mesenchymal cell. A hallmark of epithelial to
mesenchymal transitions is increased expression of N-cadherin, a protein we and others have shown
promotes tumor cell invasion. Of particular significance to the current proposal, N-cadherin is expressed by
more than 50% of invasive pancreatic tumors.
Recent studies have shown that the N-cadherin antagonist, Exherin¿, developed by Adherex Technologies,
Inc. Durham, NC, inhibits the activity of N-cadherin in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that Exherin¿ is
capable of inhibiting N-cadherin-induced motility in tumor cells, and propose to test this hypothesis in Ncadherin-
expressing pancreatic cancer cells in a tissue culture model of cell motility, and in a mouse model
of invasive pancreatic cancer. In addition, we propose to characterize the signaling pathways downstream of
collagen I that promote up-regulation of N-cadherin and invasion, for the purpose of identifying potential
inhibitors that could be used in combination therapy with Exherin¿. Finally, we will test the efficacy of
Exherin¿ as a treatment for human pancreatic cancer in clinical trials."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States.  Invasion and metastasis are the most lethal characteristics of breast cancer and the leading cause of breast cancer-related death.  TGF-? normally inhibits breast cancer development by preventing mammary epithelial cell (MEC) proliferation, or by inducing MEC apoptosis.  Mammary tumorigenesis counteracts the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-?, thus enabling TGF-? to stimulate breast cancer invasion and metastasis.  Fundamental gaps exist in our knowledge of how malignant MECs overcome the cytostatic actions of TGF-?, and of how TGF-? stimulates the development and progression of mammary tumors.  These knowledge gaps have prevented science and medicine from developing treatments effective in antagonizing the oncogenic activities of TGF-? in developing and progressing breast cancers.  We recently established ?v?3 integrin and Src as essential mediators of TGF-?-stimulated MAP kinase activation, cell invasion, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in normal and malignant MECs.  Based on these and other preliminary findings, we hypothesize that aberrant activation of ?v?3 integrin and Src in developing breast cancers promotes the oncogenic function of TGF-? and its induction of breast cancer cell EMT, invasion, and metastasis by (i) inducing formation of ?v?3 integrin:TGF-? receptor complexes; (ii) stimulating Tyr phosphorylation of the TGF-¿ type I (T¿R-I) and type II (T¿R-II) receptors; and (iii) coordinating the formation Shc:Grb2:Gab1/2 complexes that amplify activation of MAP kinases by TGF-¿.  A corollary states that inactivating av¿3 integrin and Src function will prevent the conversion of TGF-¿ from a suppressor to a promoter of breast cancer growth and invasion, thereby alleviating breast cancer development and progression stimulated by TGF-¿.  Theses hypotheses will be addressed by three specific aims.  Specific Aim 1 will identify the ¿3 integrin and T¿R-II determinants that mediate av¿3 integrin:T¿R-II complex formation and mutants lacking these functions will be used to establish the role of av¿3 integrin:T¿R-II complexes in mediating oncogenic signaling by TGF-¿ in normal and malignant MECs.  Specific Aim 2 will identify the Tyr residues in T¿R-I and T¿R-II that are phosphorylated by Src and mutants lacking these functions will be used to determine the impact of these reactions on TGF-¿ function in normal and malignant MECs.  Specific Aim 3 will determine the effectiveness of interdicting av¿3 integrin and Src function in preventing TGF-¿ stimulation of breast cancer cell growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in mice.  These studies will provide valuable information on how TGF-¿ promotes breast cancer invasion and metastasis, and more importantly, on how to control these deadly processes by targeting the oncogenic activities of TGF-¿ through the development and use of av¿3 integrin and Src antagonists.  Moreover, application of our findings will enable science and medicine to, one day, improve the prognosis and treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The phenotype of the vascular endothelium changes dramatically in the evolution of a number of human vascular diseases, recapitulating changes seen during embryonic vascular development. A switch similar to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, activating migration and proliferation pathways, is seen during the angiogenic response to tumors or healing wounds and also during the restitution of vessels following inflammatory injury. This coupling of endothelial cell migration and proliferation reflects the linkage between cell fate decisions and cytoskeletal mechanics at functional, biochemical, and spatial levels. Migrating cells in particular display striking subcellular polarization of proximal signaling proteins which govern cytoskeletal dynamics as well as survival and proliferation pathways. Notably, endogenously- produced reactive oxidants have been shown to concentrate at the leading edge of migrating endothelial cells, and appear to be necessary for both locomotion and mitogenic signaling. These observations suggest that the endothelial cell oxidase may be similarly targeted to leading edge structures, and that such precise targeting may be essential to preserve the fidelity of oxidant-related signals. However, the molecular basis and biological rationale for such putative subcellular oxidase localization is virtually unknown. During the prior funding period, we identified a number of protein binding partners of the principal NADPH oxidase adapter, p47phox, and demonstrated the involvement of several protein-protein interactions in specifying oxidant-related signaling to specific signaling modules. In this application, we propose to examine in detail the role of these interactions in changing the endothelial phenotype, using a combination of microscopic, biochemical, and functional studies. Relevance to Public Health: Diseases that account for the leading causes of death in the United States, among them cancer and cardiovascular disease, involve fundamental changes in the phenotype of the vascular endothelium. We propose to investigate in detail one facet of the biochemical basis for these changes, in hopes of reversing or preventing these changes. This application is a competing renewal of R01-HL67256.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gingival overgrowth is a side effect of specific medications, and occurs as inherited and idiopathic forms (HGF). The condition impairs mastication, and predisposes affected individuals to systemic complications. Although gingival overgrowth lesions appear clinically similar, our studies have shown that the molecular and cellular features of gingival overgrowth vary as a function of the cause. Phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth and HGF lesions are highly fibrotic and contain high levels of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF); whereas cyclosporin A induced overgrowth is less fibrotic, and contains low amounts of CTGF; and nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth is intermediated in all respects. Recent studies have identified tissue specific pathways that provide the mechanism for elevated CTGF expression in fibrotic gingival tissues, and potential therapeutic strategies. In addition, we have published evidence that CTGF promotes extracellular matrix deposition via alpha-6 and beta-1 integrins. Preliminary data suggest that the process of epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to all forms of gingival overgrowth; and that a critically important matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-13) is down regulated in fibrotic forms of gingival overgrowth. Thus, two aims are proposed. In Aim 1 we will establish that EMT occurs in all forms of human gingival overgrowth in vivo, and we will evaluate the mechanism of inhibitors of EMT to block progression of abnormalities in in vitro studies of primary gingival epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Aim 2 proposes to evaluate the hypothesis that CTGF regulates extracellular collagen processing enzymes and a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-13), thereby increasing net extracellular matrix accumulation. Proposed studies will determine CTGF stimulated signal transduction pathways and regulated downstream genes that lead to increased extracellular matrix deposition. These studies take advantage of a peptide that inhibits CTGF-dependent extracellular matrix deposition that we have recently identified. The proposed experimental approach utilizes in situ analyses of human gingival overgrowth tissues, and primary cultured human gingival epithelial cells grown in monolayer and three dimensional configurations. Studies will identify novel cellular and molecular pathways that contribute to gingival overgrowth.

This type of sarcoma is typically characterized by the presence of constitutively activated KIT, the receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-KIT proto-oncogene. This observation has been successfully exploited in phase I and II trials, leading to FDA approval of Imatinib Mesylate (IM) (Gleevec() for patients with unresectable and/or metastatic GIST. The biological mechanisms of IM as well as its downstream molecular effects are for the most part unknown. In an attempt to further elucidate the mechanism of IM, we employed a DNA microarray-based approach to identify genetic changes and signaling pathways that were altered in response to IM in a GIST cell line. We identified a total of 148 genes or ESTs (out of 10,367) that were differentially regulated; 7 known genes displayed a sustained durable response over all time courses following treatment. The significantly down-regulated genes included Sprouty4A (SPRY4A), a member of a family of proteins that inhibit signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases. The only up-regulated gene, MAFbx, encodes for a protein that plays a role in muscle atrophy and is a member of the SCF family of E3 ubiquitin ligases. On a functional level, we demonstrated that IM rapidly inhibited autophosphorylation of KIT, and subsequent activation of AKT and ERK1/2 without affecting the total level of these proteins. Of interest our studies also found that differential expression of these response genes involved activation of MAPK-dependent as well as AKT- and MAPK-independent pathways. In an attempt to correlate these in vitro findings to clinical data, we examined GIST needle core biopsy specimens taken from patients before and after IM administration from patients participating in the  CSTI571-B2222 Phase II trial and demonstrated that expression levels of SPRY4 and MAFbx correlated well with clinical response. In the studies proposed, we will expand our gene profiling studies to evaluate new clinical GIST biopsies from patients on a multi-institutional RTOG clinical trial S-0132. Patients participating in this trial will have tumor biopsies before IM treatment and definitive resection of the disease at 8 weeks after the initiation of IM. Tissues will thus be available for these profiling studies to evaluate patterns of expression following IM therapy, which will be correlated with clinical outcome and the KIT or PDGFR-alpha mutational status. Next, we will build on the results of the gene profiling studies as well as our strong preliminary data to further elucidate the role of c-KIT in the pathogenesis of GISTs and determine if AKT is an essential down-stream mediator of IM response. Finally we will investigate the role of SPRY4A in the development of GISTs and the therapeutic response to IM by evaluating its ability to negatively regulate KIT signaling. The overall goal of this project is to identify important genetic markers of clinical response in order to better elucidate the molecular mechanisms of action of IM with the ultimate goal of improving the treatment of GISTs.","369590",

implementation of regenerative medicine and the reconstitution of diseased organs. Yet, equally significant
is their potential for providing insights into fundamental principles and mechanisms guiding early human
development. Embryonic stem cells have very specific culture requirements for the maintenance of
undifferentiated proliferation and pluripotency, beyond the routine cell culture practices feasible within
individual research projects. In addition, assays for their differentiation and modification are tedious and
laborious. We propose a new Embryonic Stem Cell Core for this P01 to support studies with hESC. We
propose 3 specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. To provide undifferentiated hESC for projects //, III, IV and maintain stocks of hESC,
conduct routine quality control, and characterize additional lines as necessary.
Specific Aim 2. To conduct preparation of embryoid bodies, teratomas and other procedures as needed by
individual projects.
Specific Aim 3. To train investigators' staff in hESC culture, manipulation, and modification for individual
experiments.
All of these activities are currently routine in the Pis lab, and their incorporation into this core will provide
opportunities for new synergistic studies with trophoblasts and endothelial cells, in support of research in the
regulation of angiogenesis at the maternal-fetal interface. It will also ensure consistent standards of
resources and practices with these new endeavors."," ",

A major limitation to the more widespread use of this material for adult patients is that the number of HSC in a cord blood sample may be insufficient to engraft in adult patients, particularly unrelated and mismatched recipients. Determination of a method to expand HSC in cord blood would be a major advance in the field. We have recently identified a hierarchy of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) that circulate in the blood, but also comprise a portion of the endothelial cell intima in human and rhesus macaque blood vessels. Similar to the hematopoietic system, EPC are organized in a hierarchy in which the most proliferative progenitors give rise to numerous progeny with less proliferative potential but greater evidence of maturation with the most mature endothelial cells displaying no proliferative potential. In preliminary studies, human umbilical cord blood was enriched in EPC compared to adult blood. We hypothesize that the frequency and distribution of EPC changes during ontogeny such that the number of circulating cells and EPC residing in vessels decline with age and there is loss of proliferative potential that correlates with telomerase activity. In other preliminary data, we have determined that cord blood EPC co- cultured with human marrow stem cells expands HSC >260 fold compared to freshly isolated marrow HSC. We now hypothesize that EPCwith the highest proliferative potential will better promote HSC expansion than EPC with lower proliferative potential. To test these hypotheses, we proposed the following aims: Specific Aim 1. Determine the role of human cord blood EPC in expanding human cord blood HSC ex vivo. Human cord blood will be co-cultured with EPC ? growth factors and the repopulating ability compared following injection into rhesus fetal hosts in utero. Specific Aim 2. Determine the frequency and proliferative potential of EPC derived from blood and vascular endothelium throughout rhesus ontogeny. Aortic endothelial cells and peripheral blood of rhesus subjects from fetal to aged adults will be examined for EPC content, proliferative potential, and telomerase activity. We hypothesize that EPC proliferative potential declines with age and the rhesus model permits us an opportunity to sample vessels and blood throughout the entire species ontogeny. Specific Aim 3. Determine the role of EPC derived from fetal versus adult blood vessels in the in vitro expansion of fetal rhesus cord blood and adult marrow HSC. We hypothesize that the fetal EPC will more optimally expand fetal than adult HSC but adult HSC will be better expanded on fetal than adult EPC."," ",

young populations. At the rotator cuff, where there are no repair techniques that are immune from recurrent
tears, short to mid term failure rates have been reported to be as high as 94%. Similarly, flexor tendon
insertion site repairs do not heal well. The two key features of the failed healing response are loss of bone
mineral density and lack of fibrocartilage formation at the interface. Therefore,the overall objective of this
study is to use bioengineering approaches to promote bone and fibrocartilage formation in order to
improve the tendon to bone repair.
 Our tissue engineering approach will use the fetal development of tendon to bone insertions as
motivation for promoting a regenerative healing response in our two well established animal models.
Specifically, the expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and bone morphogenetic protein 12
(BMP-12) will be upregulated to promote the formation of bone and fibrocartilage, respectively. BMP-2 has
been implicated in bone fetal development and has successfully been used to promote bone formation in
adult tissues. BMP-12 has been implicated in joint fetal development and has been demonstrated to induce
neo-tendon/fibrocartilage formation when implanted subcutaneously. In this study, autologous mesenchymal
stem cells will be transformed to produce the factors of interest and delivered using a collagen matrix. The
mechanical loading environment has also been implicated in the development and maintenance of bone.
Fetal development and adult healing studies have demonstrated that increased loading results in the
formation of bone, while decreased loading results in the resorption of bone. The role of mechanical loading
during healing will be explored by removing the loading across the repair site in one group and enhancing
the loading across the repair site in a second group.
 In specific aim 1 we will stimulate osteoblasts to produce bone at the healing canine flexor tendon-
bone insertion site through biologic (i.e., BMP-2) and mechanical (i.e., increased loading) means. In specific
aim 2 we will develop biomechanical models to predict the stresses at the tendon to bone interface. In
specific aim 3 we will stimulate repair site cells to produce fibrocartilage at the healing rat supraspinatu
tendon-bone insertion through biologic (i.e., BMP-12) means.
 The long term goal of our research program is to provide therapeutic solutions to the clinical problem
of tendon to bone healing. The candidate's expertise in bioengineering will be combined with the mentors
strengths in clinical science and molecular biology to form a unique and well balanced interdisciplinary team.","126883",

The
synovial lining demonstrates cellular compaction of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and macrophages
within an ordered extracellular matrix. In inflammatory arthritis, this lining exhibits marked hyperplasia and
pannus formation and functionally acquires the ability to migrate over, attach to, and erode into adjacent
cartilage and bone. The major mesenchymal cells of the synovial lining, the FLS, are thought to be
intimately involved in regulating the physiology and architecture of the normal synovial membrane and of
the abnormal synovium in inflammatory arthritis. We found that the cadherin family of proteins, specifically
cadherin-11, is expressed on FLS and is a major factor in their cellular adhesion, migration and invasion
and in formation of the synovial lining. Strikingly, in cadherin-11 deficient mice, the synovial lining is
hypoplastic at baseline and further, the synovium lacks the typical changes seen in inflammatory arthritis.
In cadherin-11 null mice, the inflammatory response in arthritis is attenuated and the synovium does not
attach to or invade cartilage. The specific aims of this proposal are focused on elaborating the role of
cadherin-11 in the production of matrix and synovlocyte proliferation (Aim 1), the capacity of FLS to
migrate, attach to, and erode cartilage (Aim 2) and on their ability to participate in the inflammatory
reaction and interact with macrophages in the synovium in in vitro models (Aim 3). Then, we will
determine if cadherin-11 might serve as a new therapeutic target for inflammatory arthritis in vivo, reducing
both the inflammatory reaction and cartilage damage alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy (Aim
4). Together, these studies will reveal newly identified mechanisms relevant to understanding synovitis as
well as point to potential therapeutic approaches that target FLS in inflammatory arthritis based on the
expression and function of cadherin-11."," ",

develop tissue and respond to growth factors in a significantly different manner compared to normal cells
when grown in monolayer or in three dimensional hydrogel scaffolds. Furthermore, we hypothesize that
when the normal and mutant cells are cocultured in multilayered hydrogel scaffolds, proliferation, tissue
development, and growth factor response will change. The design driven portion of the proposal will develop
a clinically practical strategy for repair of craniofacial defects, in iatrogenic defects and in the disease mouse

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  How does the facial skeleton acquire its characteristic shape? What is the developmental basis of craniofacial birth defects in humans? The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand how epithelia communicate with skeletal precursors to generate precise cellular arrangements of cartilage and bone in the face. Zebrafish is an excellent system to model vertebrate development. This proposal uses strengths of the zebrafish system - powerful forward genetics, the ability to manipulate embryos, and in vivo imaging - to understand the tissue interactions, molecular signalling, and cell biology that specify cartilage shape. Development of the facial skeleton involves an interplay between intrinsic factors that give skeletal precursors a set identity and extrinsic signals from neighboring epithelia. The first aim is to examine how skeletal precursors acquire dorsal identity, and then how this dorsal identity allows them to respond to specific signals from neighboring epithelia. In a newly identified pucker mutant, the dorsal skeleton is transformed to a ventral character, and the expression of ventral dlx genes is expanded dorsally. The cloning and characterization of pucker will provide insights into how the dorsal skeleton is specified and shaped. In the second aim, the identity of the endodermal signals that act on skeletal precursors is investigated. Avian experiments demonstrate a role for endoderm in skeletal patterning, yet it is unclear whether the endoderm signals directly to skeletal precursors at pharyngeal arch stages. Ablation and graft experiments will test that the endoderm directly patterns facial cartilage at arch stages, and gain-of-function studies will test that the endoderm patterns cartilage by secreting distinct combinations of Fgfs and Hhs. In the third aim, the cell biology of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in the face is investigated. Time-lapse imaging will test the model that endodermal epithelia initiate morphology and polarity changes in preskeletal mesenchyme that lead to the formation of cell condensations, a poorly understood developmental intermediate. The role of the endoderm in later cell rearrangements that refine cartilage shape will also be examined. The completion of these aims will further our understanding of facial skeleton development and lead to the better diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of human craniofacial disorders. In addition, the basic developmental knowledge obtained will be essential for the design of cell-based therapies aimed at regenerating the facial skeleton.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions are required during ontogeny for gut morphogenesis and serve a critical role in epithelial carcinogenesis. Epimorphin is a mesenchymal/myofibroblast protein with homology to the syntaxin family of secretory vesicle docking proteins. We generated Epimorphin-/- (Epi-/-) mice, which are viable yet have increased small bowel length, mucosal surface area, crypt cell proliferation and crypt fission. Epi-/- mice were partially protected from acute colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate. Our data suggest that the gut phenotype of the Epi-/- mouse derives from effects on bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp), wnt-¿- catenin and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathways. This is consistent with our observation that aged Epi-/- mice have a significantly increased incidence of small bowel adenomatous polyps, and occasionally develop invasive cancer. The hypotheses are 1. Epimorphin is a stromal inhibitor of epithelial proliferation in the gut, which acts by directly regulating synthesis and/or secretion of Bmps and other myofibroblast growth factors. 2. Epimorphin protects against polyp formation by modulating crypt cell proliferation and fission. 3. Epimorphin deletion predisposes to intestinal polyposis and carcinogenesis by reducing secretion of stromal Bmp and other growth factors, thus modulating wnt-¿-catenin and Hh signaling pathways. 4. Epimorphin deletion enhances colonic epithelial repair by increasing crypt cell proliferation after acute injury. 5. Long term loss of epimorphin will enhance tumor formation in an injury/chronic inflammation cancer model. The Specific Aims are: 1. Determine how epimorphin deletion leads to enhanced crypt cell proliferation and small intestinal polyp formation. 2. Clarify mechanisms by which myofibroblast epimorphin inhibits epithelial proliferation, using myofibroblast-epithelial co-cultures. 3. Determine mechanisms by which epimorphin deletion ameliorates injury induced by DSS, and whether this enhances carcinogenesis associated with DSS-induced injury/inflammation. Significance: we have a unique model of small bowel polyp formation and carcinogenesis, produced by deletion of a single myofibroblast gene. The Epi-/- mouse model has suggested a novel paradigm for the regulation of crypt cell proliferation, crypt fission, and small bowel polyp formation and has provided us with the tools to define the role of myofibroblasts and their secretory products in gut epithelial homeostasis, carcinogenesis and in epithelial injury and repair processes.

indirect consequences ofVitamin D Receptor (VDR) ablation. VDRknockoutmice develophypocalcemia
and secondary hyperparathyroidism which, in turn, leads to hypophosphatemia. They also develop rickets
and osteomalacia. However,when placed on a special diet that maintains normal mineral ion levels, the
VDR null mice have histologically, histomorphometrically and biomechanicallynormal long bones, thus the
skeletal effects of VDR ablation are indirect and are a consequence of impaired VDRaction in the intestine
which results in abnormal mineral ion homeostasis. This observation led us to focus our investigations on
the pathophysiological basis for the development of rickets, which is an indirect consequence ofVDR
ablation. We demonstrated that the growth plate abnormalities in the VDRnull mice are a consequenceof
hypophosphatemia, which leads to expansion ofthe late hypertrophic chondrocyte layer due to impaired
apoptosis ofthese cells. Since hypophosphatemia leads to impaired terminal chondrocytedifferentiation
during postnatal life, studies are proposed to address the hypothesis that phosphate restriction also impairs
chondrocyte differentiation during endochondral skeletal development and skeletal repair. Investigations
will be performed using the ex vivo mouse metatarsal culture system and the in vivo femoral fracture repair
models. These studies will identify developmental pathways that are interrupted byhypophosphatemia, an
indirect consequence ofVDR ablation.
 Analogous to humans with VDRmutations, VDRnull mice have hair perinatally,but develop alopecia.
Hair reconstitution assays and studies in transgenic mice demonstrate that VDRexpression in keratinocytes
is both necessary and sufficient for the prevention of alopecia,thus the effects of the VDRin this cell are
direct. We have also demonstrated that the actions ofthe VDRrequired to prevent alopecia are ligand-
independent, thus reflect novel molecular actions of this nuclear receptor. Investigations in this proposal will
address the hypothesis that the VDRis a key regulator ofthe canonical Wnt signalingpathway in
keratinocyte stem cells and that these ligand-independent actions ofthe VDRare required for cutaneous
homeostasis. The goal of these studies is not to study keratinocytebiologyper se, but rather to use this model
system to characterize the molecularpathway and molecular partners involved in mediating these unique
actions ofthe unliganded VDR. Thus, using the keratinocyte as a model,these studies will identify the novel
molecular actions of the VDRwhich prevent the development of alopecia, a direct consequence ofVDR
ablation.","294871",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Successful treatment of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders is a major unmet clinical need. The objective is to generate functional tissue engineered TMJ articular cartilage for the treatment of TMJ disorders. There are several major technical hurdles that still must be overcome for the development of clinically useful tissue engineered cartilage, including the generation of functional mechanical properties, and availability of an appropriate cell source. Recent studies indicate we have the components necessary to develop a TMJ cartilage with the potential to be used for implantation and TMJ repair. Our objective is to utilize these advances (cell source, bioreactor growth systems, scaffolds) to generate TMJ articular cartilage appropriate for implantation and repair of the TMJ. The overall hypothesis for this project is that proliferated cells, polymer scaffolds with functional tensile properties and bioreactor growth conditions, can be combined to form tissue engineered constructs with functional properties similar to native TMJ articular cartilage. To test this hypothesis and to achieve the stated goal,we have 3 Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Characterize the TMJ mandibular articular cartilage and identify a scaffold that can provide functional tensile properties similar to TMJ articular cartilage, and support cell attachment. Specific Aim 2. Determine the ability of TMJ articular cartilage cells and hMSCs to proliferate, and to maintain or modulate their differentiation to a fibrocartilage phenotype appropriate for synthesis of TMJ articular cartilage. Specific Aim 3: Identify and optimize bioreactor growth conditions for cell-seeded scaffolds to generate constructs similar to native TMJ articular cartilage. The successful outcome of this multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary study has several important critical outcomes to the development of a successful TMJ cartilage repair methodology. Critically, these studies will lead to translational research, where these tissue engineered constructs will be assessed in vivo for their ability to successfully repair TMJ articular cartilage

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanical properties of surfaces or three dimensional matrices on which or in which cells grow have a critical influence on the morphology, transcriptional program, and function of many cell types. Recent studies show that rigidity, as quantified by the elastic modulus, determines the rates of fibroblast motility, the strength with which cells pull on their substrate, and the level of expression of such gene products as specific integrins, isoforms of actin, or class of intermediate filament. Perhaps most significantly, altered rigidity also leads to specific changes in function or preferential growth, such as activation of hepatic stellate cells and astrocytes with increased rigidity, increased neuronal process extension and branching with decreased rigidity, change from normal to abnormal structures in breast epithelia, and the differentiation pathway of mesenchymal stem cells. In some cases the magnitude of the mechanical effect can be modified by other factors such as the type of adhesion receptor involved or the amount and nature of chemical stimuli, but in other cases, the effect of mechanics dominates over chemical signaling, in that soluble stimuli that lead to specific differentiation patterns or to cell activation that are potent for cells on rigid substrates fail to exert their effect when cells are grown on softer materials. The quantitative level of rigidity to which different cell types respond can also differ by at least one order of magnitude, and within the limited data available, the significant stiffness range observed in vitro matches the rigidity of the tissue from which the primary cells derive. The goals of this project are to test the hypothesis that matrix rigidity affects cell function independently of chemical signaling, that cell-type specific mechanical responses can be used to design materials for specific biological uses, and to develop better methods by which to study the effects of material properties on cell structure and function. Effects of extracellular material stiffness may be relevant to disease processes such as fibrosis, and tumor formation in which macroscopic stiffness changes are evident in the pathologic state. The mechanical properties of the materials in which cells grow have a critical influence on the morphology and function of cells. We propose to determine optimal stiffness for specific cell functions and design soft biocompatible materials to support cell growth and function.

Diseases and trauma involving the loss of bony tissue are the most common clinical dental problems, and we propose to develop new polymeric materials for bone tissue engineering. We hypothesize that controlling the nanoscale organization of adhesive ligands presented to transplanted cells from the polymer, as well as the susceptibility of these ligands to cell-mediated rearrangement, will regulate the gene expression of the cells. Alginate will be used as a model matrix system to address the hypothesis guiding this proposal. Cells exhibit little to no adhesion or interaction with alginate, and thus alginate provides an ideal ""blank slate"" on which one can confer specific cellular interaction properties in a controlled manner. Alginate also, in contrast to most model systems, is a practical biomaterial for in vivo application of this work. We specifically aim to: (1) Control the nanoscale presentation of RGD-containing peptides to a model pre-osteoblast cell line and human mesenchymal stem cells, and determine how this regulates focal adhesion formation and cell phenotype, (2) determine if the stiffness of the ligand presenting gels regulates the cells ability to rearrange the adhesion ligands, and (3) determine if these variables allow one to regulate new bone formation in vivo. The time-frame required for the gel, before it degrades, to present this information in order to regulate the cell response and bone formation will also be determined. Successful completion of these aims will have significant impact in both basic and applied sciences, and may eventually lead to improved therapies for regenerating bone defects. Establishing the mechanism by which nanoscale ligand organization and matrix mechanical properties regulate cell phenotype will provide an important new variable for design of biomaterials in tissue engineering and regeneration. The biomaterials developed in this proposal may be directly useful in therapies utilizing precursor cells to regenerate bony tissues in a variety of clinical settings.","346030",

Evidence has been growing that occupational voice users, such as teachers, telephone workers, ministers, counselors, interviewers, are at risk for vocal injury because they get inadequate recovery times from prolonged speaking. The underlying hypothesis is that there is a limited vibration dose that vocal fold tissues can withstand. As for hand-transmitted vibration in power tools use, a safe dose is governed by frequency, amplitude, and duration of vibration exposure. Microphone use solves the overdose problem related to vocal loudness, but does not address the problem of excessive duration. A voice dosimeter has been designed, tested, and is currently in use by teachers in the Denver area public school system to measure vocal dose. The teachers also self-monitor their vocal fatigue levels. In this renewal application, the primary focus will be on the molecular underpinnings of tissue response to excessive vibration. Specific aims are to (1) determine the ideal geometric and viscoelastic properties of the lamina propria, (2) quantify voice recovery times and relate them to auto-perceptive ratings, (3) culture distinct cell types at various states of differentiation, (4) determine the relative merits of co-culture for in vitro monolayer systems, (5) engineer a 3D in vitro model of the lamina propria in a bioreactor, (6) identify and functionally characterize candidate vibration-responsive genes, (7) develop a theoretical model of economic voice production, and (8) explore two types of economy-based vocal therapy. The ultimate goal is to provide heavy voice users with safety criteria based on genetic disposition to vocal injury, degree of training in economic voice use, accumulated dose of vibration in a typical work day, and the amount of recovery available at night and on weekends. A multi-disciplinary research team has been assembled to address this public health concern at physical, biochemical, molecular, and behavioral levels of investigation.","746783",

This has been demonstrated in vitro, within model systems of mesenchymal stem cells, and in vivo when recombinant BMPs have been implanted or injected into ectopic, heterotopic or orthotopic sites. BMPs are also expressed at elevated levels throughout all stages of bone repair and have been shown, when exogenously administered, to enhance the healing response. Hypothesis: BMPs are critical in the regulation of all phases of fracture healing. In order to test this hypothesis, the studies proposed in this application will generate transgenic mice in which a novel experimental strategy is employed
that restricts the expression of a transgene to either cartilage or bone and allows for the exogenous regulation of that transgene through systemic administration of a small molecule. Transgenic animals will be engineered to contain an artificial transcription factor encoded in two proteins, a novel DNA binding domain and an activation domain. The expression of these domains will be driven by a tissue-specific promoter (type II collagen for cartilage or osteocalcin for bone). The transcription factor will be activated by the exogenous administration of a dimerizing agent (rapamycin analog), which brings these domains into proximity. When activated, it will recognize a unique promoter which will drive the overexpression of BMP-2 or antagonize
BMP function by overexpressing Noggin. Using this strategy, transgenic animals will undergo normal embryological development and fractures (or, in the case of Project 1, distraction osteogensis) will be carried out in the presence of normal skeletal function. Only upon introduction of the dimerizing agent will loss or gain of function states be induced through the overexpression of these transgenes. Fracture healing will then be analyzed in specific tissues and at specific times under conditions in which BMP function is altered. These studies will provide extensive new data concerning the specific roles that BMPs play at critical stages
of fracture healing and establish a powerful model system for investigating a wide array of molecules and their effects on skeletal function."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers (REMC) will aim to transform our understanding of human epigenetics through production and integrative analysis of comprehensive reference epigenomes for ES cells, differentiated cells and tissues. In pursuit of this goal, we have assembled a unique scientific team and infrastructure with broad expertise and capabilities in stem cell biology, epigenomics, technology, production research and computation. We recently demonstrated two complementary methods that leverage ultra high-throughput sequencing for epigenomic analysis. In the first method, genome-wide chromatin maps are acquired by deep sequencing chromatin IP DNA (ChlP-Seq). In the second, nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps are generated by high-throughput bisulfite-sequencing (HTBS). These methods represent major improvements over prior tools as they yield precise digital information, have high genome coverage, require fewer cells and are cost-effective. Multiple epigenomic maps have already been produced for stem cells and primary tissues, and pipelines have been assembled for efficient data collection, processing and analysis. For the REMC project, we propose to apply ChlP-Seq and HTBS pipelines to generate comprehensive high-resolution maps of chromatin state and DNA methylation for 100 diverse cell types. Cell types were selected for their biological and medical importance, and for their potential to maximize the comprehensiveness of acquired epigenomic data. They include human ES cells, ES-derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells, reprogrammed stem cells and primary tissues. ChlP-Seq will be used to map highly informative chromatin modifications and related chromatin proteins in each cell type. HTBS will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps. Reference epigenomes will reveal the locations and activation states of diverse functional genomic elements, inform on the developmental state and potential of studied cell populations, and provide a framework for understanding complex epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. All data will be made available to the scientific community upon verification. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive characterization of epigenetic marks ('the epigenome') is a critical step towards a global understanding of the human genome in health and disease. The proposed mapping studies will provide unprecedented views of the human epigenetic landscape and its variation across cell states, offer fundamental insight into the functions and interrelationships of epigenetic marks, and provide a framework for future studies of normal and diseased epigenomes.

nonhematopoietic cell types; these including hepatocytes, endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, skin and
gastrointestinal epithelium in humans. We have recently demonstrated the engraftment of endometrial
stroma and epithelium with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in women who had
undergone bone marrow transplantation. The ability of bone marrow-derived stem cells to generate
endometrium may contribute to the regenerative capacity of the uterus, and may also have clinical
implications in the establishment of pregnancy, the failure of uterine ablative procedures or therapeutic
augmentation of stem cell transdifferentiation to endometrium. The ability of bone marrow-derived stem
cells to become uterine cells suggests an alternative hypothesis for the origin of endometriosis. We
present preliminary data that bone marrow-derived stem cells can engraft the human uterus, that nonuterine
stem cells engraft the mouse uterus. These cells are indistinguishable from endometrial stromal
or glandular epithelial cells and express appropriate markers of endometrial differentiation.
We hypothesize that bone marrow-derived stem cells engraft the uterus and can alter uterine function
including the ability to conceive. We will test this hypothesis and characterize this process in three
specific aims. Specific Aim one will fully characterize the ability of bone marrow cells to engraft the
uterus though the use of male to female GFP+ bone marrow transplantation. Specific Aim two will
determine the mechanisms that recruit bone marrow-derived stem cells to the endometrium. Specific
Aim three will characterize the functional significance of bone marrow engraftment through rescue of
mice with targeted disruption of genes required for implantation; in this aim we will also test the ability of
bone marrow-derived stem cells to contribute to the pathophysiology of endometriosis.
Stem cells of bone marrow origin have a remarkable ability to transdifferentiate. We will determine the
extent to which this process occurs in the uterus, the mechanisms that drive stem cell recruitment, and
the significance of this engraftment in the function of this tissue in pregnancy and disease. These
findings are expected to produce novel paradigms of endometrial regeneration with clinically important
ramifications."," ",

(1)  Development and application of electrospun nanofibrous scaffold for tissue engineering:
-  improved cell seeding, application of growth factors, and the use of dynamic bioreactor for efficient cartilage formation
-  formation of aligned nanofibrous scaffold for mesenchymal stem cell-based engineering of meniscus-like tissue construct
-  successful repair of osteochondral defect using MSC-nanofibrous composite as well as autologous chondrocyte-loaded biomarterial
-  amalgam of nanofibrous scaffold and hyaluronan hydrogel for the engineering of biphasic, intervertebral disc-like constructs

(2)  Tissue engineering of tendon/ligament using mesenchymal stem cell-loaded collagen gel under static tension

(3)  Characterization of physical loading and growth factor effects on chondrocyte and MSC-based cartilage constructs

(4)  Application of biomaterials for controlled release and delivery of bioactive factors and genetic materials to promote cell differentiation and tissue formation

(5)  Analysis of Physical Influences on Skeletal Biology.  Skeletal tissues are uniquely adapted to responding to mechanical influences. We are currently designing mechanoactive bioreactor systems to apply both dynamic and static mechanical stimulation based on hydrostatic and compressive loading, and using mesenchymal stem cell-based tissue constructs to analyze the cellular and molecular basis of the biological responses. By varying the nature of the biomaterial scaffold, the mixture of cell types, and the growth factor treatment, we aim to decipher the crosstalk among various signal transduction pathways.  More importantly, we are examining the interaction between different cell types, e.g., chondrocytes and endothelial cells, under mechanoactive environment.  We are also applying a mechanoactive bioreactor system for tendon/ligament tissue engineering. 

The novel technologies developed in this project have significant application potential for the repair and regeneration of injured and diseased skeletal tissues, in diseases such as osteoarthritis, degenerative disc diseases, tendon rupture, and meniscal tear. In the case of osteoarthritis, we have made substantial progress demonstrating the utility of mesenchymal stem cell-seeded nanofibrous construct in repair an a critical size osteochondral defect in a large animal (pig) model.   We are planning a study on the repair of cartilage defects produced by supraphysiological impact, which simulates traumatic osteoarthritis, using similar cell-biomaterial constructs.  Similarly, we are excited about the potential utility of the intervertebral disc construct produced using the nanofiber-hydrogel amalgam approach, and will plan a small animal study to evaluate its functionality to repair lacerated intervertebral disc.  Overall, we believe that Information gathered from this project should lead to a rational basis to functional skeletal tissue engineering and its application to skeletal diseases of significant burden, including osteoarthritis, degenerative disc diseases, and other soft tissue injuries.","1579264",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this researches to design strategies for cartilage repair. Specifically, we will create novel materials derived from glucosamine and determine the mechanism of glucosamine action on chondrocytes and bone marrow derived stem cells. Glucosamine has had a long history in clinical treatment of cartilage degeneration. Unfortunately there has been conflicting validation of efficacy in vitro and little understanding of glucosamine's mechanism of action. Some researchers have hypothesized that glucosamine functions to directly increase cartilage polysaccharide synthesis. The expertise of a glycobiologist is critical to finally understanding glucosamine activity on cartilage. Our preliminary data and coPI expertise demonstrates that glucosamine functions by O-Glc-NAc protein modification which in turn regulates numerous cell activities to increase matrix production. We have also demonstrated increased cartilage extracellular matrix deposition in hydrogels when engineering cartilage from chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the presence of glucosamine. Results of this study will allow us to definitively provide the mechanism of glucosamine action on cartilage growth and design appropriate repair strategies. This proposal is both hypothesis driven and design driven. We hypothesize that glucosamine enters the metabolic hexosamine pathway in cells that supports O-GlcNAc-mediated cell responses to improve new cartilage formation instead of being directly incorporated into glycosaminoglycan synthesis as previously hypothesized by researchers. In the design portion of the proposal we will investigate chondrocyte and MSC response to glucosamine in hydrogel tissue engineering systems. Furthermore, we will develop novel materials derived from glucosamine so that the molecule can be readily released from a biomaterial scaffold for in vivo delivery. The following specific aims will address these research topics. Specific aim 1. Evaluate glucosamine activity on cartilage tissue engineering 1A: Determine glucosamine influence on cartilage tissue formation by chondrocytes and MSCs. 1B: Identify specific biochemical pathways responsible for cellular responses to glucosamine. Specific aim 2. Synthesize a polymeric glucosamine for incorporation into 3D scaffolds for cartilage engineering. .

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanistic aspects of cellular responses to L1 activity, to evaluate L1 -induced mutagenesis and its contribution to DNA damage and associated aging, to determine whether this contribution increases with age, and to find out potential variation of this contribution among individuals. These goals are important because the existing data indicate that the DNA damage in the form of double-strand breaks (DSBs) inflicted by the L1-encoded DNA endonuclease is potentially much greater than the insult to the genome caused by the element via insertional mutagenesis. We detected endogenous L1 expression in a number of somatic cells. Therefore this type of DNA damage has consequences for the whole organism, not only for its progeny. We also wish to address the L1 contribution to the DNA damage and associated aging in human stem cells. For these studies we will manipulate L1 expression levels and correlate L1 activity with the resulting DNA damage by western blot analysis, g-H2AX foci staining, and COMET assays in normal cell lines. We will use reporter assay to quantify the mutagenic potential of L1 elements. We will use cultured primary cell models to determine L1 potential to accelerate cellular senescence in somatic and stem cells. Reported ability of L1 elements to inflict DNA damage and its endogenous expression in a number of human tissues fundamentally changes our understanding of the significance of the L1 expression and its impact on the health of the host. This project is designed to determine whether ongoing low levels of L1 expression in somatic and stem cells lead to a steady accumulation of mutations due to the error-prone repair of the DSBs created by the L1 endonuclease. The direct health implication of this discovery would be L1 contribution to mammalian aging and/or age- associated diseases such as cancer. Due to the constant improvement of the health care there is a growing population of older people that is more susceptible to age-associated diseases. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms of aging would contribute to our potential to prevent the onset of aging or age- associated diseases.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of this research is to develop tissue engineering strategies for the understanding and treatment of craniofacial abnormalities. This proposal is both hypothesis and design driven. We will investigate tissue development of cells from mouse models of the craniofacial abnormality Apert syndrome. We hypothesize that mutant cells from the FGFR2 knock-in Apert mouse model developed by the co-Pi will develop tissue and respond to growth factors in a significantly different manner compared to normal cells when grown in monolayer or in three dimensional (3D) hydrogel scaffolds. Furthermore, we hypothesize that when the normal and mutant cells are cocultured in multilayered hydrogel scaffolds, proliferation, tissue development, and growth factor response will change. The design driven portion of the proposal will develop a clinically practical strategy for repair of craniofacial defects, in iatrogenic defects and in the disease mouse model, using cell encapsulation technologies developed by the lab. To test these hypotheses and design the repair system the following specific aims will be investigated: Specific aim 1. Investigate cell behavior and tissue development of cells isolated from FGFR2 knock-in mouse model of Apert Syndrome. Specifically this aim will address 1.) chondrogenesis and osteogenesis of cells from a Fgfr2+/S252W mouse model of Apert Syndrome, compared to cells from normal siblings and an immortalized, clonal mouse mesenchymal stem cell line. Cells from a.) the long bone and b.) the cranium will be evaluated in 2D monolayer and 3D hydrogel scaffolds in vitro. Specific aim 2. Investigate cell behavior and tissue development of mutant and normal cells in response to growth factors and co-culture. Specifically this aim will address 1.) response of mutant and normal cells to musculoskeletal-related growth factors in 2D and 3D hydrogel culture, and 2.) apply a novel 3D bilayered hydrogel system to coculture normal and mutant cells to determine the effects of coculture on cell behavior and tissue development of normal and mutant cells. Specific aim 3. Determine in vivo function of mutant and normal cells in craniofacial models. Specifically, tissue development in 1.) iatrogenic mouse cranial defects and 2.) congenital defects in Apert Syndrome will be evaluated using cells embedded in hydrogels. Normal and mutant mouse cell lines will be used in addition to a clonally-derived mouse mesenchymal stem cell line. Tissue development will be assessed by radiographic and histological analyses.

The long-term goal of this proposal is to expand and study our colony of nonhuman primates affected with Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy (GLD; Krabbe's disease). This colony of rhesus monkeys represents the only colony of nonhuman primates in the world in which an inherited lysosomal disorder has been recognized, propagated, and is available for study.  The primary focus of this R24 grant is to markedly improving the efficiency of producing macaques affected with GLD through a stringent natural breeding program.  There are 12 established harem breeding groups containing a carrier male and a combination of carrier and normal females. These social groups have been created based on pedigree data from the carrier colony as well as the availability of normal females who could be placed with carrier males.  Chorionic villi sampling was performed for prenatal diagnosis.  Of the eleven known pregnancies, there were 9 live births (2 affected, 3 carrier, 4 normal) and 2 stillbirths (carriers). We continue to characterize disease pathogenesis and generate a database with the affected animals through molecular, biochemical, clinical, behavioral, and pathologic analyses to develop an extensive baseline of knowledge of disease progression in the nonhuman primate model.  One of the 2007 affected infants died at 100 days of age while the other infant is 132 days old and data continues to be collected.  As an effective alternative to whole animal studies, we have initiated a cell and tissue banking program for the GLD animals. The primary goal for this program is to make viable cells (peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and skin fibroblasts) and tissue samples (primary organ systems) available to investigators for their research.  As of December 2007, there are 39 heterozygous (carrier) animals: 25 breeding age animals (14 males and 11 females), 7 juveniles (3 males and 4 females), and 7 infants/yearlings (5 males, 2 females).

Hyperplasia is a major contributor to the increase in adipose tissue mass during the development of obesity. However, the identity and characteristics of precursor cells that are destined for the adipocyte lineage remains unclear. Stem cell antigen 1 (Sca-1) has been used recently as a candidate marker to identify tissue-resident stem cells.  Our previous studies showing that ear mesenchymal stem cells (EMSC) positive for Sca-1 have an enhanced capacity for differentiation into adipocytes suggests that Sca-1 is a biomarker for adipocyte lineage. In the present study, we have extended our earlier findings by exploring the potential use of the surface antigen, Sca-1, as a selectable marker for adipocyte progenitors. We have confirmed that Sca-1 positive, but not Sca-1 negative EMSC, showed a robust accumulation of lipid droplets during adipogenic differentiation. Comparative analysis of the adipogenic differentiation process between Sca-1 enriched and Sca-1 depleted population of EMSC revealed substantial differences in the adipogenic genes that were expressed at significantly higher levels in Sca-1 enriched EMSC fraction. However the most striking observation was that leptin was detected only in the conditioned media of Sca-1 enriched EMSC. No leptin protein was detected in the Sca-1 depleted population, consistent with the level of leptin mRNA, indicating a critical role for Sca 1 in mechanism of energy balance.  
Additionally during the past year we characterized the immunophenotype of stromal-vascular fraction of cells from epidydymal and inguinal fat depot. Flow cytometry analysis showed that cells from both depots express very high levels of Sca-1marker (80%). For our future experiments we will utilize two established animal models, Rosa26 and Sca1 KO, to evaluate the role of Sca1 in supporting adipogenesis. Moreover, to estimate the potential differences in localization and quantity of adipose-derived stem cells we have developed a cell labeling methodology (BrdU) to follow Sca1 positive cells in fat tissues to evaluate the long term contribution of Sca-1 to the expansion of the fat mass under obesogenic conditions.  The significance of this proposal lies in its contribution to our understanding of mechanisms that determine the process by which recruitment of adipocyte progenitor cells contributes to adipose tissue expansion, a fundamental process in obesity.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad long-term objective of the proposed research is to investigate the potential efficacy and safety of new cell based therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH). The disorder is a serious life threatening disease characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial pressure, right heart failure and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Pharmacologic therapy can improve survival and quality of life. However, the long term outcome is not favorable. Gene therapy has a beneficial effect in experimental models of PH. However, the use of viral and nonviral vectors has led to low level gene transfer, random expression and adverse effects such as an inflammatory response that limits the clinical utility of this approach. Another approach for the treatment of PH is the use of cell based therapy. It is our hypothesis that wild type (unmodified) and gene modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will have a beneficial effect in experimental models of PH. This hypothesis was tested in rats with monocrotaline induced PH using well-characterized expanded MSCs. The results of this recently published study show that intratracheal administration of unmodified rat MSCs 2 weeks after monocrotaline administration attenuates monocrotaline induced PH and improves endothelium dependent responses 5 weeks after the administration of the plant alkaloid. These data provide proof of concept and are the basis of this application on lung stem cell biology and cell based therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. The overall objective of the proposed research is to investigate the potential efficacy and safety of MSC therapy in experimental PH. The first specific aim is to investigate the effect of unmodified and gene modified MSCs on pulmonary arterial and wedge pressure and cardiac output and on pulmonary vasodilator response to acetylcholine for periods up to 6 months after moncrotaline administration. These studies will provide information on efficacy and safety of the cell based therapy. The second specific aim is to investigate the fate of intratracheally injected MSCs in the lung for periods up to 6 months. These studies will examine the localization and phenotype of transplanted MSCs and the potential to induce tumor formation in the lung using light microscopy and immunohistochemical techniques.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Skeletal patterning begins during embryogenesis when mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) condensate into elements that prefigure the future bone. Formation of the embryologic skeleton proceeds through a complex process of both endochondral and intramembranous ossification. During intramembranous ossification and postnatal skeletal formation, the mesenchyamal stem cells give rise to osteoblasts, which synthesize the matrix constituents on bone forming surfaces. Following the initial commitment to the osteoblast lineage, the osteoprogenitor cells continues to proliferate and proceed through a series of developmental stages that culminate in the generation of the mature osteoblast that is responsible for synthesizing extracellular matrix. Proliferation, differentiation and bone remodeling activities of osteoblasts involve a complex temporal network of growth factors, signaling proteins, and transcription factors, of which many have yet to be identified. The broad objectives of this project are to expand our understanding of the transcriptional and signaling mechanisms that govern the differentiation and activation of osteoblasts during skeletal formation and remodeling. The candidate's proposal focuses on the regulation of WWP1 in osteoblast biology by building upon the candidates recent finding that identified the zinc-finger adapter protein Schnurri-3 (Shn3) as an essential regulator of osteoblast synthetic acitivity through its interaction with WWP1. The candidate has taken an unbiased approach to identify novel regulators of osteoblast differentiation from mesechymal stem cells. Conducting the mentored phase of the project in the laboratory of Dr. Laurie Glimcher will provide an ideal environment to develop the foundation necessary for continuing to research the molecular events that govern the process of bone remodeling during the independent phase in the candidates own academic lab. Relevance: Functional deregulation of osteoblasts affects bone mass and contributes to the pathogenesis of skeletal disorders, including osteoporosis, erosive arthritis and primary and metastatic bone malignancies. As the population in the United States ages, the incidence of these diseases will increase and present an expanding source of morbidity and mortality. A complete molecular understanding of osteoblast biology will provide for better therapeutic targets to help protect and possibly restore those tissue that have been compromised during the these various skeletal disorders.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) based bone tissue engineering has become a potential alternative approach for craniofacial skeletal defect repair. Bone regeneration and integration are influenced both by properties of tissue-engineered constructs and pathophysiological environments of implantation sites. For practical clinical application, a stimulus to improve effectively the differentiation potentials of MSCs is demanded. Current positive outcomes of bone tissue engineering have been established utilizing young and healthy hosts. The influence of pathophysiological conditions such as osteoporosis on bone formation and integration of engineered bone is still elusive. Estrogen has been known to inhibite bone resorption and increase bone formation. It was found recently that estrogen can improve osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow MSCs. We hypothesize that estrogen can be employed to up-regulate osteogenic potential of MSCs for optimizing tissue-engineered constructs in vitro and to improve bone formation and osteo-integration in vivo. The overall objective of this project is to optimize estrogen modulation of tissue-engineered constructs and investigate bone formation of optimized constructs at different host environments. Effects of estrogen of various concentrations will be assessed for differentiation of MSCs-based constructs in vitro (Aim 1) and bone formation in vivo (Aim 2). Bone regeneration and integration of optimized constructs will be evaluated in femur bone defects in hosts with different estrogen levels (Aim 3). This project will provide important information for clinical applications of bone tissue engineering. The obtained data during this R03 grant will be included in to an R01 application striving to optimize the properties of MSCs-based constructs and pathophysiological environments for skeletal tissue engineering. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page Continuation Format Page This project will provide crucial information of estrogen on bone tissue engineering for clinical application. The current project is to explore estrogen as a modulator to improve mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based bone formation. We will investigate estradiol to modulate MSCs-based tissue engineered constructs in vitro and to improve the bone formation and osteo-integration in osteoporotic environments.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mammalian tooth germ provides a powerful system for studying the epithelial-mesenchymal tissue interactions that underlie organogenesis. In the prior grant, we investigated the function of the Msx1 homeobox gene in mouse molar tooth development, and identified components of the genetic pathway involved. We found that BMP4 effects a highly specific and nearly complete rescue of Msx1 mutant molar tooth development, which otherwise arrests at the bud stage. Thus, BMP4 is a key downstream effector of Msx1 function in the dental mesenchyme during odontogenesis. In addition, Msx1 is required to integrate the mesenchymal response to different epithelially-derived inductive signals such as BMPs and FGFs that act on the dental mesenchyme. Msx1 also executes a later function in odontoblast survival, and its homolog Msx2 plays an essential role in enamel organ development. Nonetheless, the precise molecular function of Msx1 during early tooth development remains unsolved. For example, although candidates exist, there are no proven direct molecular regulators of Msx1 expression in the dental mesenchyme, nor are there direct downstream targets in the dental mesenchyme that are regulated by Msx 1. 

This competing continuation will address this gap in our knowledge. Tooth development in both Msx1 and Pax9 knockout mice arrests at the bud-stage, and both genes are expressed in a hierarchical manner in dental mesenchyme. These data suggest a close molecular relationship between Pax9, Msx1 and other components of the early odontogenic hierarchy. This competing renewal proposes three Specific Aims to clarify this relationship and to identify new regulators that act at the bud stage of tooth development. First, we will use transcriptional profiling and bioinformatic approaches to identify genes whose expression is deregulated in Msx1 and Pax9 mutant dental mesenchyme. Second, we will use the information from Aim I along with experimental approaches to identify transcription factors that directly regulate Msx1 expression in the dental mesenchyme. Third, we will clarify the mechanism by which Msx1 acts in bud stage dental mesenchyme by identifying Msx1-interacting proteins and by testing their ability to co-regulate presumptive Msx1 target genes, some inferred from Aim 1. Collectively, these experiments should define the early odontogenic regulatory hierarchy in both genetic and molecular terms, clarify the relationship between two key regulators of early odontogenesis, Pax9 and Msx1, am enhance our general understanding of odontogenesis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The regulation of cadherin-mediated adhesion underlies many morphogenetic processes. Understanding cadherin regulation in embryos has important implications for many developmental diseases, including birth defects, and it will be important for advances in regenerative medicine. The regulation of cadherins also occurs in adult tissues and is involved in many pathophysiological processes including alterations in epithelial transport, inflammation, and vascular remodeling. In particular, downregulation of E-cadherin function or remodeling of adherens junction during the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to tumor metastasis, and the ability to slow this process could provide approaches for cancer therapy. Much has been learned in recent years about the cellular processes (eg. membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, protein turnover) and signaling pathways that impact on cadherin-mediated adhesion and adherens junction remodeling. In a different area of investigation, a great deal has been learned about the molecular structure of the cadherin homophilic bond. The goals of this proposed project are to bridge the gap between these two areas and elucidate how regulation of adhesion by these various cellular processes and growth factor signaling pathways controls the structure and activity state of the cadherin adhesive bond. Novel tools that will be key to this project are cadherin activating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and conformation selective mAbs for different cadherin structural and functional states. The specific aims are: A. Analyze the relationship between the activity state of the E-cadherin at the cell surface and E-cadherin internalization, adherens junction remodeling or disassembly during the epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), and the growth and spread of human epithelial tumor cells; B. Determine how Paraxial Protocadherin (PAPC) regulates C-cadherin- mediated cell adhesion and cell sorting in the early Xenopus embryo; C. Explore cadherin conformations and three-dimensional structures associated with functional states, including dimerization and activity state, as defined by conformation selective and activating mAbs; D. Analyze cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling cadherin activity states at the cell surface in response to activating monoclonal antibodies and growth factor signaling; using high resolution fluorescence imaging, a structure-function analysis of the cadherin-catenin complex, and the identification of cadherin interacting proteins specifically associated with activity state. An important hypothesis to be tested is that inside-out regulation of the activity state of cadherins at the cell surface participates in many of the cellular events associated with adherens junction remodeling and cadherin downregulation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cadherins are cell adhesion proteins, which function to hold cells together in tissues and organs, and cadherin dysfunction can lead to development defects in embryos as well as tumor growth and metastasis in adults. We are trying to understand the way that cadherin protein molecules are switched on and off at the surface of the cell to control their adhesive functions in tissues. Moreover, we are developing methods to detect and control the functional state of cadherins on the cell, which have the potential to be used as diagnostic or therapeutic approaches for the treatment of many diseases, including cancer.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop a protein-based molecular prediction strategy using nanoparticle quantum dots (QDs) to aid in the accurate diagnosis of lymph node metastasis (LNM) from primary tumor (PT). It is an appropriate application for Exploratory Studies in Cancer Detection, Diagnosis, and Prognosis (PA-06-299). There are two questions that will be addressed in this project. First, we would like to determine whether protein-based biomarkers that relate to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) can be used to identify a subpopulation of tumor cells with high risk for metastasis in PTs. Second, we will address whether the utilization of QD technology for simultaneous detection of multi-biomarkers can facilitate the accurate prediction of LNM from SCCHN PTs. Although the concept of preexisting metastatic cells in PTs has been proposed for many years, these cells have not been clearly identified in human tissues. Since the expression of protein is more relevant than gene expression to the biological behavior of tumor cells, using multi-proteins expressed in PTs as biomarkers to predict LNM may not only achieve more reliable data, but also help in understanding the biology of metastasis. A recent development of QD-based imaging can simultaneously detect and quantify multi-proteins, providing a unique tool for this study. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that there is a subpopulation of tumor cells in PTs carrying metastatic signatures, such as dedifferentiation or EMT, which represents the major population of LNM. Using QD-based technology, we will detect this sub-population, which will facilitate both prediction of LNM from the PT and understanding the biology of metastasis. Two specific aims will test this hypothesis: (1) To develop QD linked multi-antibodies (QD-Abs) for detection and quantification of multi-biomarkers using SCCHN tissue samples: Based on current literature and our preliminary data from the animal model and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies, this Specific Aim will initially select 5 metastasis-related biomarkers, including E-cadherin, ¿-catenin, dysadherin, EGFR, and integrin ¿1, and conjugate their antibodies with QDs. The QD-Abs will be validated by comparison with conventional IHC. The same 100 PT SCCHN tissue samples (50 LNM-positive and 50 LNM-negative PTs) as used in the preliminary studies will serve as our ""training"" set. The 3-5 best-comparable biomarkers will be identified and selected for further studies in Specific Aim 2. (2) To validate QD-Abs for detection and quantification of selected biomarkers in human primary SCCHN tissues and correlate these with metastasis and survival of SCCHN patients: An additional 200 samples selected using similar criteria to the training set will be used as our ""testing"" samples for validation of the established QD-Abs system. We will try to identify and quantify a subpopulation of the PT cells as high-risk for metastasis and correlate this subpopulation with LNM and survival of the SCCHN patients.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reliable detection of LNM is paramount for appropriate treatment planning. This project aims to develop nanoparticle quantum dots (QDs) technology to detect multi-biomarkers as a prediction strategy to aid in the accurate diagnosis of LNM from the primary tumor. Based on data generated from this project, a novel strategy of QD-based protein detection will be further developed that can be used in both the clinic and in research laboratories.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advances in Mineral Metabolism (AIMM) is an annual meeting which combines presentations on basic and clinical bone biology in a format that provides extensive opportunity for open discussion. The AIMM meeting has been embraced by a broad spectrum of bone biologists and clinicians who have gathered annually for over 20 years to participate in the high quality discussions of bone and mineral metabolism which embody the spirit of AIMM. One of the major goals of the AIMM meeting is to provide opportunities for young scientists to interact closely with more established researchers in a non-intimidating, intimate, and interactive venue that fosters creative scientific exchange. This is accomplished through a number of mechanisms: first, the AIMM/ASBMR John Haddad young investigator awards are presented at the AIMM meeting and awardees discuss their work within the planned scientific sessions; second, the program includes an open basic science session and an open clinical science session in which young investigators are encouraged to present recent findings; third, each session includes a lengthy question-answer period where participation of young investigators is prominent; fourth, the recently introduced meet-the-professor sessions provide unique opportunities for small-group interaction that particularly benefit scientists-in-training and young faculty. Finally, the format of the meeting where attendees are together most of the time and that includes a long midday break for informal discussions has been shown to be a successful way to increase interaction. For the 2008 AIMM meeting, young faculty members and trainees represent over 60% of selected speakers. The 2008 AIMM meeting will include sessions on cell fate determination; in vivo analysis of the marrow mesenchymal lineage and the interaction with hematopoiesis; the bone-kidney axis; genetics of bone disease; treatment-induced bone loss; novel paracrine and coupling factors; and epigenetics of bone and cartilage. The purpose of this proposal is to request funds to help defray the costs of the meeting and support registration and travel costs for young investigators and junior faculty (other than Haddad awardees) that attend the meeting. These funds will aid immensely in allowing AIMM to fulfill its function to stimulate further creativity in bone and cartilage research and to provide young investigators with a tribune to promote their talent. Advances in Mineral Metabolism (AIMM) strives to:  Act as a premier forum for clinical and basic research into the calcified tissues;  Facilitate and encourage interactions between scientists working in the area of calcified tissue research;  Provide opportunities for young scientists to interact closely with more established researchers;  Hold highly interactive scientific meetings, and so disseminate and exchange results from studies and research (Participation to the meeting provides continuing medical education credits).

Global assessment of molecular changes in these models have led to identification of key gene functions implicated in human prostate cancer and its metastases. Two such functions are the focus of this proposal. These molecules, both secretory and commonly referred to as bone matrix proteins, are: osteopontin (OPN), an RGD-containing glycosylated phosphoprotein, and osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1 or BMP-7), a member of the TGF-p superfamily. Since prostate cancer has the propensity to metastasize to bone and to induce bone lesions, and both of these proteins are believed to be involved, in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation, these molecules constitute an important, but yet an understudied area of research in the biology of prostate cancer. In preliminary experiments we find that OPN expression, prominent in prostatic preneoplastic lesions of a mouse model, continues to increase with progression to invasive adenocarcinoma, and cells overexpressing OPN are enriched in the metastatic deposits. Additional data collected to date indicate that OPN upregulation may be a factor in proliferation, motility, invasion, and most remarkably in the ability of the human prostate cancer cells to intravasate blood vessels. We find that BMP-7 expression continues to increase with the growth of the prostate cancer in our mouse model, it can modulate growth, motility and invasion properties of human prostatic epithelial cells, and it can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition to a prostate cancer cell line. We implicate BMP receptor signaling differences with the observed differential biological responses induced. The stated goals of this application are two-fold. First to refine our metastatic prostate cancer model by incorporating the capability of either to monitor the tumor growth and site-specific metastases by in vivo bioluminescense, or to isolate cancer cells from primary tumor and organspecific metastases. Second is to define the molecular/cellular parameters by which OPN or BMP-7 may positively influence prostate cancer progression and metastases. A series of interconnected and parallel studies using the mouse model and cancer cells derived from it, human prostate cancer cell lines, and osteoblasts and precursors are outlined to obtain insight into how OPN and BMP-7 may contribute to prostate cancer progression and to the mechanism of prostate cancer-mediated osteogenesis.","305244",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In this proposal, we seek to understand the role of exogenously derived CD45+ hematopoeitic cells in the development of the lung's innate immune system, and in the maturation of the pulmonary vasculature. Notably, our data show that the embryonic lung contains 2 anatomically distinct sets of CD45+ cells. One CD45+ population localized to the mesenchyme, contains cells of early and late macrophage/myeloid lineage. This finding along with data showing that mature macrophages emerge in isolated embryonic lung cultures exposed to LPS, suggest that the embryonic lung itself is a site of myeloid differentiation. The other CD45+ population is most apparent in late fetal life (E18), aggregated around branches of the pulmonary artery. Many of these cells co-express smooth muscle actin, are flattened, and appear to be in various stages of incorporation into the vessel wall; further work suggests that notch-3 dependent signaling controls their fate. Herein, we propose the following central hypothesis: one fetal CD45+ population locally differentiates in response to mesenchyme-derived signals to help establish the lung's innate immune system, whereas the second peri-vascular CD45+ population directly contributes to maturation of the pulmonary artery wall. In Aim 1, we will focus on the CD45+ mesenchymal site. Our studies will clarify the ontogeny of myeloid cell maturation and identify lung parenchymal cells that produce signals stimulating macrophage and dendritic cell differentiation. Using lung embryonic cultures, we will then define the precise regions of macrophage and dendritic cell differentiation, and evaluate the role of the lung epithelium in these events. In Aim 2 we will focus on the peri-vascular CD45+ cells. We will further define their phenotype, evaluate their distribution in other embryonic tissues, and determine the importance of PU1 dependent myeloid cell differentiation for their development. In the final set of studies, we will focus on the role of notch-3 in cell fate determination and identify the functionally relevant ligand-notch-3 binding interaction that is operative in this cell population. Through this work, we will clarify how interactions between the developing lung and the hematopoeitic system ensure that the newly born lung is ready for air-breathing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Currently, there is little or no information regarding how cells derived from the fetal circulation contribute to lung development. Our studies suggest that such cells are not only involved in establishment of the lung's immune system, but are also involved in development of the lung's blood vessels. This work will, thus, fill in major gaps in knowledge and should foster a new developmental paradigm for understanding how the embryonic lung becomes equipped air breathing. Elucidating these developmental processes is critical for advancing the treatment of congenital lung diseases, and the specific lung diseases that afflict premature infants.

Our ongoing
studies indicate that the synthesis of LN-2 is mechano-sensitive. In recent studies we identified a new set of
stretch- referred to as Tension Induced/Inhibited Proteins (TIPs). One of them, TIP-1, is induced by stretch
 and promotes smooth muscle (SM) myogenesis. Our preliminary data indicate that TIP-1 expression in lung
 embryonic mesenchymal cells is induced by LN-2. Preliminary data also suggest that TIP-1 upregulates the
level of the GTPase Cdc42 and that Cdc42 stimulates SM myogenesis. Based on this we hypothesize that
LN-2 regulates myogenesis by a signaling pathway that involves TIP-1, depends on mechanical stimuli and
engages Cdc42 as a downstream effector. To test this hypothesis we propose three aims: Aim #1 - to
determine the role of Cdc42 in lung myogenesis. Aim #2 - To determine whether LN-2 mediated bronchial
myogenesis involves TIP-1. This aim will have two subaims: A. Effect of LN-2 on TIP-1 expression. B.
Effect of blocking TIP-1 on LN-2-mediated SM myogenesis. Aim #3 - to determine whether Cdc42 acts
downstream of TIP-1 in LN-2/TIP-1 stimulation of bronchial myogenesis. This aim will have two subaims:
A. Effect of LN-2 and TIP-1 on Cdc42 expression. B. Effect of blocking Cdc42 on LN-2/TIP-1-mediated
 myogenesis. To address these aims we will use cell and organ cultures plus functional probes to stimulate or
inhibit Cdc42, LN-2 and TIP-1 level/activity. Among the probes we will use purified LN-2, LN-2, Cdc42
and TIP-1 expression constructs and LN-2, Cdc42 and TIP-1 RNA interference constructs. Occurrence of
 myogenesis will be determined by a series of SM markers and by visualization of the entire bronchial tree in
whole lung explants after immunostaining for SM a-actin. The proposed studies will unravel a previously
unexplored molecular mechanism whereby tension-induced LN-2 and TIP-1 contribute to the development
 of lung bronchial muscle. We anticipate, therefore that this project will advance our understanding of lung
development as well as diseases caused by, or resulting from abnormal SM quantity, distribution and
 function.","210000",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  During development, certain genes are activated to stimulate cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and neovascularization.  These genes are often downregulated once organ development is complete.  During carcinogenesis, the same genes are often re-activated, stimulating the same properties, but now out of context.  Transcribed by one such gene, the homeobox protein and transcription factor Six1 is expressed during embryogenesis where it mediates the proliferation and survival of progenitor cells.  It is lost in most differentiated tissues but re-expressed in a number of cancers including breast cancer.  We have shown that when Six1 is expressed out of context in adult cells, it aberrantly promotes both proliferation and survival, contributing to tumorigenesis.  Our preliminary evidence shows that Six1 also brings about an epithelial-to-mesenchymal-like transition (EMT) in cultured cells and promotes metastasis in vivo.  Our proposed experiments are therefore directed at testing the following tri-partite hypothesis:   
 Misexpression of Six1 after development is complete imparts not only a pro-proliferative and survival phenotype, but also a pro-migratory and invasive phenotype, contributing to metastatic disease.  
 Acquisition of the invasive phenotype is due to a Six1-dependent increase in TGF- signaling.  
 The resulting aggressive, metastatic mammary tumors remain dependent on Six1 for survival and for their aggressive behavior.   
In the proposed research we will provide definitive tests of these hypotheses both in vitro and in vivo and begin to decipher the molecular mechanism by which Six1 causes EMT and metastasis, focusing on the TGF-  signaling pathway.  Our aims are: 1) To determine whether TR-I expression and signaling is required for Six1-mediated oncogenic EMT in cultured mammary epithelial cells; 2) To determine in xenograft models whether Six1 overexpression is necessary and sufficient to cause metastatic breast disease, through upregulation of TGF- signaling; 3) To use inducible transgenic models of Six1 overexpression to determine whether the invasive behavior of the resulting mammary tumors is due to TGF-  signaling, and whether this behavior remains dependent on Six1.    
Relevance: Six1 is overexpressed in a much higher percentage of metastatic (90%) compared to primary breast cancers (50%) and its overexpression is often correlated with advanced tumor stage and worsened survival.  Further, Six1 influences multiple stages of the tumorigenic process.  For this reason therapeutic agents targeting Six1 have the potential to inhibit breast cancer at both early and later stages of disease progression.  Because Six1 is lost in most adult tissues such therapeutic agents should have limited side effects.  
Project Narrative: Expression of the Six1 homeobox gene causes both tumor initiation and metastasis. Thus, therapeutic agents targeting Six1 have the potential to inhibit breast cancer at both early and later stages of disease progression.  Further, because Six1 is expressed only during embryogenesis, and not in the adult, therapies that target Six1 should inhibit tumor cell growth and metastasis with limited side effects.

A recent phase
HI clinical trial demonstrated a benefit for temozolomide-chemoradiation (TMZ-CR) over radiation alone.
While these results have changed the standard of care for newly diagnosed GBM patients, it is clear that
only a fraction of patients derive significant benefit from this treatment, with overall two-year survival in the
TMZ-CR treated patients only 26%. Since diagnosis and treatment decisions in GBM are currently based
on histopathology alone, there is a need to: 1) develop sensitive and specific markers to prospectively
distinguish those patients who will respond to standard TMZ-CR as initial treatment from those who will not
respond; and 2) determine important molecular alterations that define the resistant tumors to design
rational trials for patients who will not benefit from TMZ-CR alone. We have mined independent microarray
datasets to identify an initial multimarker panel that robustly predicts outcome in GBM. We find that a
molecular subtype, defined by overexpression of mesenchymal/angiogenic genes, is predictive of poor
outcome. In Aim 1, will refine this panel using 2 independent sets of tumor samples from TMZ-CR treated
patients at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) and the Mayo Clinic
College of Medicine. We will include a larger (-400) set of genes to ensure that an optimal gene panel can
be identified that predicts progression-free survival. We will incorporate additional relevant markers,
including MGMT and Akt signaling intermediates. Aim 2 will rigorously test and validate this multimarker
panel using patient samples from a large phase III clinical trial. The newly opened RTOG 05-25 trial, with a
requirement of tissue submission, provides an unprecedented opportunity to study a large (n=834) cohort
of uniformily-treated GBM patients using modern molecular techniques to identify a definitive set of
predictive markers. Aim 3 will focus on markers of response from novel agents targeted to recurrent GBM
patients who have failed TMZ-CR. It is expected that tumors from most of these patients will display the
mesenchymal/angiogenic phenotype, and we will therefore identify potential agents which target that
phenotype in GBM. The results of this project will set the stage for future trials, in which newly diagnosed

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myocardial ischemia and subsequent heart failure are leading causes of hospitalization and death. Stem cells are a promising treatment modality for injured cardiac tissue and may mediate their beneficial cardiac effects in part by paracrine mechanisms. Stem cell treatment of injured cardiac tissue may reduce inflammation, apoptosis, infarct size and improve function via factors that promote tissue repair. This paracrine protection may be enhanced by ex vivo modification. Genetic modification, VEGF transduction, and even preconditioning have been shown to enhance stem cell paracrine cardioprotection in animal models. Interestingly, we have recently shown that modulation of cytokines may enhance protective growth factor production. IL-18, a novel member of the IL-1 cytokine superfamily, is now recognized as an important regulator of innate and acquired immune responses. Recent research indicates that IL-18 may play an important role in acute graft versus host disease after stem cell transplantation. IL-18 has also been reported to play an antiangiogenic role in bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells. However, the effect of IL-18 on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) production of growth factors remains unknown. Thus, it is important to delineate the effects of IL-18 signaling in stem cell activation in order to further understand the role of stem cells in cardiac disease and maximize stem cell protective factors during therapeutic myocardial protection. We hypothesize that: 1) IL-18 will decrease MSC production of growth factors through p38 MARK, ERK or Akt signals; 2) IL-18 binding protein may neutralize the negative effects of IL-18 on MSC release of growth factors and enhance MSC cardioprotection during ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). To address these hypotheses we propose the following four specific aims: 1. To determine whether IL-18 signaling affects activated mesenchymal stem cell production of VEGF, HGF, IGF-1 and the cytokine TNF, and if so, whether this effect is mediated by p38 MARK, ERK, or Akt signaling. 2. To determine whether IL-18 binding protein may neutralize the effect of IL-18 on MSC release of VEGF, HGF, IGF-1 and the cytokine TNF. 3. To elucidate whether IL-18 signaling affects mesenchymal stem cell proliferation and apoptosis, and if so, whether targeted knockdown of VEGF or HGF expression by siRNA may neutralize these effects. 4. To determine whether MSC myocardial protection during I/R may be enhanced by IL-18 binding protein. PUBLIC HEALTH IN LAY TERMS: Bone marrow stem cells may be useful to fix injured hearts. We aim to study a protein called IL-18 so that we can utilize the ability of stem cells to protect the heart.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this study is to investigate the role and molecular mechanisms of tissue kallikrein in cardiac protection after myocardial infarction in normal and genetically modified animals. Our recent studies have shown that tissue kallikrein gene or protein delivery protects against organ damage in the heart, kidney and brain through anti- oxidative, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and angiogenic effects. These results indicate that kallikrein is a pleiotropic agent ideal for combined gene and stem cell therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we hypothesize that tissue kallikrein gene delivery or kallikrein modified-mesenchymal stem cell (TK-MSC) implantation provides superior benefits in cardiac repair by inhibiting apoptosis and promoting neovascularization and cardiomyocyte regeneration. We intend to fulfill the following specific aims: 1) determine the effect and signaling mechanisms of tissue kallikrein on angiogenesis, arteriogenesis and ventricular remodeling in rats after myocardial infarction, and on migration, growth and capillary tube formation in endothelial cells; 2) determine whether tissue kallikrein directly activates kinin B2 receptors via proteolysis, independent of kinin formation, to prevent cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation and cardiac dysfunction in kininogen- deficient rats after acute myocardial infarction; 3) determine the viability and effects of TK-MSCs on cardiac function as well as their paracrine effects on cardiomyocyte apoptosis and inflammation in rats after acute myocardial infarction; 4) determine the effects of graft TK-MSCs on cardiac repair and remodeling by promoting neovascularization and cardiac regeneration in rats with post-infarction heart failure. Our long-term goal is to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for myocardial repair and regeneration of damaged myocardium using kallikrein gene and cell-based therapies. This study should generate new and important information to provide the impetus for developing therapeutic regimens in the prevention of heart failure.

This process is not only essential for cartilage development but also during joint repair. Research on molecular mechanisms of chrondrogenesis will advance our understanding of skeletal development and has the potential to identify new approaches to the treatment of joint diseases. The Sox9 high-mobility group (HMG) domain transcription factor is a key molecule in chondrocyte differentiation. Expression of Sox9 almost parallels that of Col2a1, which encodes cartilage-specific type II collagen during chondrogenesis. In the genital ridge, however, Col2a1 is not expressed, despite high level of endogenous Sox9 expression, suggesting the existence of molecular partner(s) of Sox9 that are required for cartilage-specific Cola1 gene expression. In preliminary studies, we identified PGC-1 as a Sox9 transcriptional co-activator. PGC-1 was previously known as PPAR gamma co-activator and plays a role in adipogenesis and glycogenesis; however, its role in chondrogensis has been unexplored. Whole mount in situ hybridization of day 10-12 mice embryos revealed PGC-1 gene expression only in cells at chondrogenic sites. PGC-1 interacts with Sox9 to enhance Col2a1 promoter activity and promotes chondrogenesis. Furthermore, Sox9 activity on the Col2a1 is tightly regulated by acetylation and deacetylation molecules. CBP (CREB binding protein), one of the chromatin acetylation enzymes, was also shown to interact with Sox9/PGC-1 complex and is involved in this mechanism. These preliminary data provide the basis for our hypothesis that PGC-1 functions as a tissue and developmental stage specific co-activator of Sox9 during chondrogenesis in a mechanism that involves specific chromatin regulation. Toward this end, we propose following Specific Aims: 1. Determine the role of PGC-1 as a co-activator of Sox9 during chondrogenesis and chondrocyte-specific gene expression. 2. Determine the role of Sox9/PGC-1 complex associating HAT activity and subsequent chromatin regulation for tissue specific gene expression and chondrocyte differentiation. 3. Examine mechanisms by which Sox9/PGC-1 complex dependent gene expression is regulated by HDACs and related co-repressor complex during chondrogenesis. 4. Analyze chromatin dependent Sox9/PGC-1 complex transcription mechanism by using in vitro reconstitution of chromatin and transcription assay of the Col2al promoter.","320477",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tissue engineering approaches have been explored as a means to create grafts for ligament reconstruction procedures without potential donor-site morbidity. Our long-term goal is the creation of a tissue-engineered bone-ligament-bone graft that fully reproduces the tissue architecture found at the insertions in vivo. We believe that both extracellular matrix (ECM) alignment and controlled ECM heterogeneity are crucial elements to the long-term success of such an autologous implant. However, use of patient-derived marrow stromal cells (MSCs) to produce grafts with these characteristics is hampered by a lack of clear understanding of what occurs near the ligament-bone interface to direct alignment and differentiation of these cells. Therefore, as a first step toward our long-term goal, the objective of this application is to use a unique system combining a novel layered, enzyme-sensitive hydrogel carrier and precise control of macroscopic loading parameters to determine how two important characteristics of the extracellular environment, physicochemical properties of the surroundings and co-culture with osteoblasts, influence alignment and phenotypic expression by MSCs. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that, under cyclic tension, expression of the fibroblastic phenotype by MSCs can be modulated in a predictable manner by altering 1) physicochemical characteristics of the microenvironment and 2) the presence of nearby osteoblasts. Our overall objective will be accomplished by testing our central hypothesis in the following two specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of biochemical properties (adhesive ligand concentration) and physical properties (enzymatic degradation of the polymeric network) of the hydrogel microenvironment on cellular alignment and the extent of fibroblast phenotypic expression by encapsulated rabbit MSCs exposed to cyclic tensile loading over 21 days. 2) Determine the effect of the presence of osteoblasts on the timing and extent of fibroblastic/fibrochondrocytic differentiation by encapsulated rabbit MSCs under cyclic tensile loading over 21 days. The proposed work is innovative because the combination of a novel, well-defined three- dimensional cellular environment, including the laminated structures allowing for the co-culture of MSCs and osteoblasts, and the precise control of macroscopic mechanical loading provide a unique platform for controlled study of the influences on MSC differentiation near the bone-ligament interface. Completion of these studies is expected to distinguish the effects of the physicochemical properties of the microenvironment and the interplay with neighboring cells on the fibroblastic differentiation of MSCs. Such key information will direct the design of future strategies for production of patient-specific tissue-engineered grafts to replace damaged ligaments and restore full joint function.   
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal examines the effects of 1) chemical properties of the microenvironment and 2) interplay with neighboring cells on fibroblastic differentiation of marrow stromal cells in order to create a tissue-engineered bone-ligament-bone graft that reproduces the tissue architecture found at ligament-bone insertions in vivo.

Articular cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis is a major cause of disability affecting more than 43 million lives in the US. Damaged cartilage does not heal. Cartilage tissue engineering based on mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) technology offers the promise of manufacturable autologous tissue replacements of arbitrary size and shape, using cells from a bone marrow biopsy. This Bioengineering Research Grant proposal is driven by the need for cartilage tissue engineering to make the transition to a reproducible clinical therapy. To accomplish this, the processes involved must be thoroughly understood, and standardized protocols must be established. The global hypothesis underlying this proposal is that by exposing the cell scaffold constructs in a controlled, in vitro environment to conditions that favor chondrogenic differentiation, these constructs will develop the specific properties required for survival after implantation in the joint. Two major problems must be solved before tissue engineering can become a routine treatment for cartilage defects: transport of nutrients and waste products to and from the cells within the construct, and mechanical conditioning of the constructs to allow function in situ. We propose five Specific Aims, which address specific issues related to mass transport and mechanical conditioning, and their impact on construct functionality in vivo. These are: Specific Aim 1: To assess the mass transfer problem in cartilage tissue engineering. This will lead to better understanding of mass transfer within the constructs and will serve to evaluate the counter-measures proposed to improve mass transfer. Specific Aim 2: To develop a cartilage bioreactor monitoring and process control system. We will implement this technology to identify and characterize process control parameters in cartilage tissue engineering systems. Specific Aim 3: To develop countermeasures to specific mass transport limitations. In this Specific Aim, we will examine strategies to improve mass transfer in the constructs. Specific Aim 4: To implement and assess mechanical stimulation of the composites, using a system in which controlled, physiologically relevant loads can be applied, and identifying loading parameters that improve the mechanical properties of the construct. Specific Aim 5: To evaluate the composite constructs in vivo, as survival and integration of the manufactured construct in the joint defines the success of the tissue engineering process. The practical value of the proposed research is in the new insights it will provide into the technical issues surrounding cartilage tissue engineering and cartilage repair, and into the complex biology of the joint. If successful, these studies will provide novel principles and guidelines for the successful management of articular cartilage injuries.","312775",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
Stem cell transplantation offers much promise as a potential treatment for myocardial salvation at the end stages of coronary artery disease (CAD), and much interest has been placed in the differentiation capacity of different population of stem cells. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of stem cell differentiation in vivo, and under hostile conditions, like myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction leads to changes in the local microenvironment and increases oxidative stress, which can regulate cellular differentiation and survival. The long-term goal of our program is to study the biology of stem cells after transplantation to the heart. Our primary hypothesis in this proposal is that changes in oxidant status play a role in stem cell differentiation and survival in the mycoardium. To test that hypothesis we have the following specific aims: in Specific Aim 1 we will differentiate bone marrow stromal cells into cells with myocyte characteristics, both in cell culture and in living subjects, and we will use molecular techniques to track this differentiation non-invasively, something that could be done until recently. For that purpose we will use reporter imaging technology and optical imaging. In Specific Aim 2, we will examine if increased oxidative stress is involved in stem cell differentiation and survival. For that, will be induced in cell culture and in living subjects (after myocardial infarction), after which stem cell differentiation and survival will be tracked using molecular imaging techniques (optical imaging). In addition, we will study pathways related to oxidative stress (i.e. nitric oxide), and examine their role in stem cell differentiation. Lastly in Specific Aim 3, we will learn from Aims 1 and 2 and ""genetically engineer"" stem cells so they are better prepared to differentiate and survive in hostile condition, like the one found in states of myocardial ischemia and infarction.    
  
The studies proposed in this grant will provide invaluable information on the role that the micro-environment plays in stem cell differentiation and survival and can lead to novel and improved therapeutic strategies.  Stem cell therapy provides a great opportunity to re-constitute a damaged heart, but we first need to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate stem cell differentiation and survival. In this study we propose that specific biological pathways (i.e., oxidant status) can be involved in such response. Understanding these mechanisms that regulate stem cell survival will lead to better and improved therapies.  (End of Abstract)

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The work performed in this proposal will help in the development of tissue engineered cartilage constructs, to be commercialized as the TEC-AriTM method. The product is intended to be a tissue engineering service available to health care providers that involves the use of autologus cells to construct in vitro articular cartilage. The neotissue, produced using a self-assembling process, can be subsequently used to treat chondral, focal lesions. According to the CDC, more than 150,000 surgical procedures are preformed annually to treat knee lesions. The current state of the art treatment involves delivery of a cell suspension, which is not biomechanically functional, to the defect site. The self-assembling process is a novel tissue engineering method shown to be capable of producing neotissue without the use of an exogenous scaffold. Preliminary studies have shown that the mechanical properties of chondrocyte self-assembled neotissue can reach values on par with native adult tissue within 4 weeks. The objective of this application is to evaluate the feasibility of forming tissue engineered articular cartilage constructs using stromal mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in a self-assembling process. The study's hypotheses are 1) the self-assembling process, when applied to MSCs will result in tissue engineered articular cartilage constructs of clinically relevant dimensions (discs more than 1 mm thick and 5 mm in diameter); and 2) the functional properties of the self-assembled MSC constructs will be tantamount to those of native articular cartilage. To examine these hypotheses, the following specific aims have been proposed: 1) to form tissue engineered constructs using MSCs and the self-assembling process; and 2) to compare the functionality of self-assembled MSC constructs to self-assembled chondrocyte constructs and to native tissue. MSCs, differentiated into chondrocytes, will be allowed to self-assemble to form tissue engineered constructs. These constructs will then be cultured with or without confinement and with or without sequential seeding to determine an optimal construct formation method that will be used for the second specific aim. 'Optimal' is defined as the set of conditions producing properties closest to native tissue in terms of extracellular matrix composition and biomechanical properties. An optimal method must also yield constructs 1 mm thick or thicker. Self-assembled constructs formed using MSCs and native chondrocytes using the optimal method determined in aim 1 will then be cultured and compared to native articular cartilage in terms of biochemistry and biomechanics. Completion of this work is pivotal toward commercialization of the TEC-Ari method which is expected to address the yet unsolved clinical problem of articular cartilage defects.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The work performed in this proposal will help foster new strategies for articular cartilage regeneration. Advancing our clinical capabilities to treat cartilage defects, by engineering articular cartilage, which is then integrated functionally into the joint, will significantly improve the quality of life of millions of people who suffer with cartilage ailments. Ariston Medical's innovative approach to cartilage regeneration using a self- assembling process has the potential to reduce the burdens and disability caused by cartilage degeneration.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanism by which bone cell networks respond to load-induced mechanical signals is poorly understood. The long term goals of this project are to gain a better understanding of mechanotransduction in bone cell networks, composed of multiple cell types, and how disrupting this mechanotransduction in vivo affects load-induced osteogenesis. We propose that gap junctional intercellular communication and release of nucleotides, specifically adenosine triphosphate (ATP), from osteocytic or osteoblastic cells, are both essential to maximize bone cell response to the physical environment. Our central hypothesis is that biophysical signals, such as fluid flow, stimulate osteoblast proliferation and differentiation via a mechanism involving mobilization of cytosolic Ca2+, activation of GJIC and release of ATP through gap junction hemichannels. We will examine this hypothesis through the completion of four specific aims: 1) quantify the effect of fluid flow, in the presence and absence of agents that inhibit cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization, on GJIC, activation of GJ hemichannels and release of ATP by bone cells; 2) examine the effect of fluid flow on bone cell proliferation; 3) examine the effect of fluid flow on bone cell differentiation and 4) examine load-induced osteogenesis in bones isolated from connexin deficient mice. During this five-year project we will utilize a novel co-culture fluid flow apparatus, shRNA strategies, site-directed mutagenesis an innovative proteomics approach, a well characterized in vivo bone loading apparatus and transgenic murine models to examine whether osteocytic cells exposed to mechanical signals communicate proliferation and differentiation inducing signals to osteoblastic cells, a dogma of bone cell biology with surprisingly little experimental support, and if so the importance of this to in vivo mechanotransduction. An understanding of how mechanical signals are detected by bone cells and communicated throughout the bone cell network is important to understanding how bone adapts to its physical environment. This will in turn provide insights as to novel therapeutic targets for many musculoskeletal pathologies. Additionally, an understanding of how mechanical signals regulate bone cell proliferation and differentiation would be beneficial in designing in vitro environments, i.e. bioreactors, for novel bone tissue engineering protocols.

Previous attempts to repair articular cartilage have focused on the repair of focal defects. One of the
main complications of focal defect repair is that integration of the repair tissue with the surrounding native
cartilage is inconsistent and generally poor, which renders the repair site biomechanically unstable not
clinically efficacious. In the case of severe osteoarthritis where the entire joint surface has deteriorated, the
procedures for repair of focal cartilage defects are no longer applicable. For severe arthritis, total joint
replacement is the final option which, although it has a generally good outcome, there are still long-term
complications including, erosion of the articulating surface of the prostheses, and breaking or loosening of
the prosthetic stem. These problems necessitate revision surgery which is progressively more difficult and
complicated. To obviate this problem, we propose to design and test a tissue engineered cell-matrix
composite for the total resurfacing of a joint or joint compartment, which is designed to eliminate cartilage-tocartilage
integration problems and provide a cell-based option for totally resurfacing joints without totally
replacing them.

The primary challenges for tissue engineering the total cartilage resurfacing of a joint are to produce
viable cartilage tissue of sufficient thickness and surface area to cover an entire joint, to produce cartilage
that has appropriate mechanical properties to support the in vivo mechanical demands, and to ensure the
integration of the construct with underlying bone. The goal of this proposal is to produce functional
autologous cartilage constructs using tissue engineering principles wherein autologous cells, such as
Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs), auricular or articular chondrocytes are used to produce full-thickness
replacement cartilage and that is then fused and allowed to integrate onto sub-chondral bone, thus totally
replacing the deteriorated cartilage with autologous engineered cartilage.

This approach is based on the hypothesis that the production of full-thickness cartilage implants
obviates the intractable difficulty of lateral cartilage integration, and functional long-term repair will be
accomplished by producing biomechanically sound autologous cartilage.

The specific aims of this proposal are:

1. To produce implantation-ready tissue engineered cartilage constructs: In a rabbit model, MSCs
and culture-expanded chondrocytes will be used to produce full-thickness (300 um) cartilage constructs of
sufficient area to cover an entire humeral condyle. Variables to be tested include the use of auricular or
articular chondrocytes or MSCs; hyaluronan- or collagen-based scaffolds; and variations in culture conditions
such as cell seeding density, medium flow rate, and the addition of growth factors such as TGF-p1, TGFpS,
BMPs, and omega-3 fatty acids.

1. To test implantation-ready constructs in an ex vivo model for cartilage resurfacing: Implant
materials synthesized to the proper thickness and surface area will be fixed onto explanted rabbit humeral
condyles using four adhesive methods: a calcium phosphate paste, fibrin glue, a final using the zero-length
cross-linker1-Ethyl-3-{3-dimethylaminopropyl} carbodiimide, and APTMS-MBA (aminopropyltrimethoxysilanemethylenebisacrylamide),
a non-toxic polymer adhesive. These adhesive materials will be tested for their
biomechanical properties in vitro, in organ culture, and after implantation into athymic mouse hosts for up to
6 weeks. Biomechanical properties to be tested include a map of surface stiffness, and measures under
uniaxial tension and horizontal shear (to failure). MRI imaging, histological examination, and
immunochemistry will be used to determine the consistency of cartilage thickness and integration into
subchondral bone.

2. To test constructs in an in vivo model of cartilage resurfacing in rabbits: Autologous
engineered cartilage constructs will be used to resurface entire humeral condyles in rabbits. The implants
will be harvested and examined for biomechanical properties and histology at 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks post-implantation.
Through the use of the Cell, Bioreactor and Imaging Cores, the goals of this proposal will be more
easily and efficiently accomplished. The Core components are very appropriate for this project as there is a
high demand for cells (chondrocytes and MSCs), bioreactors are need to fabricate cartilage tissue, and
imaging is needed for outcome analysis.

If these studies are successful, the follow-up study would be to reproduce these results in a large
animal pre-clinical model such as in sheep or goats. The long-term objective of this study is to provide an
alternative treatment for severe arthritis of diarthrodial joints that is composed of living autologous tissue
which, hopefully, will provide many years of functional use before the need for total joint replacement."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) based bone tissue engineering has become a potential alternative approach for craniofacial skeletal defect repair. Bone regeneration and integration are influenced both by properties of tissue-engineered constructs and pathophysiological environments of implantation sites. For practical clinical application, a stimulus to improve effectively the differentiation potentials of MSCs is demanded. Current positive outcomes of bone tissue engineering have been established utilizing young and healthy hosts. The influence of pathophysiological conditions such as osteoporosis on bone formation and integration of engineered bone is still elusive. Estrogen has been known to inhibite bone resorption and increase bone formation. It was found recently that estrogen can improve osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow MSCs. We hypothesize that estrogen can be employed to up-regulate osteogenic potential of MSCs for optimizing tissue-engineered constructs in vitro and to improve bone formation and osteo-integration in vivo. The overall objective of this project is to optimize estrogen modulation of tissue-engineered constructs and investigate bone formation of optimized constructs at different host environments. Effects of estrogen of various concentrations will be assessed for differentiation of MSCs-based constructs in vitro (Aim 1) and bone formation in vivo (Aim 2). Bone regeneration and integration of optimized constructs will be evaluated in femur bone defects in hosts with different estrogen levels (Aim 3). This project will provide important information for clinical applications of bone tissue engineering. The obtained data during this R03 grant will be included in to an R01 application striving to optimize the properties of MSCs-based constructs and pathophysiological environments for skeletal tissue engineering. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 09/04, Reissued 4/2006) Page Continuation Format Page This project will provide crucial information of estrogen on bone tissue engineering for clinical application. The current project is to explore estrogen as a modulator to improve mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based bone formation. We will investigate estradiol to modulate MSCs-based tissue engineered constructs in vitro and to improve the bone formation and osteo-integration in osteoporotic environments.

This research addresses 3 important clinical problems: filling tendon defects with biological constructs to reduce pain and stiffness and to provide grafts for revision surgery; repairing large rotator cuff tears and augmenting ligament reconstructions; and repairing chronic degenerative tendon injuries. Using a functional tissue engineering or FTE roadmap with linked in vitro and in vivo studies, we will establish in vivo forces and displacements for 4 activities of daily living in the rabbit patellar tendon model (PT) (Aim 1). Using a novel design strategy, 6 mechanical treatment factors will then be varied in culture to optimize the construct's tangent stiffness before surgery (Aim 2). Constructs with significantly different tangent stiffness values will be implanted in rabbit PT defects to examine significant improvements in repair stiffness (Aim 3). We will thus test a series of related hypotheses: Hyp 1. The rabbit PT maintains non-zero tissue strain and force for all activities. Hyp 2. Increasing the grade or inclination of the gait surface increases in vivo force and strain parameters. Hyp 3. Rabbit and mouse constructs exposed to in vivo strain shapes develop higher tangent stiffness than constructs exposed to trapezoidal or sinusoidal profiles. Hyp 4. Increasing strain amplitude, within physiological limits, increases tangent stiffness in culture. Hyp. 5. Strain patterns with similar times to rise and fall and similar periods as in vivo signals exhibit the largest stiffness values in culture. Hyp 6. Mouse constructs having the largest tangent stiffness in culture exhibit the greatest increases in col I gene expression. Hyp 7. Increasing construct stiffness in culture increases repair stiffness after surgery and better aligns cells and extracellular matrix in the repair site. Our novel, interactive in vitro / in vivo study should help to develop in vitro predictors of in vivo repair outcome after surgery that also apply to other tissue systems.","399658",

permits pain-free movement by greatly reducing friction between bones and distributing stress. Unfortunately,
when cartilage is damaged due to injury or disease, it has a limited capacity to heal and can lead to premature
arthritis. Arthritis is a major health issue that is predicted to increase as our population ages. As such, there is
considerable interest in the development of techniques to repair or reconstruct damaged articular cartilage.
The implications of a successful method for cartilage repair would be great in terms of the number of patients
affected and their quality of life. Importantly, in this era of escalating health care costs, successful cartilage
repair would decrease the long-term costs of health care related to joint replacement and multiple revisions
thereof. Our long-term objective is to develop a tissue engineering approach for cartilage repair using
periosteum. Periosteal grafts have the potential to contribute to each of the three requirements for tissue
engineering (scaffold, cells, growth factors), and have been used successfully in biological resurfacing for the
repair of damaged articular cartilage. The principle obstacle to overcome for the use of periosteal tissue grafts
for tissue engineering is the declining chondrogenic potential of periosteum with increasing age of the patient.
We hypothesize that subperiosteal injection of specific growth factors can be used as a pretreatlnent to
""activate"" periosteum for articular cartilage tissue engineering. In essence, the engineered tissue will be
prepared in vivo for transplantation. In this proposal, we plan to examine the potential for subperiosteal
injection of known chondrogenic growth factors to enhance (1) the number of chondrogenic precursor cells in
periosteum in vivo (Aim 1), (2) the in vitro chondrogenic potential of periosteum (Aim 2) and (3) the
potential of periosteum to repair articular cartilage defects (Aim 3). Beyond articular cartilage repair, these
 studies have the potential to impact the use of periosteum for other applications such as tissue engineering of
bone. In addition, by eliminating the need for cell culture expansion facilities and expertise, the cost of this
 approach should be considerably less thereby making cartilage repair more globally accessible.","45847",

Our strategy for repair involves a cell-laden hydrogel that can be injected in a defect and polymerized (solidified) in a minimally invasive manner using light. Mesenchymal stem cells photoencapsulated in a biomaterial scaffold will provide the basis for tissue repair.  
  
This proposal is both hypothesis and design driven. We hypothesize that degrading hydrogels will enhance tissue matrix production and will therefore investigate the synthesis of novel hydrogels with degradable phosphoester units. We also hypothesize that creating multilayered hydrogel structures will allow us to coculture cells in a 3D environment to 1.) engineer the zonal organization of cartilage, 2.) engineer osteochondral tissues, and 3.) investigate the influence of cell interactions (coculture) on tissue development. The design driven portion of the proposal will develop a clinically practical strategy for cartilage repair. The repair strategy will address 1.) biomaterial integration to the surrounding tissue and 2.) engineering new cartilage repair in an injectable hydrogel. The integration strategy will comprise a primer based on the biopolymer, chondroitin sulfate, modified with chemistries to provide a covalent bridge between cartilage and the injected hydrogel biomaterial. The envisioned tissue repair materials can be injected into a defect and photopolymerized in a minimally invasive fashion. To test these hypotheses and design the repair system the following specific aims will be investigated:  
Specific aim 1. Development of a novel biodegradable phosphoester-PEG photopolymerizing polymer for engineering cartilage and bone using adult bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.  
Specific aim 2. Engineering of multilayered hydrogels for development of zonally organized cartilage and osteochondral tissues.  
Specific aim 3. Chemical attachment of hydrogels to cartilage for improved tissue-implant integration in the joint.","271195",

The proposed research originated to complement the principle investigator's background in the development of novel photocrosslinkable biomaterials for bone tissue engineering with a long-term objective of developing complex materials at the interface of bone and cartilage for craniofacial applications. It is the general goal of the principle investigator to develop an internationally recognized research laboratory that uses the synthesis and modification of novel materials as a platform for the development of clinically relevant therapeutics. The proposed research and career development program outlined in this proposal were developed by the principle investigator and Mentors from both the Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in an effort to achieve this goal.  
  
Photopolymerizable hydrogels have many properties that are beneficial for cartilage tissue engineering including: the ability to form in vivo to fill complex defects with potential adhesive and integrative properties, both spatial and temporal control over the polymerization process, and biological signals are readily incorporated into the networks to control both cellular differentiation and tissue formation. These properties would be extremely beneficial for the regeneration of cartilage in craniofacial reconstruction. With these benefits in mind, the primary aims of the proposed research are to:  
  
.  synthesize and characterize photopolymerizable copolymer hydrogel networks that resorb via an enzymatic degradation process,  
.  investigate the quantity, distribution, and type of tissue formed by chondrocytes encapsulated in hydrogel networks as a function of hydrogel composition,  
.  incorporate signals into hydrogel networks to control the chondrogenic differentiation of photoencapsulated mesenchymal stem cells, and  
.  analyze critical issues of the photopolymerized constructs necessary for clinical application of these techniques.","135000",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation is a well orchestrated cascade of events that is necessary for normal bone development and repair/fracture healing. The objective of this application is to characterize the role of Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) on osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation, with the ultimate goal of using BMP-9 and its downstream targets (e.g. CTGF), as bone regeneration agents in patients. CTGF is a secreted protein which has four distinct modules (domains) that share structural homology to several extracellular matrix proteins. Each module may have one or more distinct functions. We have found that CTGF expression is consistently upregulated early in the pathway of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)-induced osteoblastic differentiation. Several BMPs, especially BMP9, have been shown to be potent stimulators of osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation. Interestingly, temporal regulation of CTGF expression may be essential for BMP-induced osteoblastic differentiation. In order to further understand the molecular events regulating osteogenic lineage-specific differentiation of mesenchymal stem cell and bone formation, we propose a series of hypothesis-driven experiments that will determine the role of CTGF in this well-orchestrated process. Specifically, we will determine: (1) whether specific modules of CTGF and temporal expression of CTGF regulate BMP9-induced osteoblastic differentiation in vitro; (2) if CTGF regulates BMP9-induced bone formation in a heterotopic bone formation animal model; and (3) whether temporally controlled CTGF silencing by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown modulates BMP9-induced osteoblastic differentiation in vitro, and heterotopic bone formation in vivo. Knowledge gained from these sets of experiments will expand our understanding of the role of BMPs and CTGF on osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and bone formation. Both BMPs and their downstream targets, like CTGF, can have a broad range of clinical applications in a number of orthopaedic conditions, such as enhancing recalcitrant fracture healing or promoting bone regeneration in patients.  
  
LAY STATEMENT: In normal development and bone healing, there is a well-orchestrated process of stimulating precursor cells to become bone-forming cells, and the eventual formation of bone. This proposal examines the function of an important factor (Connective Tissue Growth Factor) in this complex process of bone formation, with the goal of its application in fracture healing and bone regeneration in patients.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a novel electro-stimulatory approach for drug and gene delivery involving stimuli at both the macro- and nano-scales. This approach will provide improved cell viability over traditional electroporation and be widely applicable in the medical sciences. It will also lay the groundwork for a unique approach to direct differentiation of patient-derived stem cells in vitro and provide the applicant with the background and resources necessary to lead future investigations in gene and drug delivery, regenerative medicine, and other areas of medical science where the use of electrical energy may be exploited. We believe that the co-localization of cationic peptides with the plasma membrane (PM) of cells will allow us to reduce and explicitly control the electric field strength required for electroporation. We hypothesize that co-localization of cationic peptides with the PM of cells will add to the transmembrane voltage required to electroporate the PM, thus reducing the required intensity of an externally applied electric field. By varying charge density and concentration of cationic peptides about the PM, we will be able to explicitly control the electroporative field threshold. The research will proceed in three stages. First, we will develop cationic peptides of various positive charge densities and characterize their short- and long-term toxicity as well their influence on stem cell multi-potency (aim 1). We will then determine the effect of cationic peptide presence and charge density on electroporative efficiency using a fluorescent plasma membrane integrity indicator (aim 2). Finally, we will characterize the relationship between cationic peptide charge density, peptide extracellular concentration and the electric field strength required for effective electrotransfection of a reporter gene (aim 3). While this technology has wide application possibilities in drug and gene delivery, we intend to implement this technique in regenerative medicine. If our results confirm our hypothesis, then ultimately we envision implementing the proposed technique in peptide-patterned polyethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels in order to provide both spatial and sequential control over genetic expression and cell differentiation in environments appropriate for tissue regeneration. Upon completion of this research, we will have developed a powerful tool for directing the complex sequence of events required in regenerating heterogeneous, functional tissues from patient-derived stem cells. Such engineered tissues will solve many of the problems associated with transplant therapy, including, but not limited to, tissue and organ availability and immunorejection. Transplantation of regenerated tissues will directly contribute to public health in treating burn victims, broken bones, blindness, deafness, heart and vascular damage, liver and kidney damage, and organ failure.

biocompatible matrices to be used as custom-designed scaffolds in tissue engineering.
Scaffolds will be optimized via chemistry and processing to interact with mesenchymal
progenitor cells (MPCs) and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (Core 1) within environments
of bioreactors (Core 3). Our aim is to gain fundamental insight into the communication between
matrices and stem cells as a route to improve scaffold design and function. Our hypothesis is
that an improved match between scaffold design (chemistry, morphology and structure from the
molecular to macro-scale perspective) and stem cells will lead to improved structure and
function of engineered tissues.
The extent to which this improved 'communication' controls cell responses and tissue outcomes
is virtually an untapped area of scientific inquiry. Thus there is a great deal of insight to be
gained and applied to critical questions in biology related to surface interactions with cells. The
available evidence in the literature, and from our own preliminary studies, suggests that this is
an important topic that requires detailed inquiry in order to improve specific tissue engineering
strategies. Matrix-cell relationships can be in the form of the chemical and/or physical
interactions with the adherent cells. A key aspect of this core is the design and characterization
of tissue engineering scaffolds with desired ranges of surface chemistries, degradation rates,
mechanical properties and morphologies. Generating suitable polymer scaffolds is a critical step
in functional tissue engineering and the team at Tufts has extensive experience in this area. We
plan to build on our strong base of biopolymer synthesis and processing and associated inquiry
into cell responses as a basis for this core activity."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Inflammation is a key aspect of wound healing. In treatment of periodontal disease, periodontal regeneration of inflammation-mediated damage requires stem cell activity in the formation of bone periodontal ligament and cementum. The hypothesis considered in this project is that ""inflammatory signaling through NF-KB modulates stem cell differentiation along the osteoblastic lineage"". Only limited information is available regarding this aspect of mesenchymal stem cell biology, and there is the confounding possibility that inflammatory signals can be both positive and negative effectors of stem cell engraftment, specification and differentiation. Our long range goal of defining mesenchymal stem cell responses to NF-KB-mediated inflammatory stimuli may indicate new targets for improving periodontal regeneration. Experiments are proposed to address the following specific aims: I) to define the effect of NF-KB on mesenchymal stem cell osteoblastic differentiation; IicB super-repressor will be used to modulate cell function and pharmacologic inhibitors of IKK will be used to determine NF-KB effects on hMSCs. II) to determine the role of NF-KB on osteoinductive signaling; transient transfection of stem-like and osteoblastic cell lines will be used to define how inflammatory stimuli affect a) Smad signaling, b) RUNX2 transactivation and c) LRP5 signal transduction. Ill) to target inflammation in the therapeutic modulation of stem cell function during bone regeneration; a p6s cre/lox conditional knockout mouse will be used as a source of NF-KB deficient cells to study its role during stem cell engraftment and differentiation observed in ectopic bone formation models. Osteoblastic cell lines and human MSCs expressing NF-KB or IKB super-repressor will also be used to study inflammation effects on osteoinduction. Challenging these models with inflammatory agens and blocking with IKK inhibitors is proposed. Characterization of inflammatory signaling effects of the emergence bone forming cells for tissue repair may identify new therapeutic targets and avenues for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases like periodontitis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The skin consists of the outer layer, epidermis and the underlying layer of the dermis. The dermis induces and supports the hair follicles, glands, nerves, and blood vessels in the skin. People with Focal Dermal Hypoplasia, Aplasia Cutis Congenita, large wounds, and severe burns lack normal dermis and skin function. Despite the importance of the dermis, very little is known about the embryonic origins and fate selection of dermis in different parts of the mammalian embryo. The dermis can originate from the somites, lateral plate mesoderm, and the cranial neural crest. In this proposal, we will focus on the mechanisms of emergence and Wnt signaling function in craniofacial dermal lineage. With the recent advent of elegant genetic tools, it is only now possible to combine spatial and temporal mutational analysis of signaling pathways with cell lineage studies to determine how the dermal cell identity is induced and track the movements of dermal progenitors in the context of the embryo. We have identified a critical role for beta-catenin, the central transducer of Wnt signaling, in the development of craniofacial dermis in the mouse embryo. We are uniquely poised to address the specific aims of this proposal. In Aim1, we will characterize the emergence of the craniofacial dermal lineage with a combination of recently developed genetic lineage marking tools. In Aim2, we will define the mechanism of Wnt signaling function in craniofacial dermal lineage by analyzing tissue-specific conditional loss and gain of beta-catenin function mutants. In Aim3, we test the hypothesis that Dermol, the earliest dermal progenitor marker, is the critical mediator of Wnt signaling in promoting the dermal genetic program. The results from this study will provide the first comprehensive view of how the craniofacial dermis develops in the mouse embryo. Identifying the signal that promotes dermal cell fate in various progenitor tissues will enable us to guide mesenchymal stem cell differentiation along the dermal pathway and manufacture dermis that is capable of inducing hair and glands of the skin, accelerating wound healing, and restoring functional skin. The study of underlying mechanisms of dermal induction and development in different parts of the body offers an excellent model for understanding congenital dermal defects, acquired skin damage, and normal skin patterning.

remodeling. However, its therapeutic benefit is still controversial largely because most studies failed to
account for the variations in the initial infarct size and the extent of ventricular remodeling on the therapeutic
outcome; the fate (survival and differentiation status) of the grafted cells is not clear either. Therefore, the
overall goal of this proposal is to develop a multi-modality non-invasive imaging approach to best assess
these critical parameters. This system would allow assessment of the survival and differentiation of grafted
stem cells longitudinally in the same animals, on which the extent of initial impairment and experimental
recovery are evaluated. Specifically, two reporter genes (one for cell survival and the other for differentiation)
will be introduced: the survival marker is always ""on"" as long as the cell is alive, whereas the differentiation
marker is NOT turned on until the cardiac differentiation occurs in the cell. After stem cells are grafted,
survival fraction will be quantified by the expression of the reporter gene associated with the surviving cells,
using radionuclide imaging (PET) while cardiac differentiation of these cells will be detected / monitored by
optical imaging. Tagged or displacement encoded MRI will be used to quantify the regional myocardial
contractile function and to document the functional loss or gain during LV remodeling in response to stem
cell grafting. This strategy aims to maximize the sensitivity and spatial resolution necessary for specific
measurements. By using these imaging modalities in concert, a cohesive picture of stem cell survival,
differentiation in the infarcted myocardium and their therapeutic benefits will be obtained to address critical
issues regarding the fate and therapeutic mechanism of stem cells, i.e., do the grafted cells contribute to the
improvement of contractile function or they primarily provide structural support to ""stiffen"" the infarcted heart
wall, thus reduce the wall-stress?","417476",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is well documented in the orthopaedic literature that cigarette smoking has a negative impact on healing following long bone fracture and spinal fusion surgery. While the morbidity and financial burden of this clinical problem is significant, little progress has been made toward elucidating the underlying mechanisms that mediate the effects of smoking on skeletal healing. To begin addressing the question of mechanism, we propose to test a novel hypothesis which predicts that nicotine is a key component of cigarette smoke that affects the healing process by interacting with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACHR) expressed on mesenchymal stem cell membranes. More specifically, we hypothesize that activation of the nACHR in stem cells that are recruited to participate in healing processes that recapitulate endochondral ossification i) accelerates their progression through chondrogenesis and ii) inhibits or delays their subsequent progression to terminal maturation. To test this central hypothesis, we plan to address 3 Specific Aims. Experiments in Specific Aim 1 will characterize the impact of nicotine and cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on nACHR expression and signaling in mouse limb bud mesenchymal cells via mRNA and protein analysis and second messenger signaling assays. Experiments in Specific Aim 2 will compare the impact of nicotine and CSE on in vitro chondrogenesis and chondrocyte maturation in MSCs derived from wild type and alpha4 nACHR null mice. We will also determine the role of specific signaling events in the nicotine-evoked phynotypic changes seen in these cells. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3 we propose to compare the effects of nicotine and cigarette smoke on endochondral bone formation using the in vivo model of femur fracture healing in mice. Fractured wild type or alpha4 knockout mice exposed to nicotine or cigarette smoke will be analyzed via histomorphometric, in situ hybridization, microCT and biomechanical testing methods. Completion of these aims will for the first time evaluate the lynchpin role of nicotine as a key component in cigarette smoke that negatively influences skeletal healing. Furthermore, proposed experiments aimed at identifying the mechanism underlying the deleterious effects of nicotine during healing will pave the way toward the development of clinical strategies that alleviate the poor outcomes associated with smoking.

Unfortunately, when cartilage is damaged due to injury or disease, it has a limited capacity to heal and can lead to premature arthritis. Arthritis is a major health issue that is predicted to increase as our population ages. As such, there is considerable interest in the development of techniques to repair or reconstruct damaged articular cartilage. The implications of a successful method for cartilage repair would be great in terms of the number of patients affected and their quality of life. Importantly, in this era of escalating health care costs, successful cartilage repair would decrease the long-term costs of health care related to joint replacement and multiple revisions thereof. Our long-term objective is to develop a tissue engineering approach for cartilage repair using periosteum. Periosteal grafts have the potential to contribute to each of the three requirements for tissue engineering (scaffold, cells, growth factors), and have been used successfully in biological resurfacing for the repair of damaged articular cartilage. The principle obstacle to overcome for the use of periosteal tissue grafts for tissue engineering is the declining chondrogenic potential of periosteum with increasing age of the patient. We hypothesize that subperiosteal injection of specific growth factors can be used as a pretreatlnent to ""activate"" periosteum for articular cartilage tissue engineering. In essence, the engineered tissue will be prepared in vivo for transplantation. In this proposal, we plan to examine the potential for subperiosteal injection of known chondrogenic growth factors to enhance (1) the number of chondrogenic precursor cells in periosteum in vivo (Aim 1), (2) the in vitro chondrogenic potential of periosteum (Aim 2) and (3) the potential of periosteum to repair articular cartilage defects (Aim 3). Beyond articular cartilage repair, these studies have the potential to impact the use of periosteum for other applications such as tissue engineering of bone. In addition, by eliminating the need for cell culture expansion facilities and expertise, the cost of this approach should be considerably less thereby making cartilage repair more globally accessible.","311812",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the many therapeutic strategies undertaken for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme, the survival rate for patients afflicted with this aggressive cerebral malignancy remains low. Even with the combined use of several therapeutic modalities, a good prognosis is extremely rare as the remaining cancer cells inevitably infiltrate the normal brain tissue and cause tumor recurrence. We propose to study the interaction of umbilical cord blood stem cells with cancer cells that have a specific prevalence to gliomas. In the present proposal, we will study the molecular mechanisms that control invasion, migration, and angiogenesis in pre-established intracranial tumors of glioblastoma cells using mesenchymal stem cells from the human umbilical cord to chase these tumor cells and regress tumor growth. We hypothesize that: (1) the interaction of stem cells with glioma cells will initiate apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth; and (2) the interaction of stem cells with glioma cells will decrease expression of several signaling molecules and other proteins involved in cell survival, adhesion, migration and proliferation. The specific aims to address these hypotheses are as follows: Specific aim 1. Determine the effect of cord blood stem cells on the molecular mechanisms of proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis in glioblastoma and xenograft cell lines. Specific aim 1a: Determine the effect of cord blood stem cells on adhesion and migration of established glioblastoma cell lines and glioma xenograft cells. Specific aim 1b: Evaluate the effect of cord blood stem cells on the molecular mechanisms of proliferation in glioblastoma cell lines and xenograft cell lines. Specific aim 1c: Evaluate the effect of cord blood stem cells on the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis in glioma xenograft cells and glioblastoma cell lines. Specific aim 1d: Determine the effect of cord blood stem cells on the invasiveness of glioblastoma cell lines and glioma xenograft cells. Specific aim 2: Evaluate the in vivo effects of cord blood stem cells on pre-established intracranial tumor growth, and invasiveness and angiogenesis of human glioblastoma cell lines and glioma xenograft cells. Specific aim 2a: Determine the effect of the cord blood stem cells on pre-established intracranial tumor growth of human glioblastoma cell lines and glioma xenograft cells injected intracerebrally in nude mice. Specific aim 2b: Determine the effect of cord blood stem cells on the molecular mechanisms of cerebral angiogenesis in both in vitro and in vivo models. We anticipate that these results will substantially augment our understanding of how these stem cells chase and attach to these tumor cells; thus, the information gained should be of help in developing new therapeutic approaches to treating glioblastomas.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Prostate cancer is a disease typified by a reactive stroma response, which is likely tumor promoting. The reactive stroma is composed of myofibroblasts and fibroblasts, activated to remodel extracellular matrix and induce angiogenesis. This response is similar to generic wound repair responses. In the previous project period, we have defined reactive stroma in human prostate cancer progression and have developed new models to address mechanisms of reactive stroma biology. These studies have shown the induction of reactive stroma during prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and evolution with cancer progression. Elevated expression of TGF-beta1 by PIN epithelium was correlated with induction of adjacent reactive stroma. To address reactive stroma mechanisms, we developed the differential reactive stroma (DRS) model. The DRS model permits transgene gene expression in both the stromal and epithelial compartments of a human xenograft tumor in host mice. Our recent studies show that tumor incidence, angiogenesis, and tumor growth are dependent on reactive stroma. Different human prostate stromal cell lines produced differential tumorigenesis. Differential expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in stromal cells was associated with tumorigenesis. CTGF is a downstream mediator of TGF-beta1 action in stroma and a stimulator of angiogenesis. Inhibition of TGF-beta1 action in DRS tumors inhibited angiogenesis and tumor growth. Furthermore, FGF-2 action regulates reactive stroma, particularly in a TGF-beta1 microenvironment. It is our hypothesis that TGF-beta31 induced reactive stroma is a critical regulator of angiogenesis in early prostate cancer, and that both CTGF and FGF-2 are key co-regulatory factors of TFG-beta1 paracrine actions in reactive stroma. We propose three Specific Aims to address this hypothesis in detail: 1.) To test the hypothesis that the paracrine action of epithelial expressed TGF-beta1 is a key inducer of prostate reactive stroma and that TGF-beta1 induced reactive stroma drives angiogenesis and tumor progression; 2.) To test the hypothesis that FGF-2 functions as a co-regulator with TGF-beta1 in reactive stroma induced angiogenesis and tumor progression; 3.) To test the hypothesis that CTGF functions as a key downstream mediator of TGF-beta1 and FGF-2 action in reactive stroma. These studies will dissect the paracrine and autocrine actions of these growth factors in reactive stroma regulation of prostate cancer using novel transgenic and DRS model approaches. The proposed studies will expand our understanding of the role of interdependent epithelial-stromal signaling in prostate cancer and may lead to new therapeutic approaches targeted to specific mechanisms in the reactive stroma compartment.

However, the role of Hh signaling in differentiated osteoblasts during adult bone homeostasis remains to be elucidated. In addition, Hh signaling is also required to control chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy. In the past year we found that in the postnatal bone, Hh signaling activity was progressively reduced as osteoblasts mature. To characterize the function of Hh signaling in adult bone homeostasis, we have manipulated Hh signaling selectively in mature osteoblasts in adult mice using the Cre-lox system. Upregulation of Hh signaling by removing Patched 1 (Ptch1), a negative regulator of Hh signaling, leads to increased bone formaion and excessive bone resorption. As a consequence, these mice show severe osteopenia. Conversely, inhibition of Hh signaling in mature osteoblasts by inactivating Smoothened (Smo), a positive regulator of Hh signaling, resulted in increased bone mass and protection from bone loss during aging. Our results demonstrate that Hh signaling is required in mature osteoblasts to regulate both bone formation and resorption and inhibition of Hh signaling protects bone loss during the normal course of aging. We have also found that Hh signaling promotes chondrocyte hypertrophy in the adult joint, suggesting that activated Hh signaling maybe a risk factor for osteoarthritis.","438693",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cell elongation, either due to spread or stretch, induces lung embryonic mesenchymal cells to follow a myogenic pathway [1-3].  Using these systems we identified by suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH) two similar stretch-responsive factors, which we referred to as tension-induced/inhibited proteins (TIPs) -1 and -3.  A third isoform of intermediate Mf/, TIP-2, was identified in the GenBank, hut it was not present in the lung.  A Genomic BLAST search indicated that the three TIPs were originated by alternative splicing from a single gene. Immunohistochemical studies and tagging with green fluorescence protein (GFP) demonstrated that TIPs translocate between nucleus and cytoplasm.  TIPs display signature motifs characteristic of nuclear receptor coregulators and chromatin remodeling enzymes. Functional studies encompassing overexpression of TIPs and gene silencing using small interfering RNAs (siRNA) indicated that TIP-1 and -3 are involved in the cell's selection between the myogenic and adipogenic pathways. TIP- 1, induced by stretch, promotes myogenesis while TIP-3, inhibited by tension initiates adipogenesis. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that TIPs may act through a mechanism of chromatin remodeling.  Since the lung has bronchial smooth muscle (SM), interstitial myofibroblasts and lipofibroblasts, we hypothesize that the development of these cell types is determined at least in part by TIPs. The specific aims of this project will be: Aim 1.  To determine whether modulation of TIP-1 and TIPS alters bronchial SM, myofibroblasts and lipofibroblasts development in lung organ cultures and organotypic cultures.  Aim 2. To elucidate the transcription factors that are activated by TIP-1 and TIP-3 and whether gene acetylation, methylation or both are involved in TIP-induced transcription activation.  Aim 3. To identify the histone(s) that bind(s) to TIPs and to determine the TIP motifs that are required for histone-TIP binding.  Bronchial and vascular SM, myofibroblasts and lipofibroblasts are essential components of the lung.  These cells participate in multiple physiological processes and however very little is known about their development and the molecular mechanisms involved in their genesis.  The studies proposed in this application will provide therefore novel information on how the myogenic and adipogenic fates are determined in the embryonic lung at the cellular and molecular level.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The peripheral nervous system of vertebrates originates from two main cell classes: neural crest and cranial ectodermal placodes. Placodes are discrete regions of thickened epithelium that give rise to portions of the cranial sensory ganglia as well as form the paired sense organs (lens, nose, ears). Despite their importance to formation of the peripheral sensory nervous system in the head, comparatively little is known about the early development of the ectodermal placodes. The tools are now in hand to examine not only the basic developmental processes leading to placode development but also the molecular events underlying their formation. This knowledge is fundamental for understanding early development of the sensory organs/ganglia and to help identify and correct disorders in these essential structures. This proposal aims to characterize the cellular and molecular events underlying key events in development of placodes. Many of the experiments emphasize the olfactory placode since it is less well understood than many of the other placodes (e.g. otic, trigeminal). The olfactory placode arises within the anterior neural folds, which are the only region of the neuraxis that does not produce neural crest cells. We will assess the steps involved in competence, specification and commitment of the olfactory placode. We will explore whether and to what extent the olfactory placode has the capacity to form neural crest cells and vice versa by examining their ability to interchange for one another. Finally, we will examine the role of potential molecular regulators of placode formation/invagination and will functionally characterize selected novel molecular markers. Specific experiments will: 1) examine competence, specification and commitment of the olfactory placode. 2) examine whether olfactory placode can form neural crest and vice versa. 3) characterize the potential function of a novel chick spalt in placode development. 4) investigate the expression and function of Frzb-1 and an unknown gene, Placode-1 identified in a screen for placodal markers.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     
Blood vessel replacement is a common treatment for vascular diseases. Tissue engineering is a promising approach to the fabrication of non-thrombogenic and mechanically durable vascular grafts. Our goal is to engineer bone marrow stem cells and electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds to construct tissue-engineered vascular graft (TEVG) that closely matches the composition, structure and mechanical property of native blood vessel. Bone marrow contains vascular endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSC can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC). We hypothesize that: (1) bone marrow stem cells can be used to derive endothelial cells (ECs) and SMCs to construct TEVGs, (2) bioactive nanofibrous scaffolds with aligned nanofibers can promote MSC differentiation, matrix remodeling and the formation of microstructure as in native vessel, and (3) mechanical loading can promote MSC differentiation, matrix remodeling and EC monolayer retention. To test our hypothesis, four Specific Aims are proposed: (1) To engineer bioactive nanofibrous scaffolds and characterize MSC-scaffold interactions; (2) To determine MSC differentiation and matrix remodeling in TEVG in response to mechanical loading; (3) To construct EC monolayer in TEVG using EPCs and determine the effect of flow on EC remodeling; (4) To determine the remodeling and patency of small-diameter TEVGs in vivo. The nanofibers in the tubular scaffolds will be aligned in the circumferential direction to mimic the matrix alignment in native blood vessels and guide the MSC alignment. RGD peptide and TGF-p will be conjugated to the nanofibers to promote matrix remodeling and MSC differentiation into SMC. Mechanical loading will be applied to the tubular scaffolds to further enhance matrix remodeling and MSC differentiation. Bone marrow derived ECs will be cultured as monolayer on the luminal surface of TEVG, and will be pre-conditioned by fluid shear stress. The mechanical property and structure of the TEVGs will be determined. Bypass surgery will be performed in animal model to determine the continued remodeling and patency of small TEVGs. Manufacturing-related issues such as Good Manufacturing Practices, biomarker monitoring, storage and caling-up will be addressed. The accomplishment of this project will lead to the development of innovative technologies to engineer stem cells and nanofibrous scaffolds for the construction of small TEVGs.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
The Minnesota Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Clinical Research Network (MnCTN) is ideally suited to promote the evaluation of novel cell therapy strategies for individuals with cardiovascular disease. MnCTN will consist of the consortium of four Minneapolis cutting-edge cardiovascular institutions and the Minnesota Molecular and Cellular Therapeutics (part of the NHLBI-sponsored Production Assistance for Cellular Therapies (PACT) group). The MnCTN is critically important to the mission of the NIH, and the institutions in this application, all of which aim to improve patients' health and save lives, as it provides a unique opportunity to translate basic science of cell therapies into clinical research evaluating the potential of cell therapies as an alternative strategy to halt cardiovascular disease progression and improve patients' outcomes. The institutions of MnCTN have nationally recognized expertise with large clinical patient populations that have unmet treatment need and a high likelihood of benefit from cellular therapy (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, refractory angina, and end-stage heart failure, including patients with left ventricular assist devices). We have an outstanding track record of high enrollment and high quality data in multicenter trials in these areas, including 11 recently completed and/or ongoing cardiovascular cellular therapy clinical trials. Our extensive experience has built expertise in trial design, patient selection, delivery techniques, and endpoint measurements including state-of-the-art imaging and surrogate endpoints. We have the distinct advantage of being one of three PACT institutions, which promotes establishment of standards and application of good manufacturing and clinical practices to the research process. With the infrastructure under this RFA, our expertise will greatly enhance the success of cell therapy protocols at other sites selected to carry out clinical trials. The clinical application of cellular therapies is built on a longstanding success of basic science at the UMN Center for Cardiovascular Repair and the Stem Cell Institute. Such approach, under the structure of this RFA, will generate scientific knowledge and address clinically relevant questions on mechanisms of cell therapies and effects on cardiovascular disease. Using the clinical sites and resources under this RFA, we will establish a bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell repository, which will be used to identify and characterize the best suitable cells, as well as the future responders to therapy. We believe we are perfectly suited to play an important role in the NHLBI cardiovascular cell therapy research network, capitalizing on our basic research skills, abilities to conduct multi-center clinical trials within an integrative network, and to disseminate knowledge.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synthetic peptides composed of short sequences within adhesion molecules, referred to as ""biomimetic peptides"", have been used to promote cell adhesion on many different types of implant biomaterials. However, our laboratory has shown that hydroxyapatite (HA) biomaterials have the ability to adsorb cell attachment factors from blood/serum, and this caused us to question whether biomimetic approaches-would be helpful on this biomaterial. We opted to explore the use of mimetic peptides of proteins which were not present in high abundance in the blood, but played a major roll in pre-osteoblast cell differentiation. Collagen is the major component of the organic phase of bone, but is not present in large quantities in the blood. Activation of the integrin receptors which bind collagen I cause downstream signaling effects which lead to an increase in osteoblastic markers. Our goal is to test the efficacy of three collagen I mimetic peptides, to see which, if any, has the ability to increase initial cell adhesion or the rate of differentiation.

Emerging evidence indicates that transcription factors expressed by functional subsets of sensory and motor neurons direct the development of selective
sensory-motor connections. One important unresolved issue is the identity of the relevant targets of the transcription factors that control motor and sensory axon growth and connectivity. The main goal of this proposal is to define the link between the transcriptional regulation of spinal motor and sensory neuron identity and the key cell surface recognition molecules that control axonal growth and target specificity in this neural circuit. Three specific aspects of motor and sensory neuron development will be addressed.
Motor neurons located within lateral motor column project their axons differentially along the dorsoventral axis of the limb, under the control of LIM homeodomain transcription factors. We will use mouse genetic methods to explore the possibility that LIM homeodomain proteins direct motor axon guidance by regulating the expression of Eph kinases and ephrins on motor axons and limb mesenchymal cells.
ETS class transcription factors regulate the trajectory and terminal axonal branching of both motor and sensory neurons, and genetic studies have revealed that ETS genes regulate semaphorin expression in motor neurons. We will use mouse genetic approaches to map the distribution, and analyze the function, of specific semaphorins and their major receptors, the plexins, in the differentiation of motor and sensory neurons, focusing on the function of these genes in sensory axonal growth and connectivity.
One difficulty in identifying relevant targets of LIM homeodomain and ETS genes has been the limitation in number of primary neurons that can be obtained from mouse embryos. To overcome this problem, we will take advantage of the ability to generate motor neurons in essentially unlimited numbers from mouse ES cells, and the finding that ES cell-derived motor neurons lack expression of many of the LIM homeodomain and ETS proteins that regulate motor axonal growth and connectivity.
ES cell derived motor neurons will therefore be used as a cellular system for DNA-based microarray screens to define and study the function of additional target genes that are activated or repressed by these transcription factors."," ",

The goal of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center SPORE in Breast Cancer is to facilitate innovative translational research in the biology, detection, prevention and treatment of breast cancer, leading eventually to elimination of this disease. Our dedicated collaborative researchers will accomplish this goal by effective integration of laboratory, epidemiologic, translational and clinical research, which will lead to changes in clinical practice that will provide innovative prevention and treatment strategies and improve outcome for patients with this disease. M.D. Anderson Cancer Center has made the elimination of breast cancer a priority by dedicating resources to establish the Breast Cancer Research Program (BCRP) whose purpose it is to support research in breast cancer. The BCRP has transcended departmental and institutional lines to form an integrated multidisciplinary research program focused on advancing the detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of breast cancer. The BCRP has made it possible to recruit new investigators to the institution and to support breast cancer research of existing faculty through their support of pilot projects, strengthening the research infrastructure, and supporting new breast cancer research initiatives. The clinicians and scientists included in this application represent multiple departments and areas of expertise. They have been selected for the SPORE program because of their ongoing interest in translational research, their current level of peer-reviewed funding relevant to this application, the quality of their research, and their commitment to work together as a team. The SPORE is led by a senior clinical investigator and a senior laboratory-based researcher, includes three main areas: research, comprised of five main projects; research support, comprised of three cores; and research development, comprised of the Developmental Research Program and the Career Development Program. The three Cores (administrative, biostatistics and data management, and tissue procurement and pathology) are led by investigators with a track record of accomplishment in their chosen field. The individual Cores will provide the support that will assure the completion of the projects. The five projects that comprise the foundation of this proposal are: 1) Determinants of response to therapy and outcomes in breast cancer patients of different ethnic backgrounds 2) Cyclin E as a novel and powerful prognosticator for breast cancer 3) Treatment of metastatic breast cancer with gene modified mesenchymal stem cells 4) PTEN deficiency and trastuzumab resistance and 5) Targeting breast cancer-specific gene therapy. Each project includes both basic and clinical Co-Leaders. Thus, each project's leadership has complementary strengths and areas of expertise that will allow us to work together in the translation of new findings to clinical therapies and screening procedures.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent compelling evidence demonstrates that sclerostin - the product of the Sost gene exclusively expressed by osteocytes in bone - antagonizes the pro-osteoblastogenic actions of Wnts and BMPs; providing a long-sought molecular means by which osteocytes regulate bone formation. Work leading to this application by the PI and collaborators demonstrated that chronic elevation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) potently decreases Sost/sclerostin expression in osteocytes in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a novel mechanism for PTH-dependent osteoblastogenesis mediated by osteocytes. Mechanical loading also increases osteoblast number; and a potential mediator of this anabolic effect is PTH related peptide (PTHrP), as its expression is increased by mechanical stimulation. Notably, Sost expression in inhibited by mechanical stimuli in vitro and by bone loading in vivo. Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing a constitutively active PTH 1 receptor (PTHR1) exclusively in osteocytes (DMP1-caPTHR1) exhibit decreased Sost expression and a remarkable increase in bone mass. Based on these lines of evidence, it is hypothesized that activation of PTHR1 signaling in osteocytes leads to a rapid and direct inhibition of Sost gene expression, which, in turn, is responsible for increased bone formation in response to systemic elevation of PTH as well as to bone loading through local increase in PTHrP. This hypothesis will be tested by a combination of in vitro studies using osteocytes generated in vitro and authentic osteocytes, and in vivo approaches using transgenic and knock out mice. Studies in Aim 1 will elucidate the signaling pathways responsible by the rapid inhibition of Sost expression by PTH and PTHrP. In Aim 2, it will be determined whether suppression of Sost expression in vitro by mechanical stimulation induced by stretching or oscillating fluid flow requires PTHR1 signaling and PTHrP; and whether the decreased sclerostin expression by bone loading is spatially related to increased PTHrP and increased bone formation using the model of ulna loading in mice. In Aim 3, the consequences of PTHR1 activation or deletion in osteocytes in vivo will be established by complementary transgenic and knock out approaches. It will be also examined whether the osteogenic response induced by PTH elevation or loading, or the high bone mass phenotype of DMP1- caPTHRI mice are reversed, or at least ameliorated, by Sost overexpression or by blocking the Wnt signaling pathway. Furthermore, it will be established whether the reduction in Sost expression and the osteoblastogenic response to PTH or mechanical loading are abrogated in mice in which the PTHR1 is knocked out specifically in osteocytes (DMP1-10kb-Cre/PTHR1 mice). These studies will advance understanding of the control of bone formation by osteocytes and will elucidate the contribution of these cells to the osteoblastogenic actions of PTH, PTHrP, and mechanical stimuli. We expect that this work will provide opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic approaches leading to bone anabolism through actions on osteocytes.

Description (provided by applicant): This proposal is to promote the initiation and the development of a multi-disciplinary, thematic Center of Excellence in Diabetes and Obesity Research at the University of Louisville. The primary objective and the central focus of the Center are to enable, promote, and support scientific research related to the cardiovascular causes and consequences of diabetes and obesity. The second major aim of program is to provide mentoring and guidance to junior investigators in the Center, with the overall goal of discovering new tierapies for the treatment and prevention of diabetes and obesity. Specific objectives of the program are to: [1) Build and develop a thematic multi-disciplinary research center focused on diabetes and obesity research; (2) Develop basic and clinical understanding of the molecular mechanisms of diabetes and obesity and how they contribute to the burden of cardiovascular disease (3) Expand and bridge on-going research programs to integrate current expertise into a thematically coherent program (4) Promote collaborative interactions to build complementary individual and multi-investigator research projects; (6) Foster research careers of junior investigators leading to their development as independent principal investigators; (7) Build upon our existing research capabilities and core facilities to provide the state-of-the-art infrastructure support; (8) Develop a nationally-competitive program that will attract the best clinical cardiology fellows, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and new faculty; and most importantly to discover new and effective means for preventing and treating diabetes and obesity. The five related projects of junior investigators for the first phase of the Center are to: (1) delineate the contribution of oxidative stress to hyperglycemic injury and test whether antioxidant interventions prevent vascular injury in diabetes; (2) to investigate whether hyperglycemia impairs the cardiac reparative potential of mesenchymal stem cells and whether transplantation of stem cells with greater potential for cardiac repair will result in greater improvement of function in diabetic hearts following infarction; (3) delineate the mechanisms contributing to premature senescence and death of cardiac progenitor cells leading to non-ischemic diabetic cardiomyopathy; (4) examine whether hyperglycemic stimulation of foam cell formation is mediated by ER stress and the unfolded protein response and if drug that act as chemical chaperone ameliorate accelerated atherogenesis in diabetic animals; and (5) identify the regulation of high glucose-triggered inflammatory signaling (NF-KB activation) by specific micro RNAs. These investigations will be supported by establishing state-of-the-art core facilities in confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, cardiovascular pathology, animal models and imaging and function. We believe that a Center focused on diabetes and obesity will add to the academic success of the University and will have a positive impact on the field of diabetes and obesity research in the nation.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  One of the most important interventions for osteoporosis is prevention of bone loss. Regarding prevention strategies, the main emphasis has been on dietary calcium intake, however calcium by itself has limited efficacy. Thus, any component that can improve calcium's effect on bone mass can improve bone health significantly. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) may be a good candidate for controlling osteoporosis based on the observation that CLA reduces body fat while increasing lean mass along with total ash. However, the reported effects of CLA on bone mass have not been consistent. We hypothesized that the inconsistency of CLA with regard to bone mass is due to differences in dietary calcium content. The long term goal of this research is to obtain a systematic understanding of how dietary CLA delivered along with dietary calcium can improve bone mass, eventually leading to their use in preventing osteoporosis. The objective of this R21 application is to identify the effect of calcium and ability of CLA to increase calcium's effect on prevention of osteoporosis. Two hypotheses to be tested are (1) CLA improves calcium's effect on bone mass during a bone loss period, and (2) CLA enhances bone mass by improving bone formation while reducing bone marrow adiposity. The rationale for the proposed research is that information from this proposed research will serve as the basis of clinical trials, which can provide critical information regarding the use of CLA supplementation along with calcium for the prevention of osteoporosis. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to that part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing knowledge that will potentially help to reduce human diseases. Based on preliminary data, these hypotheses will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: (1) Determine the interaction between CLA and calcium during a period of bone loss; and (2) Determine key molecular mechanisms of CLA on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. Under the first aim, the interaction between CLA and dietary calcium in ovariectomized mice will be established along with calcium homeostasis and bone physiology to understand the mechanism of interaction between CLA and calcium. Under the second aim, the key molecular mechanisms of CLA on bone marrow adipocyte and bone formation will be identified by two separate approaches; the effects of CLA on bone marrow adipocyte formation (adipogenesis), and on bone formation (osteoblastogenesis) in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. This approach is innovated because it uses two functional ingredients' interaction along with bone marrow stem cell differentiation to understand and apply knowledge for prevention of osteoporosis. The Public Health relevance of this project is that, by identifying any dietary components that can improve calcium's benefit on bone health will have a significant impact on reduction and/or prevention of osteoporosis that can lead to an improved quality of life, particularly in the elderly.   
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass, with the elderly particularly susceptible, and it affects the quality of life as well as increasing mortality, due to complications. A unique prevention strategy by co-treatment of conjugated linoleic acid and calcium can potentially be a very useful tool for preventing the development of osteoporosis, leading to improved quality of life particularly in the elderly.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endometriosis shares many of the hallmarks of cancer, including metastatic potential, dysregulated growth, and angiogenesis. Preliminary studies in our laboratory and others have shown that lysyl oxidase (LOX) and lysyl oxidase like 1 (LOXL1) gene expression is increased in endometrioitic lesions from patients and in an animal model of disease. Lysyl oxidases are a family of extracellular amine oxidases, which mediate the formation of insoluble collagen and elastin in the extracellular matrix. In addition to this role, lysyl oxidases have been ascribed roles in cell growth regulation, differentiation and cell migration. Recently, LOX isoforms have been identified as new players in the regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a mechanism whereby cancer cells become migratory and invasive. LOX isoforms have been shown to cooperate with the transcription factor Snail to downregulate E-cadherin expression, an important determinant of the invasion process of epithelial tumors, via interactions with the well-conserved C-terminal end. LOX expression has been correlated to increased in vitro invasion capacity of human breast cancer cells. Specifically, this study aims to investigate whether lox's isoforms (LOX and LOXL1) exert a growth- regulatory, invasiveness-promoting role in endometrial cells. The main hypothesis driving this proposal is that increased levels of LOX and LOXL1 results in a reduction in the expression of E-cadherin via interactions with Snail, which promotes the highly invasive, metastatic phenotype that characterizes endometriotic cells. We also hypothesize that the expression of LOX and LOXL1 is normally regulated during the menstrual cycle by estradiol and progesterone. To test these hypotheses, first we will determine the basal pattern of expression of LOX and LOXL1 in human endometrial cells and their regulation by steroid hormones (Specific Aim #1). To determine whether upregulation of LOXs plays a role in growth and invasive potential of endometrial cells, we will transfect human endometrial cell lines with LOX and LOXL1 genes and measure proliferation, cell migration, and increased expression of genes involved in the metastatic process (Specific Aim #2). In Specific Aim #3, we will determine if LOX and LOXL1 expression activate Snail to downregulate E-cadherin expression and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transitions (EMT) in human endometrial stromal and epithelial cells. This knowledge is important to understand how endometrial cells are able to survive, grow in the peritoneum and metastasize to other organs, causing a painful, poorly understood disease known as endometriosis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad long-term goal of the proposed work is to understand regulated alternative splicing in mammals. Many important questions remain to be answered in this area of RNA biology: What is the full encyclopedia of cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that regulate splicing? How are alternative decisions coordinated to create networks of co-regulated transcripts? What are the molecular mechanisms by which exons are activated or silenced? How do mammals use these mechanisms to create tissue, organ and state-specific regulation of splicing? In this proposal we focus our study on the alternative splicing events that lead to the production of the IIIb and IIIc isoforms of the fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR2). The choice between these isoforms is tightly regulated during development and is altered during prostate cancer progression. In order to understand this alternative splicing decision, and by analogy many other like-decisions, we propose the following three aims: Specific aim no. 1: Characterization of the silencing of FGFR2 exon Illb. We have identified the cis-elements required for exon IIIb silencing and we have identified PTB as a trans-acting factor critical for this silencing. Here we propose to complete the characterization of the trans-acting factors that mediated this effect. We begin with a global analysis of PTB function to discover exons that may be silenced similarly to exon Illb. In the case of FGFR2, PTB does not act alone, however, and we intend to identify other trans-acting factors that collaborate with it to mediate silencing. Finally we propose to finish ongoing studies that examine exon IIIb silencing in tissues and organs. Specific aim no. 2: Characterization of the mechanism for FGFR2 exon choice in epithelial cells. We propose to complete the characterization of trans-acting factors and to unravel the mechanism by which these activate exon Illb and repress exon IIIc in epithelial cells. We will focus on the role of homologues of the FOX-1 protein, which can activate exon Illb and repress exon IIIc. Specific aim no. 3: Identification and characterization of cis-elements and trans-acting, factors that mediate activation of exon IIIc in mesenchymal cells. We will characterize the ISE required for exon IIIc inclusion. We will identify the trans-acting factors required for this inclusion using conventional biochemical methods and a new screen using siRNA libraries and fluorescence-based reporters of alternative splicing.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cell elongation, either due to spread or stretch, induces lung embryonic mesenchymal cells to follow a myogenic pathway [1-3].  Using these systems we identified by suppressive subtraction hybridization (SSH) two similar stretch-responsive factors, which we referred to as tension-induced/inhibited proteins (TIPs) -1 and -3.  A third isoform of intermediate Mf/, TIP-2, was identified in the GenBank, hut it was not present in the lung.  A Genomic BLAST search indicated that the three TIPs were originated by alternative splicing from a single gene. Immunohistochemical studies and tagging with green fluorescence protein (GFP) demonstrated that TIPs translocate between nucleus and cytoplasm.  TIPs display signature motifs characteristic of nuclear receptor coregulators and chromatin remodeling enzymes. Functional studies encompassing overexpression of TIPs and gene silencing using small interfering RNAs (siRNA) indicated that TIP-1 and -3 are involved in the cell's selection between the myogenic and adipogenic pathways. TIP- 1, induced by stretch, promotes myogenesis while TIP-3, inhibited by tension initiates adipogenesis. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that TIPs may act through a mechanism of chromatin remodeling.  Since the lung has bronchial smooth muscle (SM), interstitial myofibroblasts and lipofibroblasts, we hypothesize that the development of these cell types is determined at least in part by TIPs. The specific aims of this project will be: Aim 1.  To determine whether modulation of TIP-1 and TIPS alters bronchial SM, myofibroblasts and lipofibroblasts development in lung organ cultures and organotypic cultures.  Aim 2. To elucidate the transcription factors that are activated by TIP-1 and TIP-3 and whether gene acetylation, methylation or both are involved in TIP-induced transcription activation.  Aim 3. To identify the histone(s) that bind(s) to TIPs and to determine the TIP motifs that are required for histone-TIP binding.  Bronchial and vascular SM, myofibroblasts and lipofibroblasts are essential components of the lung.  These cells participate in multiple physiological processes and however very little is known about their development and the molecular mechanisms involved in their genesis.  The studies proposed in this application will provide therefore novel information on how the myogenic and adipogenic fates are determined in the embryonic lung at the cellular and molecular level.

countries, consuming an estimated $254 billion annually in the V.S.. Engineering of natural musculoskeletal
tissues represents a promising new approach to expand the range of conditions that can be effectively
treated. This proposal focuses on development of a new approach for regenerating natural skeletal tissues,
with an emphasis on temporally controlling the activity of adult stem cells using protein growth factors. The
guiding hypothesis of this work is that engineered growth factors can be included into growing layers of an
inorganic matrix, resulting in sequential growth factor delivery upon material dissolution. Growth factors will
be tagged with a mineral binding sequence for inclusion into calcium-based minerals, and subsequent matrix
dissolution will enable sequential delivery. Delivery of each growth factor will be designed to elicit a distinct
mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) response, allowing for temporal control over early generation of new bone
tissue. In a first demonstration of the utility of our approach, we will release a mitogenic factor (FGF-2) and
an osteogenic factor (BMP-2) in sequence. Specific Aim 1will develop and characterize a method for
growing calcium-based minerals within a macroporous alginate hydrogel template. This approach is inspired
by natural biomineralization processes, and employs physiological processing conditions to enable inclusion
of biologically active growth factors. Specific Aim 2 will engineer growth factors tagged with a putative
mineral binding sequence for inclusion into mineral materials, and will systematically characterize growth
factor inclusion, release, and biological activity. The emphasis will be on achieving a high level of control
over release rates while maintaining biological activity. We will then use this approach to sequentially release
two growth factors that influence MSC activity: a mitogenic factor (FGF-2) and an osteogenic factor (BMP-2).
Specific Aim 3 will evaluate temporally controlled MSC activity within the mineral matrices developed in
S.A.2, focusing on optimizing the presence of functional, differentiated osteoblasts. This aim is designed to
demonstrate the utility of our approach in an application with substantial clinical significance: engineering of
functional bone tissue. The results of this aim will serve as a springboard for development of an extensive
research program focused on temporally controlling growth factor presentation to stem cells.","127553",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
This grant proposes a five year training program designed to foster the development of an independent investigative career as a physician-scientist.  The goals of this plan, in addition to completing the research summarized below, are to provide the mentorship, technical skills, laboratory management skills, and knowledge base necessary for academic independence. Pulmonary fibrosis is progressive, debilitating process for which no effective therapy exists.  The pathogenesis of fibrotic disease involves a dysfunctional repair response characterized by epithelial cell injury associated with heightened myofibroblast activity. Fibroblast/myofibroblast apoptosis is a crucial component of normal wound healing and failure of fibroblasts to undergo apoptosis results in pathologic scar formation and tissue fibrosis.  The mechanisms promoting an anti-apoptotic mesenchymal cell phenotype in fibrotic disease remain unclear.  Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) is a multifunctional cytokine that acts in a cell-type and context-specific manner.  Through stimulation of mesenchymal cell differentiation, activation, and survival, TGF-beta1 is central to the pathogenesis of fibrotic disease in most organ systems. We hypothesize that TGF-beta1 contributes to the pathogenesis of fibrotic disease by promoting an anti-apoptotic phenotype in human lung mesenchymal cells.  We propose to examine the mechanisms through which TGF-beta1 protects mesenchymal cells from apoptosis using a combination of in vitro studies to define pertinent signaling interactions and in vivo studies to define the role of these anti-apoptotic signaling pathways in the development of fibrotic lung disease.  Our specific aims are:  1) to investigate the specific molecular mechanisms by which TGF-beta1 promotes autocrine activation of the pro-survival/anti-apoptotic PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in human lung fibroblasts, 2) to investigate the role of TGF-beta1 induced PI3K/Akt and FAK activation in the modulation and prevention of fibroblast apoptosis/anoikis, and 3) to examine, in vivo, the role of fibroblast-specific Akt activation in a murine model of pulmonary fibrosis.  Collectively, these studies will provide important mechanistic insights into the cellular signaling pathways utilized by TGF-beta1 to regulate mesenchymal cell survival.

We propose to evaluate the ability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to act as vehicles for local delivery of chemopreventives in transgenic mice that develop mammary cancer. Recently, efforts to use adult-derived stem cells to deliver chemotherapeutic agents to tumor sites have shown great promise in primary and metastatic tumor models, and we propose to extend this concept to include the delivery of chemopreventative compounds. It remains untested whether a multiple drug delivery system applied in a prevention setting would inhibit mammary tumor development. We therefore propose to measure the ability of ACE-MSC expressing multiple chemopreventive agents to inhibit cancer progression, both in vitro and in vivo, using a previously characterized mouse model of breast cancer. For this purpose, we will utilize transgenic mice engineered to overexpress the growth factor, TGFa (transforming growth factor alpha), in the mammary gland. For this application we propose to engineer ACE-MSCs to express two anti-proliferative/proapoptotic molecules, interferon beta (IFN¿) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). To accomplish the goals of this application we will pursue the following two specific aims: 1) Determine the level of chemopreventive factors expressed from ACE-MSCs that is required to maximally inhibit breast tumor cell growth in vitro and, 2) Determine whether selected ACE-MSCs expressing this pair of anticancer factors can inhibit TGFa tumorigenesis. Goal: Test the ability of engineered ACE-MSCs to inhibit TGFa tumorigenesis. Hypothesis: ACE-MSC engineered to locally deliver interferon (IFNb) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) will inhibit cancer progression in mice overexpressing TGFa. Aim 1. Verify impairment of cell growth and inducement of apoptosis in vitro in mammary cancer cells co-cultured with ACE-MSC expressing IFNb and TRAIL. Aim 2. Measure the effect of administering ACE-MSC-IFN-TRAIL-td-Tomato versus ACE-MSC-td-Tomato marker gene control to NRL-TGFa mice on tumor latency, incidence, multiplicity and mammary cell turnover dynamics.

Extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading proteinases of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gene family have been implicated in the pathogenesis of breast neoplastic progression, yet also play a role in normal tissue remodeling. This project tests the hypothesis that MMPs are essential contributors to the interaction between mammary epithelial cells, the adipogenic stroma and the extracellular matdx. We have used genetic analysis in transgenic mice and mammary cultures, to show that MMPs expressed by stromal cells and mammary epithelial cells alter the cellular microenvironment in the mammary gland during development and lead to neoplastic progression. We wish to address the molecular mechanisms by which these MMPs orchestrate the cross-talk between the mesenchymal and epithelial compartments. It is now clear that altering MMP levels and activity affects the phenotype and behavior of mammary epithelial progenitor and ductal cells and stromal cells. We propose to study the structural basis of these alterations in morphogenesis, differentiation, and migratory and invasive behavior in separated and interacting populations of cells in various microenvironmental configurations in culture model and during in vivo branching morphogenesis using cells from wild type and MMP mutant mice."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
It is clear that the skin of a 2-year-old, a 20-year-old, a 50-year-old, and a 70-year-old has different physical properties, such as resiliency. The histologic structure of young, mature, and old skin is likewise clearly different. In addition to the cellular complexity of the dermis, this mesenchymal tissue is dominated and distinguished by its complex extracellular matrix. This matrix has a unique composition and organization, and its physical properties determine the overall properties of the dermis. Thus, in order to understand how skin changes as a function of age, it is necessary to determine the age-related changes in key extracellular matrix components. Because proteoglycans can affect the resiliency of a tissue, can interact with other matrix molecules, and can influence cell behavior, this proposal focuses on the major proteoglycans of skin, decorin and versican. Our data suggest that decorin and versican can serve as indicators of skin age. Hence, our working hypothesis is that the pattern of proteoglycans can be used to evaluate the age equivalence of in vitro formulations of skin. We further hypothesize that age-related changes in skin proteoglycans are involved in age-related differences in skin biology. To test this hypothesis, we propose experiments focused on the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: Detailed analysis of age-related changes in human skin proteoglycans in vivo. Specific Aim 2: Analysis of the role of age-related differences in proteoglycan catabolism in skin biology. Specific Aim 3: Application of the age-related differences in human skin proteoglycans as an indicator of the age equivalence of cultures of reconstructed human skin. With these studies, insight will be gained into the factors which regulate age-related changes in skin extracellular matrix and, hence, which contribute to the aging of skin.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     
Blood vessel replacement is a common treatment for vascular diseases. Tissue engineering is a promising approach to the fabrication of non-thrombogenic and mechanically durable vascular grafts. Our goal is to engineer bone marrow stem cells and electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds to construct tissue-engineered vascular graft (TEVG) that closely matches the composition, structure and mechanical property of native blood vessel. Bone marrow contains vascular endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSC can differentiate into a variety of cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC). We hypothesize that: (1) bone marrow stem cells can be used to derive endothelial cells (ECs) and SMCs to construct TEVGs, (2) bioactive nanofibrous scaffolds with aligned nanofibers can promote MSC differentiation, matrix remodeling and the formation of microstructure as in native vessel, and (3) mechanical loading can promote MSC differentiation, matrix remodeling and EC monolayer retention. To test our hypothesis, four Specific Aims are proposed: (1) To engineer bioactive nanofibrous scaffolds and characterize MSC-scaffold interactions; (2) To determine MSC differentiation and matrix remodeling in TEVG in response to mechanical loading; (3) To construct EC monolayer in TEVG using EPCs and determine the effect of flow on EC remodeling; (4) To determine the remodeling and patency of small-diameter TEVGs in vivo. The nanofibers in the tubular scaffolds will be aligned in the circumferential direction to mimic the matrix alignment in native blood vessels and guide the MSC alignment. RGD peptide and TGF-p will be conjugated to the nanofibers to promote matrix remodeling and MSC differentiation into SMC. Mechanical loading will be applied to the tubular scaffolds to further enhance matrix remodeling and MSC differentiation. Bone marrow derived ECs will be cultured as monolayer on the luminal surface of TEVG, and will be pre-conditioned by fluid shear stress. The mechanical property and structure of the TEVGs will be determined. Bypass surgery will be performed in animal model to determine the continued remodeling and patency of small TEVGs. Manufacturing-related issues such as Good Manufacturing Practices, biomarker monitoring, storage and caling-up will be addressed. The accomplishment of this project will lead to the development of innovative technologies to engineer stem cells and nanofibrous scaffolds for the construction of small TEVGs.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to develop novel and improved cord blood expansion strategies and to test in a clinically relevant large animal model whether these strategies can overcome current limitations of cord blood transplantation. Despite some important advantages of cord blood, such as rapid accessibility and a low risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) even in a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched setting, a major limitation of cord blood transplantation has been the limited number of cord blood cells available, particularly for adult patients. Thus, delayed engraftment and infectious complications have remained significant concerns with cord blood transplantation even with the recently described transplantation of two partially matched cord blood units. Cord blood expansion has been proposed to improve engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution. However, expansion strategies using cytokines only have so far not resulted in significant improvements in cord blood engraftment in clinical studies. The use of stem cell self-renewal genes has been proposed, and studies in the mouse have shown that overexpression of the transcription factor HOXB4 can result in a dramatic expansion of cord blood and adult stem cells. We have studied the use of HOXB4 for stem cell self-renewal and expansion in a nonhuman primate transplantation model. Using a competitive repopulation assay we directly compared engraftment of marrow-derived CD34+ cells expanded for up to 12 days with and without retrovirally expressed HOXB4. We found that engraftment, in particular short-term engraftment, was significantly higher with HOXB4-transduced / expanded CD34+ cells compared to cells expanded without HOXB4 under otherwise identical conditions. HOXB4 overexpression also resulted in a marked expansion of nonhuman primate cord blood cells. Thus, we propose in the current application to study HOXB4-mediated cord blood expansion and evaluate in a nonhuman primate transplantation model whether this strategy can result in improved engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution. We propose to 1) optimize HOXB4-mediated cord blood expansion in vitro using retrovirally expressed HOXB4, 2) evaluate improved expansion / transplantation strategies in a nonhuman primate cord blood transplantation model, and 3) determine whether HOXB4-mediated expansion can be achieved with a novel TAT-HOXB4 fusion protein. Studying these strategies in a clinically relevant nonhuman primate model will allow for an efficient evaluation of safety and efficacy and facilitate a rapid translation of our findings to clinical cord blood expansion / transplantation protocols.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
As a physician-scientist in the field of nephrology, I have a strong interest in development and disease in the kidney. My long-term career goals are to understand cellular and molecular events in kidney development and translate this into clinically relevant therapeutics for acute kidney injury. A second goal for my career is to help elucidate the pathogenesis of heritable kidney diseases, such as polycystic diseases. Toward these goals, I have proposed a project that focuses on understanding the dynamics of cell-cell adhesion and organ morphogenesis in the developing kidney using a mouse model of polycystic disease. My research proposal, entitled ""The role of p120 catenin in metanephric kidney development"", is constructed to provide a framework to achieve my goals. My preliminary data shows that newborn mice lacking p120ctn in nephrons develop kidney cysts and renal hypoplasia. I have proposed three specific aims to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved. First, I will test the hypothesis that loss of p120 catenin results in polycystic kidneys due to an alteration of cellular proliferation, apoptosis or cell polarity. This will be accomplished by biochemical and histological methods in mice lacking p120 catenin from nephron precursors. Employing similar methods, I also will test the hypothesis that loss of p120 catenin results in renal hypoplasia due to reduced nephron formation resulting from a defect in mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition during development. Second, I hypothesize that p120 catenin regulates cadherin levels and additional known intracellular signaling pathways, such as Rho family GTPases and NF(B signaling. I will test this using mouse genetics, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry and quantitative PCR. Third, I hypothesize that p120 catenin may regulate novel signaling pathways in the kidney that have not yet been elucidated. I propose to perform comparative gene expression profiling using microarrays to elucidate novel signaling pathways. Together this proposal is designed to complement my prior laboratory experiences and provide me with the technical and intellectual tools to become an independent investigator.  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Defining the mechanisms of p120ctn's role in kidney development is important, not only because it will help elucidate the normal mechanisms of cell adhesion and epithelial tubulogenesis, but also because it may shed light on cystic disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, identification of the molecules and pathways that underlie metanephric development may increase understanding of renal regeneration and repair and may lead to improved strategies for enhanced recovery.

Currently, there is extraordinary enthusiasm for the development of cell-based therapies for diseases resulting from ischemic damage to the myocardium. Rapid advances have been made in animal models and preliminary clinical trials suggest that cardiac function in acute and chronic heart disease may be improved. Currently the bone marrow remains as a highly promising source of precursor cells for cardiac repair. Our group has been involved in collaboration with Osiris Therapeutics in developing bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for the use of cellular cardiomyoplasty, and the results of this work have led to the upcoming initiation of the first clinical trial of this cell type for humans with myocardial infarction. In addition, cardiac stem cells have now been identified that can be amplified in culture as a source of cells for cardiac repair. This proposal
is based upon extensive basic and preclinical data supporting the value of both MSCs and cardiac stem cells (CSCs) for cellular cardiomyoplasty. A major strength of the approach is our ability to prepare adequate numbers of cardiac stem cells from biopsy specimens for use in therapeutic applications. The approach is three-fold with substantial synergies. First, in Project 1 MSCs will be explored in clinical trials of humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy based on an existing extensive pre-clinical database, an established safety record in humans, and already-planned clinical trials for patients with acute myocardial infarction. Second, we will concurrently in Project 2 continue characterizing CSCs obtained from humans and perform relevant preclinical experiments. Finally, based on the substantial experience obtained in Project 1 with delivery techniques and efficacy monitoring developed, and the cellular methods perfected in Project 2, we will perform clinical trials of CSCs in Project 3. Together, this
program will have the capability of performing highly-relevant and clinically informative trials that will be guided and refined by the latest advances in basic cell biology."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tubulointerstitial fibrosis, a common endpoint outcome of a wide range of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) that progress to end-stage renal failure, is preceded by activation of the a-smooth muscle actin- positive myofibroblasts, the principal effector cells that are responsible for the over-production of extracellular matrix components. This resubmission of a competitive renewal application is a continuation of our long-term efforts to elucidate the origins, activation process and fate of renal myofibroblasts in renal fibrogenesis. Studies in previous project period of this application suggest that myofibroblasts may originate from two major sources: from interstitial fibroblasts via a phenotypic activation and from tubular epithelial cells via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this renewal application, we propose to investigate the molecular mechanism and signal pathways leading to EMT and fibroblast activation. The central hypotheses to be tested are that: 1) transcriptional inhibitors Id1 and Id3 promote tubular epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), via inducing tubular epithelial dedifferentiation and via potentiating renal inflammation; 2) tPA acts as a profibrotic cytokine that promotes the survival and proliferation of interstitial fibroblasts and their myofibroblastic activation. These hypotheses will be addressed by three specific aims at the whole animal, cellular and molecular levels, respectively. Aim 1 is designed to investigate the regulation and function of transcriptional inhibitor Id proteins in mediating tubular EMT and renal inflammation. Aim 2 is to investigate the role of tPA in interstitial myofibroblast activation and to dissect the signaling pathway leading to its action. Aim 3 is to investigate the role of tPA in fibroblast and myofibroblast survival and proliferation. These studies will provide fundamental and important insights into understanding the activation mechanisms of myofibroblasts from both tubular epithelial cells and interstitial fibroblasts. Resolution of these fundamental issues will not only provide mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of chronic renal fibrosis, but also offers unique opportunities for designing rational strategies for the treatment of this devastating disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE It is estimated that up to 11% of the US adult population has some degree of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and delaying the progression of CKD is still unsolved problem. The studies proposed in this application promises to provide important insights into understanding the origins, activation and fate of renal matrix-producing myofibroblasts in the pathogenesis of CKD. Resolution of these fundamental issues may offer unique opportunities for designing rational strategies for the treatment of human CKD.

lineages.
This project will result in a significant improvement in our understanding of how the developmental
status of differentiated cells can be altered. Reprogramming the genome from a somatic cell to a
pluripotent state would be useful to generate patient-specific ES cells, thus overcoming the problem
of tissue rejection resulting from genetic mismatches between donor and recipient. Perhaps more
importantly, understanding how to reprogram differentiated cells to entirely new fates may ultimately
lead to novel regenerative therapies that act on patients' endogenous cells in the absence of cell
transplantation. This project represents an important early step in that direction."," ",

diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and several types of cancers. In contrast, lipoatrophy, the lack of adipose
tissue, is also associated with diabetes and various metabolic abnormalities. Thus, understanding the
cellular and molecular basis that regulates adipocyte differentiation is necessary to develop comprehensive
therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of these disorders. The canonical Wnt/B-catenin
pathway has been shown to inhibit adipogenesis while maintaining a dividing preadipoctye state through
overexpression studies. However, its physiological importance remains to be elucidated. We reported a
novel B-catenin-associated antagonist, termed Chibby (Cby). Cby is a nuclear protein that is conserved
throughout evolution. We showed that Cby interacts with the C-terminal activation domain of B-catenin and
represses B-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation by competing with Lef-1. We further demonstrated
that loss of Cby function leads to hyperactivation of the pathway in Drosophila. To gain insights into the
function of Cby during vertebrate development as well as in human disease, we have created Cby-null
(Cby-/-) mice. Unexpectedly, these mice exhibit reduced adiposity. Using cultured 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, we
found that Cby protein levels increase during adipogenesis. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Cby causes
spontaneous differentiation, and conversely, Cby RNAi almost completely blocks adipogenesis of 3T3-L1
cells. These preliminary data strongly argue that Cby is an essential proadipogenic factor. The long-term
goal of this application is to elucidate the role of Cby in adipose tissue development. We propose to analyze
adipose tissues in Cby-/- mice, investigate adipogenic potential of Cby-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts in
vitro, and chracterize Cby using preadipocyte and pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells. Our research offers
hope that blocking Cby's activity may be an effective therapy for obesity and its associated disorders.","297737",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human white adipose tissue (WAT) contains multipotent mesodermal progenitors, as deduced by several investigators who assayed the differentiation potential of the whole tissue, and, therefore, appears as an attractive, convenient, cheap and abundant source of therapeutic stem cells. In the present pilot study, we embark on the direct identification of these fat tissue-resident stem cells. Our general strategy is directly inspired by recent observations that include our own, showing that vascular endothelial cells and related mural cells, or pericytes, can be the source of early progenitors in the hematopoietic system, skeletal muscle and pancreas. The hypothesis we test in the present project is that this also applies to adipose tissue. To this end, endothelial cells and pericytes will be sorted to homogeneity, by flow cytometry, from the human WAT vascular stroma and introduced into assay systems, in culture and in immunodeficient mice, in order to document their ability to give rise to adipocytes, myofibers and hematopoietic cells. Understanding the differentiation potential of individual cell subsets sorted from a simple tissue such as WAT will be a step toward the identification of the elusive multipotent stem cells - mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC) or muscle-derived stem cells (MDSC) - shown in the past few years to reside in adult organs. Fat tissue contains elusive stem cells that, if better characterized, could be used to repair diseased organs, for instance the muscle, bones and even the heart. Fat aspiration, which is commonly performed in cosmetic surgery, is a safe and easy procedure that could provide sufficient amounts of such therapeutic stem cells. These should be purified, in some instances stimulated in culture, then transplanted into the tissue to be repaired. We are in the process of identifying the localization and molecular characteristics of multipotent stem cells within human fat tissue. This project will further document the properties of these cells and lead to define methods for their prospective purification and development into diverse human functional tissues.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The global objective of this research is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue remodeling during growth, differentiation and development in mouse mammary gland, and to gain insights into how this process goes awry in pathologic disorders, including cancer. A central issue in achieving this goal is to understand how the stromal microenvironment regulates the invasive behavior of normal epithelia during pubertal development and how mammary luminal and myoepithelial cells interact to form a stable ductal tree. Extracellular matrix (ECM)-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are expressed in the stroma. They play a role in normal tissue remodeling during development and also contribute to the pathogenesis of tumor progression. The present proposal addresses the mechanisms by which these stromal MMPs orchestrate the cross talk between mesenchymal and epithelial compartments. The goal for this proposal is to dissect, in molecular and cell biological detail, how MMPs affect branching morphogenesis through their ability to orchestrate the stromal microenvironment of the breast. The project will use a toolbox of genetically modified mice and mammary cells, organotypic cell culture models and in vivo transplantation systems to interrogate these models and determine the critical substrates of MMPs, what signaling pathways are regulated by MMPs and how intercellular communication is affected by MMPs. The organotypic cultures will be analyzed for growth, morphogenesis, differentiation, and invasive behavior using a combination of live cell imaging, biochemistry and cell biology. In vivo analysis will utilize genetically modified mammary glands and orthotopic transplants of mammary epithelial cells transduced with wild type and mutated MMPs, their inhibitors and substrates. The role of MMPs in fine-tuning intercellular communication during branching morphogenesis will be studied with emphasize on myoepithelial cells. The study will focus on candidate substrates in the Wnt pathway for MMP3/stromelysin, and how their cleavage by MMPs affects signaling in the mammary epithelium. By dissecting how these signaling pathways operate in balancing stem cell activation, proliferation and differentiation and the mechanical environment in the pubertal mammary gland, the applications to breast cancer should continue to unfold. These experiments will give insights into how misregulation of MMPs directly leads to the development of breast cancer. An understanding of how MMPs function in the normal tissue and how disruption of their function promotes neoplasia is necessary to achieve the long-term goal of finding cures for breast cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women and is the most common cancer among women. This study addresses an important aspect of women's health, of how matrix metalloproteinases regulate normal and neoplastic mammary gland function. The approaches used in this project will elucidate how MMPs alter the structural microenvironment, and how this influences the critical responses of growth and invasion in normal and abnormal mammary gland epithelium and stroma. These studies may form the basis of intervention and therapy in breast cancer, potentially in the premalignant lesions.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal will test the hypothesis that upregulation of the HEF1 gene in tumors is an important contributing factor for cancer metastasis, based on the ability of elevated HEF1 to drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).  In EMT, cells lose epithelial cell characteristics, become increasingly motile, and acquire the ability to invade surrounding tissue, enabling metastasis.  A series of studies within the past year have nominated the HEF1 protein as an essential switch for pro-metastatic behavior in tumors.  These studies have identified HEF1 as a component of a small ""signature"" of genes upregulated in metastasizing breast adenocarcinomas, shown that HEF1 is important for glioblastoma invasiveness, and determined that upregulation of HEF1 occurred in more than 30% of metastatic melanomas and was critical for the metastatic process.  Since our group first described the HEF1 gene in 1996, we have worked continually to dissect the signaling role of this protein.  This work has demonstrated a central role for HEF1 as a scaffolding protein or ""hub"" that enhances and coordinates the activity of multiple signaling cascades that promote cancer progression.  In this proposal, we will address two basic questions: 1) How does absence or elevation of HEF1 overexpression condition classic EMT/metastatic responses, including expression of E-cadherin? and 2) Is elevated expression of HEF1 an important determinant of breast cancer metastasis?  In specific experiments to answer these questions, Aim 1 will use mechanistic, cell-based assays to investigate how HEF1 regulates EMT.  We will test the hypothesis that HEF1 promotes EMT by directly controlling the ability of E-cadherin to form stable structures at adherens junctions, and determine whether HEF1 is an essential intermediate in TGF-¿ or ErbB2-induced EMT.  Aim 2 will use genetically defined HEF1-/- mice to test the hypothesis that the ability to elevate HEF1 expression contributes significantly to breast cancer metastasis.  We will cross HEF1-/- mice to two strains of transgenic mice (MMTV-PyVT and MMTV-neu) that develop primary breast tumors and lung metastases, and determine whether absence of HEF1 limits metastasis, and conditions TGF-¿ and ErbB2-related signaling in tumor cells.  Finally, Aim 3 will ask if elevated HEF1 predicts a metastatic profile in human breast tumors.

osteoclast number, and increased adipocyte number in the marrow. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) give rise
to both osteoblasts and adipocytes, and MSC lineage allocation is altered in aging. MSC lineage allocation is
controlled by diverse intracellular signals, cell-cell interactions and the bone microenvironment. The most
abundant non-collagen matrix protein in the bone microenvironment is the matricellular glycoprotein
osteonectin (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine, SPARC; BM-40). In the skeleton, osteonectin promotes
osteoblast differentiation, suppresses adipogenesis, and regulates the balance between bone formation and
resorption in response to PTH treatment. It is highly expressed early in osteoblastic differentiation, but its
expression decreases as the cells acquire characteristics of mature osteoblasts. In contrast, osteonectin
transcript levels change little during osteoblastic differentiation, indicating regulation at the level of translation.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that mediate translational repression by interacting with the
3¿ untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs. We found that miR-29a and -29c act on the osteonectin 3¿ UTR
and mediate translational repression in committed osteoblasts. We hypothesize that miR-29a and -29c
regulate osteoblastic differentiation. Importantly, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 3¿ UTR of
osteonectin gene are associated with bone density in humans, and these SNPs modulate 3¿ UTR function.
Since osteonectin is critical for normal bone remodeling and response to bone anabolic PTH therapy, the goal
of our work is to understand post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating its expression in the skeleton. We will
1. determine how human osteonectin 3¿ UTR SNPs modulate protein levels during osteoblastic differentiation
in vitro; 2. determine the activity of human osteonectin 3¿ UTR haplotypes in vivo, using mice carrying knock-in
mutations of the human UTR and 3. determine the role of miR-29 in osteoblast differentiation in vitro. These
studies will fill a substantial void in the knowledge of key mechanisms regulating bone mass. In addition, the
information we acquire could be applied to other diseases in which osteonectin is thought to play a role in
pathology, such as obesity and cancer. This proposal contains basic and translational components, and we
will obtain information relevant to both basic science and clinical studies.","319433",

During the previous funding period
it was found that activation of PPARy caused bone loss by stimulating the development of adipocytes at the
expense of osteoblasts from their common multipotential mesenchymal stem cell progenitor, and by
increasing the apoptosis of preosteoblasts. Oxidized lipid ligands of PPARy are generated by the actions of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or 12,15-lipoxygenase (Alox15) on linoleic and arachidonic acid.
Increased Alox15 expression has been associated with decreased bone mass and strength, and evidence
leading to the development of this application revealed an increase in the level of oxidized lipids in murine
bone between 8 and 31 months of age. These changes were associated with loss of bone mass and
strength, decreased bone formation rate, increased osteoblast and osteocyte apoptosis, and elevated levels
of PPARy and Alox15. Reversal of age-related bone loss has been achieved by daily administration of
parathyroid hormone (PTH), but the efficacy of this therapy is variable for unknown reasons. In view of
evidence that the anabolic effect of PTH is due at least in part to attenuation of osteoblast apoptosis, PTH
may reverse the increased osteoblast apoptosis seen in aged mice. The hormone may also increase
osteoblast production by inhibiting PPARy activity. The above observations form the basis of the hypothesis
that PPARy is increasingly activated by oxidized lipids with advancing age, secondary to elevated levels of
ROS and Alox15. Hence, age-related bone loss is due, at least in part, to increased adipogenesis at the
expense of osteoblastogenesis and increased apoptosis of osteoblast progenitors. As a corollary, PTH is a
rational and especially efficacious treatment for age-related osteoporosis because it counteracts the PPARymediated
adverse effects of oxidized lipids and ROS on bone. To test this hypothesis, the role of oxidized
lipids generated by Alox15 in age-related bone loss will be examined in vivo by pharmacologic and genetic
manipulation of the enzyme and subsequent measurement of bone mass, architecture, strength, osteoblast
apoptosis, and bone formation rate (Aim 1). In addition, in vitro studies will be done to distinguish between
PPARy-dependent and PPARy-independent effects of Alox15-derived oxidized lipids on osteoblast
progenitors (Aim 2). Finally, studies will be performed to investigate whether intermittent administration of
PTH to aged mice will specifically reverse the negative skeletal effects of increased oxidized lipids and ROS
and thereby increase bone mass (Aim 3). This work should advance knowledge of how the elderly develop
osteoporosis and bone fractures. Furthermore, it should provide a better understanding of how to optimize
the treatment of this condition.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a training program for the development of an academic career in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation. The principal investigator (PI) is a junior faculty of the Bone Marrow Transplant Program at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center. The PI will expand her scientific skills through training as participant of a Physician-Scientist mentorship program. Dr. Claudio Anasetti, Chief of the Bone Marrow Transplantation Program and an authority in hematopoietic cell transplantation, will mentor the principal investigator's scientific development. In addition, an advisory committee of highly regarded medical scientists will provide scientific and career advice. Prolonged thrombocytopenia after high dose chemotherapy is a problem associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The proposed research will provide preclinical data on novel strategies to improve platelet reconstitution post transplant. Dr. Perez proposes to study the thrombopoietic role of in vitro generated megakaryocytes in a xenotransplantation model for human megakaryocytopoiesis. In vivo approaches to improve their function with chemokines and/or accessory cells will be studied. Research on apoptotic mechanism affecting engraftment of cycling HSC that may translate on improved homing, engraftment and differentiation of in vitro cytokine stimulated HSC to generate megakaryocytes will be addressed. In addition, molecular studies of genes that may regulate megakaryocytopoiesis and participate in platelet recontitution will be studied. Moffitt Cancer Center has an extremely nurturing environment and provides an ideal setting for training physician scientists. Interactions between scientists, physician/scientists and clinical investigators maximizes the potential of the PI to establish a successful independent research program on hematopoietic stem cell biology and transplantation.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adult skeleton is a dynamic system. Bone is continuously being formed and resorbed, starting in the embryo and continuing throughout adult life. This remodeling of bone is accomplished by precise coordination between two cell types: osteoblasts, which deposit the calcified bone matrix; and osteoclasts, which resorb bone. The sequence is always the same - activation of osteoclast precursors and osteoclastic bone resorption, followed by osteoblastic bone formation to repair the defects. Therefore, migration of osteoprogenitors to the resorptive site in response to osteoclastic bone resorption is an initial and central step in the coupling mechanism. However, the cellular and hormonal mechanisms responsible for mediating the coupling process are still not known.   
  
We have demonstrated that bone resorption-conditioned medium induces migration of MSCs. Neutralizing anti-TGF-b1 antibodies and depletion of TGF-b1 from the conditioned medium almost completely inhibit the migration whereas neutralizing antibodies to other potential coupling factors do not have such a dramatic effect. Conditioned medium from culture of osteoclasts with bone contains active TGF-b1, whereas conditioned medium from culture of osteoclasts or their precursors in the absence of bone contains the latent inactive form of TGF-b1 only. In characterization of the mechanisms involved in TGF-b1-induced cell migration, we have identified a novel RhoA signaling pathway that enhances cell adhesion and a Smad- dependent pathway that drives cell migration. The effects of inhibiters of RhoA and Smad signaling were tested in vivo by injection in rat tibia. Injection of the RhoA inhibitor, which promotes migration in our in vitro assays, stimulated bone formation in vivo, whereas injection of an inhibitor of Smad signaling, which inhibits cell migration in vitro, decreased bone formation in vivo. Taken together, our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that TGF-b1 induces migration of MSCs in response to bone resorption. Therefore, we hypothesize that TGF-b1, released and activated during osteoclastic bone resorption, induces migration of osteoprogenitors to bone resportive site as the primary coupling factor. We will 1) confirm that TGF-b1 released during osteoclastic bone resorption induces migration of MSCs with the use of TGF-b1 knockout mice and CED TGF-b1 mutants; 2) characterize the mechanism of TGF-b-induced migration of MSCs; 3) examine the mechanisms of TGF-b1-induced migration of osteoprogenitors in vivo by injection of inhibitors for Rho A and Smad phosphorylation in rat tibia and analyzing CED TGF-b1 mutant transgenic mice. Ultimately, this study will lead to reveal a mechanism of coupling bone resorption and formation and improve the treatment for bone diseases with coupling disorder.

autologous cellular cardiomyoplasty. Such cardiac stem cells (CSCs) have been isolated from rodent hearts
and from human surgical specimens. We have made substantial progress in isolating and expanding these
cells from percutaneously obtained endomyocardial biopsies. When grown in suspension culture, CSCs form
self-organizing spherical clusters that display several features of differentiating cardiomyocytes. We now
propose to continue functional characterization of CSCs and cardiospheres in vitro and in vivo.
Understanding the electrophysiology of CSCs and cardiospheres may provide insights into events in cardiac
development and repair and is vital to assessing the safety and efficacy of cell transplantation. This
application seeks to elucidate the molecular and electrophysiologic phenotype at different stages of
differentiation. Previous work using mesenchymal stem cells and bone marrow cells has demonstrated
improvement of cardiac function without significant engraftment or differentiation of the injected cells into
functional cardiac myocytes. Autologous cardiac stem cells have the highest potential for engraftment and
differentiation into functional myoctes. We propose to compare engraftment and differentiation after injection
of CSCs or cardiospheres in an animal model of myocardial infarction. Cardiospheres may, by virtue of their
3-dimensional architecture, improve cell engraftment, multiplication, survival and differentiation. Clinical trials
of myoblasts, (an autologous cell type currently in clinical trials) have reported a high incidence of ventricular
arrhythmias probably secondary to lack of electrical integration of myoblasts. Our preliminary data reveals
that cardiac stem cells express Cx43 and are capable of electrical coupling with ventricular myocytes in co-
culture. Here, we plan to evaluate electrical coupling and arrhythmogenic potential of cells in vitro and in
vivo, using optical mapping, microelectrode recordings and 2-photon microscopy. Another important feature
of stem cells is their ability to secrete factors that have a beneficial effect on cardiac function. Identification of
secreted factors by stem cells may permit direct delivery of growth factors immediately after injury obviating
the need for cell expansion. We will use proteomic techniques to identify secreted factors.Given the potential
of clinical translation, this work opens up the possibility of revolutionizing the treatment of heart failure.","385973",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult cartilage is known to have little ability for repair, due primarily to a lack of active chondrogenic progenitor cells. As a result, there are limited alternatives for the treatment of osteoarthritis, most of which are targeted at the symptoms of the disease and not at a cure. Mesenchymal stem cells and cultured pre-chondrocytes isolated from a patient have the potential to be applied to the repair of cartilage if they can be delivered to the sites where needed. It is hypothesized that pre-chondrogenic cells coated with antibodies specific for cartilage matrix could be used as a method to regenerate or repair damaged cartilage. The focus of this proposal is to develop a targeting strategy for pre-chondrocytes so that these cells can be used to repair an articular cartilage defect in vivo. To achieve this goal, MSCs and pre-chondrocytes will be coated with palmitated protein G (or A [PPG/A]) and then incubated with antibodies to type II collagen or to epitopes on aggrecan molecules. These antibodies will bind to the PPNG and their antigen binding sites will be oriented outward. These cells coated with different antibodies, alone or in combination, will be tested for their ability to bind cartilage matrix on frozen sections and on explants of rabbit articular cartilage. Pre-chondrocytes will be stained with a vital fluorescent dye, coated with targeting antibodies, added to sections or explants, washed and then observed for the presence of fluorescent cells. In vitro studies will be carried out on coated cells to confirm that the coating procedure does not significantly impede the cells ability to proliferate or to differentiate into chondrocytes. Once targeting and synthesis of cartilage matrix have been demonstrated, these targeted pre-chondrocytes will be tested for their ability to repair a standard articular cartilage defect in rabbits, in vivo. The degree of repair will be assessed by histologic examination and morphometric examination of the articular cartilage defects. Experimental groups to be tested are: (1) control untreated defects, (2) targeted cell-injected, (3) PPA/g coated, and (4) untreated cell-injected. These experiments will determine if this novel cell targeting methodology effectively directs pre-chondrocytes to cartilage matrix and whether these targeted cells can contribute to the repair of damaged cartilage. The long-term goal of these studies is to develop a treatment for osteoarthritis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hallmark of type I diabetes is the loss of ¿-cells. In order to develop therapies, we need to understand how these cells can be regenerated. The goal of this proposal is to understand how ¿-cell regeneration is regulated. We have focused on PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) and shown that deletion of Pten leads to increased islet mass. We hypothesize that PTEN deficiency increases islet mass by regulating ¿-cell dynamics and plasticity. To test this hypothesis, we have set two specific aims. In Aim1, we will determine whether the effect of PTEN on islet mass is cell autonomous to ¿-cells. Two approaches will be used to test the autonomous nature of PTEN on ¿-cell regeneration. Lineage tracing using PtenloxP/loxP; RosalacZ; Rip-Cre+ mouse to investigate the role of PTEN in ¿-cell proliferation will be the first approach. Previously, we have observed that PTEN deficiency leads to increased islet mass in conjunction with an increased proliferation near the islets. In this study, we will determine whether these proliferating peri-islet cells originate from ¿-cells and whether they contribute to islet regeneration. To further test if the effect of PTEN is cell autonomous to ¿-cells, we will determine whether the effect of PTEN on ¿-cell regeneration is dependent on its role in development. To do this, we will use the PtenloxP/loxP; RosalacZ; Rip-CreER+ model that we have generated to induce Pten deletion in mature ¿-cells. In Aim2, we will investigate the mechanism for PTEN induced ¿-cell regeneration. We have observed increased mesenchymal cell formation in the Pten mutant pancreas. Since mouse ¿-cells are most likely self regenerating, it is likely that these mesenchymal cells are ¿-cells in the process of dedifferentiation as they do not express insulin. To address how PTEN regulates ¿-cell plasticity, we will investigate the role of PTEN on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ¿-cell regeneration. EMT has been suggested to be one mechanism that ¿-cells may use to regenerate. We will use lineage tracing with the PtenloxP/loxP; RosalacZ; Rip-Cre+ mouse to determine if these mesenchymal cells are indeed ¿-cells going through EMT and whether they contribute to ¿-cell regeneration. In summary, this application is focused on the mechanism of ¿-cell regeneration. The result of this study will provide a mechanistic analysis of the feasibility of targeting the PI3K/AKT signal pathway in order to treat type I diabetes. The proposed study is focused on understanding the mechanism for pancreatic ¿-cell regeneration. Stimulating ¿-cell regeneration is an important goal for developing drug treatments targeted at type I diabetes. The proposed study provides a mechanistic analysis of the role of PTEN, a key growth regulator, in ¿-cell regeneration. If the hypothesis is proven, this study will provide a molecular basis for drugs designed to target the PTEN regulated PI3K/AKT pathway in order to stimulate ¿-cell regeneration.

 Nearly 25% of all diabetic patients, with foot ulcers, will inevitably progress to major limb amputation.
Diabetic wound healing deficiencies are associated with impaired tissue level neovascularization, impaired
keratinocyte function, reduced tensile strength, and higher infection rates. While these generalized poor
wound healing defects of patients with diabetes mellitus are well established, the specific tissue level
mechanisms responsible for these wound-healing deficiencies remain poorly understood. A complex cellular
cascade mediates normal cutaneous wound healing, where all skin cells cooperate to repair and rebuild the
dermis and epidermis. But in patients with chronic wounds, these signals for cell recruitment, proliferation,
and differentiation in the wound bed are disrupted. Overall, we aim to develop new strategies for treating
chronic leg wounds by primarily identifying specific molecules, that when expressed by cells within the
wound itself, will promote healing of chronic wounds as well as fully restore skin architecture and function.
Because fibroblasts are the critical cell type for early and late wound healing, we hypothesize that, during
normal wound healing, fibroblast precursor cells are recruited from both, the resident resting pool in the skin
and the bone marrow-derived stem cell populations, which then subsequently migrate into the wound bed
and differentiateinto mature fibroblasts. To distinguish between these two cellular populations we have
developed in vivo bone marrow transplantation models, using normal and diabetic mice, and novel in vitro
three-dimensional reconstructions of human dermis, vascularized dermis, and skin, in which fibroblasts can
interact with other key cell types involved in wound healing. In these in vivo wound-healing models and in
vitro reconstructionswe will determine the extent to which bone marrow-derived fibroblasts influence wound-
healing processes including contraction of collagen, stimulation of vessel formation, re-epithelialization and
keratinocyte growth and differentiation. With the use of viral vector delivery of agonists and inhibitors, we will
test the hypothesis that growth factors, specifically PDGF-B (platelet-derived growth factor) are critical for the
activation of bone marrow-derived fibroblasts to invade into collagen, proliferate, migrate to the wound,
survive, and differentiate into long-term cellular components of the healed skin wound.","265333",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of death in the USA and results in irreversible damage to the myocardium. Recent studies suggest that cardiac function can be restored by adding new, healthy cells such as skeletal muscle myoblasts (SKMB) or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Early results of cell therapy are encouraging and indicate hemodynamic improvement; however, it is unknown if cell therapy can reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death (SCO) associated with IHD. Moreover, significant safety concerns have been raised due to reports of increased arrhythmia risk. To date, several studies suggest that the ability of transplanted cells to electrically couple with host cells is an important determinant of arrhythmia risk. In addition, augmenting the natural tissue regeneration process by enhancing stem cell homing to the site of damaged myocardium may provide further benefit. In general, we hypothesize that the ability of cell therapy to reduce arrhythmia vulnerability will be determined by its ability to enhance electrophysiological viability of the infarct zone through the engraftment of viable cells that form functional electrical connections. Therefore a major goal of this proposal is to determine the electrophysiological benefit and, thus, the antiarrhythmic consequence of cell therapy for IHD, and to optimize cell therapy by enhancement of intercellular coupling and cell homing/engraftment using gene therapy. To achieve these goals, novel optical mapping techniques and a rat model of IHD will be utilized to address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate an optical mapping system to investigate cell therapy for SCD associated with myocardial infarction (Ml) in rat. 2) Determine the mechanisms by which cell therapy provides electrophysiological benefit or detriment in hearts with Ml. 3) Establish the antiarrhythmic or proarrhythmic mechanisms associated with cell therapy for Ml in the whole heart. 4) Determine if overexpression of connexin protein (Cx40, Cx43, and Cx45) and SDF-1 (stem cell homing factor) can significantly enhance SKMB and MSC cell therapy for SCD associated with Ml. Overall, this study will improve the understanding of the electrophysiology of cell therapy for IHD, and lay important basic groundwork for more extensive, science-based, clinical trials. The long-term goal of this study is to develop a cure for SCD associated with IHD.

aggressive behavior in patients with soft tissue sarcomas (STS). This hypothesis will be tested by an
integrated approach, analyzing human tumor samples and conducting genetic studies that include
generation of in vitro and in vivo models. Aim 1. To define the clinical and biological implications of RB
inactivation for proliferation and genomic stability in STS. We will characterize RB mutations, altered patterns
of pRB and E2F1 expression, as well as upstream regulators (cyclin D, Cdk4). We will also assess Mad2
expression, an E2F1 transcriptional target that when deregulated causes chromosome instability and
aneuploidy. We will assess the consequences of RB inactivation, identifying up- and down-regulated targets
by high throughput studies. Aim 2. To characterize molecular alterations affecting the p53 pro-apoptotic
response and define their clinical significance in STS. We will conduct a systematic characterization of TP53
mutations and p53 expression using a combination of methods. We will analyze regulatory events of the p53
pathway, focusing on Hdm2 and p14/Arf expression. We will study p53 apoptotic signaling, centering on Bax
and Bcl-2, PUMA and NOXA, defining their impact on tumor progression and lack of response to particular
treatments. The mechanistic consequences of p53 inactivation will be evaluated using functional assays.
Aim 3. To determine the molecular mechanisms of tumor suppression by the Pten pathway in STS. We will
establish the clinical relevance of detecting PTEN mutations and altered Pten expression. We will investigate
the impact of downstream events, such as activation of Akt, mTOR and elF4E, as they participate in
sarcomagenesis and STS progression. In addition, we are generating murine models to determine whether
inactivation of Rb, p53 and Pten are required and cooperate for sarcoma development and progression. Our
main objectives include: i) to assess the basis of the functional crosstalk between RB, p53, and PTEN
pathways in tumor suppression; and ii) to translate basic and medical research findings into clinically applied
studies. Our final translational goal is to produce a paradigm shift in clinical practice by incorporating
biomarkers as robust decision tools to better guide the management of STS patients."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The applicant's long-term goal is to direct a basic science research program exploring the role of endothelial cells and their progenitors in organ fibrosis and tumor progression. The applicant has been trained in somatic stem cell biology during her thesis work and was later able to apply this knowledge in cardiovascular research where she was additionally trained in embryonic stem cell biology. During the first part of a postdoctoral fellowship, the applicant expanded her knowledge on stem cell biology and gained new insights into embryonic development. During these studies, the applicant became interested in the cellular plasticity that is displayed by endothelial cells both during embryonic development and also in adult disease states. The applicant is now an Instructor in Medicine in the Kalluri laboratory, where both tumor angiogenesis and organ fibrosis are major research foci, and thus it was a natural extension of the applicant's interests to study endothelial cell plasticity in the setting of the tumor microenvironment. The applicant's previous studies for the first time demonstrated that in cardiac fibrosis endothelial cells contribute to the pool of fibroblasts via an endothelial transition and that inhibition of EndMT can lead to decreased fibrosis and improved cardiac function. The research project proposed here centers on testing the hypothesis that EndMT also plays a role in tumor fibrogenesis. This hypothesis is based on immunohistochemical staining which revealed cells that are double positive for both endothelial and fibroblasts in several tumor types, indicating that endothelial cells can undergo EndMT. The primary aim of the proposal is to provide genetic evidence that endothelial cells contribute to the fibroblast population in the tumor microenvironment by undergoing EndMT. For this purpose, endothelial lineage tracing by TielCre; R26RstoplacZ double transgenic mice, in which all cells of endothelial origin are irreversibly marked with lacZ, will be used. Second, the impact of EndMT on tumor progression will be evaluated by creating transgenic mice in which fibroblasts of endothelial origin will be selectively ablated. If the tested hypothesis is valid, EndMT might represent an important target for the treatment of cancer.

We are interested in the mechanistic understanding of a major signaling pathway mediated by Wnts in the control of vertebrate embryonic development, in particular, limb development and skeletal morphogeneis. Early in limb development, signaling molecules which include the Wnt family members determine where and when the late structures, i.e., skeletal elements will form. Skeletal morphogeneis in the limb occurs through endochondral bone formation in which chondrocytes (they form the cartilage) and osteoblasts (they secrete bone matrix) are differentiated from mesenchymal condensations. This is followed by sequential proliferation and maturation of both chondrocytes and osteoblasts, which are tightly regulated and coordinated to ensure proper morphogenesis of the skeletal system. Apart from Wnt signlaing pathways, other signaling pathways such PTHrP also plays a crtical role in regulating chondrocyte hypertophy, a process required for endochondral bone formation. To understand the molecular mechanism whereby Wnt signaling regulates chondrocyte hypertrophy and maturation, in the past year, we have investigated the interplay between signaling pathways of Wnt and PTHrP in controlling chondrocyte hypertrophy through analyzing mutant mice in which Wnt and PTHrP signaling components are either inactivated or ectopically expressed, we have uncovered that PTHrP signaling acts downstream of Wnt signlaing in regulating chondrocyte hypetrophy. Furthermore,  we found that Wnt signlaing regulates the final maturation of hypertrophic chondrocytes independently of PTHrP signaling.","1023617",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although both craniofacial and appendicular osteosarcomas are diagnosed under the rubric of osteosarcoma, their clinical phenotypes are actually distinct. Comparison of patterns of LOH have shown that primary craniofacial osteosarcoma is a different disease from appendicular osteosarcoma. This is likely the result of the developmental pathways by which the bones of craniofacial and appendicular skeleton arise; the craniofacial bones arise from cranial neural crest cells while the appendicular skeleton arises from mesenchymal-derived cells. Chemotherapy treatment leads to vastly different morbidity outcomes - craniofacial patients have a40% survival rate compared to an 80% survival rate for appendicular osteosarcoma. Given the outcome with conventional agents for this disease, there is clearly a need to develop a more informative classification systems by employing comprehensive analytical techniques to identify new potential targets for therapy. A molecular-based classification scheme identifying alterations in unique pathways in each tumor type identify such possible therapeutic targets. Differences between craniofacial and appendicular tumors should be detectable as quantitative and qualitative alterations in gene expression levels that together constitute definitive molecular signatures. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that these molecular signatures will correlate with clinical phenotype. A corollary hypothesis is that these molecular signatures will identify differentially regulated pathways in the tumors that may serve as targets for alternative therapies.   
  
The specific aims for this proposal are: 1. Generate molecular signatures of primary appendicular and craniofacial osteosarcoma tumor samples by cDNA microarray analysis. 2. Correlate the molecular signatures with alterations in pathways.   
  
The ability to distinguish craniofacial osteosarcomas from appendicular osteosarcomas should have a positive impact on understanding the molecular basis of the disease and accelerate development of new treatments. This work is therefore likely to have an impact on the clinical management of osteosarcoma patients.   
  
My career goal is to become an independent dental research scientist in the field of molecular genetics or cancer genetics. In these next five years, I hope to attain and develop the necessary skills to achieve my aspiration. This training experience will help strengthen both my laboratory bench technique and application of the scientific method. With a sound foundation, I may be able to have an impact on some of my other areas of scientific inquiry - squamous cell carcinoma and fibrous dysplasia. I enthusiastically strive to become a more effective scientist with the hopes of one day making a significant contribution to the field of craniofacial biology.

LNs
are basement membrane glycoproteins essential for normal pulmonary development. During the current
funding period we demonstrated the importance of laminin-1 (LN-1) and laminin-2 (LN-2) in promoting
bronchial myogenesis. Now our objective is to understand the molecular pathway involved in this process
Preliminary studies suggest that LN-1 and -2 stimulate myogenesis by a mechanism involving P311, j
protein of uncertain function recently identified in neurons and muscle. Pilot studies focused in the
developing mouse lung suggested that P311 is induced by LN-2 and to a lesser extent by LN-1. In addition,
our studies suggested that the synthesis of the two LNs is mechano-sensitive. Based on these and other
preliminary data presented here we hypothesize that LN regulates myogenesis by a signaling pathway
that involves P311, depends on mechanical stimuli and engages GTPases as downstream effectors
We will use a combination of embryonic mesenchymal cells and lung organ cultures from normal and dy/dy
mice (no LN-2), plus a variety of functional probes to address this hypothesis. In aim#l we will determine
the role of P311 in lung development. In aim #2 we will elucidate the involvement of LNs 2 and 1 and P311
in stretch-mediated bronchial myogenesis. In aim #3 we will identify the downstream molecular pathway
activated in LN/P311 stimulation of bronchial myogenesis. Part A of this aim will focus on the role of Cdc42
and RhoA. Part B will study P311 interaction with other proteins, including Vav2, a proto-oncogene that
activates Cdc42 and RhoA. We expect this project to define a novel molecular pathway controlling bronchia
myogenesis. This pathway may be common to various myogenic stimuli and is likely to be abnormal in lung
disease, as our ongoing studies seem to indicate. We anticipate, therefore, that this project will advance our

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoblasts, the cells that form bone, are mesenchymal in origin and like other mesenchymal lineages arise from pluripotential stem cells through a series of developmental transitions. The osteoblast developmental pathway is only partially understood, particularly in its early stages, where little is know about the cell fate decisions that lead to commitment to the osteoblast lineage. Adipocytes, the cells that produce fat, likely share a common early progenitor with osteoblasts, although little is known about the molecular control of this lineage bifurcation. Growing evidence indicates that transcription factors required for B lymphocyte development from hematopoietic stem cells are critical for proper skeletal development although as yet none have been implicated in osteoblast differentiation. We have discovered that Early B Cell Factor-1 (EBF-1), a transcription factor essential for B cell development, is expressed in osteoblasts and plays a critical role in controlling osteoblast development. EBF-1 deficient mice are runted, have increased bone formation parameters, and display a striking increase in numbers of osteoblasts. Remarkably, these mice also exhibit a dramatic expansion of adipocytes in the medullary canal of long bones. The central hypothesis underlying this proposal is that EBF-1 and its upstream regulatory and downstream target genes are critical for the control of osteoblast and adipocyte development. Our findings suggest that EBF-1 and EBF-1 deficient mice provide a unique opportunity to gain significant molecular insight into the development of these two lineages. The long-term goal of our work is to identify the mechanism(s) by which EBF-1 regulates osteogenesis and adipogenesis. The first step in achieving this goal is a careful analysis of the EBF-1 deficient mice at the histological, morphological, cellular, and molecular level, which will provide the information needed to formulate detailed molecular hypotheses for the role of EBF-1 in bone and fat cell development. Toward this end, we will pursue two Specific Aims: 1) To determine the bone phenotype of EBF-1 deficient mice; and 2) To characterize through a quantitative analysis the functional and molecular properties of EBF-1 deficient osteoblasts, osteoblast precursors, and adipocytes. We anticipate that these experiments will lead to new models for osteoblast development and hence for the potential to discover new anabolic pathways. Such information would be applicable to a wide variety of skeletal defects including age-related osteopenia, post-menopausal osteoporosis, fracture repair, and extended survival of prosthetic implants.

The growth of calvarial bones begins as mesenchymal cell condensations which proliferate and ultimately differentiate into matrix-synthesizing osteoblasts. The homeobox transcription factor Msx2 plays a direct role in tissue interactions that pattern the cranium. Mutations in the human MSX2 gene are associated with Boston-type craniosynostosis while functional 
haploinsufficiency of MSX2 causes defects in skull ossification. The molecular mechanisms of skull patterning and morphogenesis are poorly understood. Among the signaling molecules expressed in tissues involved in patterning of calvarial bones are bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) which regulate the expression of Msx2. Lack of calvarium in the ""congenital hydrocephalus"" mouse is caused by a mutation in the fork head transcription factor FoxC1 which is required for Msx2 induction by BMP. The fundamental goal of this project is to unravel the mechanism whereby FoxC1, an essential transcription factor for normal calvarial development, modulates BMP signaling. The requested training support from NIDCR will permit the applicant to determine if a direct interaction exists between Smads and FoxC1, to define the DMA target site preference for FoxC1 and to determine the role of phosphorylation in BMP2-induced FoxC1-dependent Msx2 transcriptional regulation. Long-term goals of the candidate include: to contribute to the advancement of research in craniofacial bone biology and BMP signaling and to teach in a dental school setting.  
  
Relevance: The regulation of MSX2, an essential gene involved in skull and suture development, by Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) requires functional FoxC1 protein. Mutations in FoxC1 have been identified in patients with hydrocephalus in addition to dental and anterior segment of the eye abnormalities. Our goal is to elucidate the mechanism through which FoxC1 participates in the BMP regulation of MSX2.","135000",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Migratory pluripotent neural crest cells (NCCs) are a novel vertebrate invention that generates an astounding variety of tissue types. From the peripheral nervous system to endocrine and craniofacial structures, NCCs contribute the distinguishing features of many organs. Prior to their migration to various target destinations throughout the embryo, NCCs must undergo induction along the neural plate, specification, and then delamination from the neuroepithelium. Although some of the major regulators of NCC induction and specification have been identified, the control of delamination and the initiation of migration remain poorly understood. Characterizing how sets of stationary pluripotent cells are transformed into directionally migrating streams of tissue precursors may have major implications for understanding vertebrate development and evolution, but may also reveal how non-migratory cells lose their cell adhesions and become metastatic in pathological conditions. The aim of this project is to take advantage of recent technological developments to conduct functional genomics as well as high-throughput reverse genetics approaches to identify new regulators of NCCs prior to the initiation of migration. The recent availability of the zebrafish genome sequence as well as comprehensive microarray platforms and fluorescently activated cell sorting techniques (FACS) make the zebrafish an excellent model for conducting these experiments. Specifically, identifying the targets of known transcriptional regulators of NCC, such as Snail and LEF1, and conducting time-course transcriptional analysis of NCC development will substantially expand our knowledge of NCC control. In addition, a genome duplication event that affected a zebrafish ancestor provides an opportunity to study ortholdgs which may have undergone sub-functionalization, thereby releasing some genes from earlier functions beyond which other vertebrates (e.g. chick, mouse, or frog) fail to develop when their single copy is mutated. Understanding how cells move during normal embryonic development can contribute tremendously to our ability to diagnose and treat pathological conditions, such as metastasis, fibrosis, and carcinoma. Many of the genes implicated in these diseases are also thought to be active in early developmental events such as the delamination and migration of neural crest cells. A more thorough analysis of the genes regulating neural crest activity will facilitate the identification of other potential disease regulators that may be useful diagnostic as well as therapeutic targets.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long term goal is to understand the transcriptional mechanisms of chondrocyte differentiation. Our previous work has demonstrated that Sox9 has a central role in chondrogenesis and is needed at multiple steps in the pathway of chondrocyte differentiation. Sox9 is initially needed to establish an osteochondroprogenitor; subsequently it is required for chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations. Sox9 is then needed for overt differentiation of chondrocytes, in part because Sox9 is required for expression of Sox5 and Sox6, which are needed for overt chondrocyte differentiation. Later in the pathway Sox9 still has another important role because it participates in the physiological inhibition of the maturation of chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes. In addition to its roles in the chondrocyte differentiation pathway, Sox9 is also needed for the differentiation of a small number of other cell lineages. Four specific aims are proposed to gain new insights in the mechanisms by which Sox9 and L-Sox5 control chondrocyte differentiation. The repertoire of genes controlled by Sox9 at two major steps in the chondrocyte differentiation program will first be identified. The hypothesis will also be tested whether Sox9 controls the expression of specific cell surface associated proteins or other proteins, needed for chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations. The role of TIP60 as a coactivator of Sox9 and L-Sox5 during chondrogenesis will be further characterized and new polypeptides that are part of transcriptional complexes, which interact with Sox9 will be identified. The patterns of Sox9 and L-Sox5 binding sites and those of polypeptide complexes, which interact with chondrocyte-specific promoters and enhancers, in intact chondrocytes will also be determined. In vitro reconstituted nucleosomal templates of the Col2a1 regulatory segments will be used in order to dissect the function of Sox9, L-Sox5 and other transcriptionally active polypeptides in chromatin disruption and transcription. These experiments should greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms whereby Sox9 controls chondrocyte differentiation and may suggest new therapeutic approaches for cartilage diseases.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epithelial to Mesenchymal Cell Transition (EMT) is one of the major problems following cataract surgery. Lens epithelial cells adherent to the lens capsule can grow and differentiate into mesenchymal cells resulting in posterior capsule opacification (PCO). This process leads to secondary cataracts that have to be treated again. Identification of factors that promote transdifferentiation of the lens epithelial cells is of paramount importance for possible therapies of PCO. Unfortunately, experiments in this field are hindered by the lack of experimental models where the powerful genetic techniques can be applied. We have found that when extracapsular surgery is performed in the mouse, the remaining lens epithelial cells on the capsule proliferate rapidly and fill the bag with normal looking lens fibers. Normal morphology of the ""regenerated"" lens can also be seen, with established bow regions. The morphology of the regenerated lens depends on the surgery and the integrity of the lens capsule. However, along with the normal differentiation to lens fibers, lens epithelial cells can also transdifferentiate to mesenchymal cells, especially at the early stages of lens regeneration. This lens regeneration mouse model can become, therefore, an indispensable and long-sought animal model to study PCO. Taking advantage of such an animal model system we propose to study global gene expression patterns and gene discovery during the process. In order to achieve this we will examine lens regeneration in mice with mutations in genes important to EMT and PCO. At the same time the ability of these mice to undergo (or not) lens regeneration or EMT will be correlated with gene expression using whole mouse genome microarrays. Expression and roles of key genes will be verified in functional assays using capsular bags. The databases that will be established will be compared with each other and with databases established from developing, adult and cataractous lenses. This research will eventually identify gene patterns of known and novel genes that are involved in EMT and PCO as well as in normal lens fiber differentiation. This research aims to establish new ways for the treatment of secondary cataracts and the elimination of posterior capsule opacification. Also, this research will address the bipotency of lens epithelial cells to undergo EMT, which results in secondary cataracts, or lens fiber differentiation, which is a normal repair process.

Indian hedgehog (Ihh), one of the three mammalian homologs of the Drosophila Hedgehog (Hh) gene and the only known Hh gene expressed in the vertebrate skeleton, is indispensable for osteoblast differentiation in the endochondral skeleton. Because Ihh deficient mice arrest early in the development of the osteoblast lineage, it is therefore not known whether Ihh is also important for later stages of osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms underlying the early roles of Ihh in osteoblast differentiation are not known. This proposal sets out to expand our knowledge about the potential roles of Ihh in osteoblast differentiation and to determine whether Ihh functions by interacting with other molecules important for this process. Three Specific Aims are proposed. Aim 1: to examine potential roles of hedgehog signaling in preosteoblasts and osteoblasts. Specifically, the Cre-loxP technology will be used to remove the gene Smoothened, which encodes an obligatory component of the Hh pathway, from preosteoblasts and osteoblasts; Aim 2: to assess relationship between Ihh and Cbfa1 in osteoblast differentiation. In the Ihh null mutant, Cbfa1 expression is abolished in the perichondrium of the long bones, where osteoblasts first arise during development. In order to determine whether Cbfa1 deficiency is solely responsible for the osteoblast defect, Cbfa1 wilI be forced-expressed by a genetic means in the perichondrium to examine whether osteoblast differentiation is restored in Ihh null mice; Aim 3: to examine interactions between lhh and Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathways in osteoblast differentiation. Although the Wnt canonical signaling pathway has been implicated in osteoblast proliferation and function in postnatal life in both mice and men, genetic evidence linking Wnt signaling to osteoblast differentiation is lacking. Therefore Cre-loxP technology will be used to remove b-catenin from the progenitor cells of the osteoblast lineage. Biochemical analyses of the potential interaction between Ihh and b-catenin signaling pathways will also be performed in a cell culture system. Finally, genetic experiments will be performed to determine whether artificial activation of b-catenin signaling will rescue the osteogenic defect in the absence of Hh signaling.","300691",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although therapy with adult bone marrow (BM)-derived unfractionated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) improves cardiac function, remodeling, and perfusion after MI, the extents of MSC-induced angiogenesis, myogenesis, and antiapoptotic and `paracrine effects' have been inconsistent in studies from different laboratories. These apparent discrepancies might have stemmed from the heterogeneous nature of unfractionated `MSCs', and the use of dissimilar expansion protocols in different laboratories. Our fundamental hypothesis is that a primitive and homogenous MSC subpopulation isolated on the basis of surface antigen expression will exhibit greater endothelial and cardiomyogenic differentiation potential, and secrete greater amounts of cardioprotective growth factors/cytokines; and that optimization of medium is critical for the expansion of MSC subpopulation specifically intended for cardiac repair without significant changes in antigenic phenotype, gene expression, differentiation potential, and secretory profile. Accordingly, Aim 1 will thoroughly examine whether compared with unfractionated MSCs, an antigenically-defined MSC subpopulation exhibits a more primitive phenotype, expresses endothelial/cardiomyogenic lineage markers, and undergoes greater endothelial/cardiomyogenic differentiation. Expression of markers of pluripotency and lineage commitment will be compared using real-time RT-PCR in unfractionated MSCs and MSC subpopulations isolated by flow cytometry based on the expression of CD45, c-kit, Flk-1, Sca-1, CD90, and CD105. Endothelial and cardiomyogenic differentiation will be rigorously quantitated (morphology, immunocytochemistry, confocal microscopy). To predict in vivo efficacy, differentiation (and secretory profile in Aim 2) will be assessed in culture conditions that simulate the in vivo milieu. Aim 2 will examine whether an antigenically-defined MSC subpopulation secretes greater amounts of cardioprotective growth factors/cytokines, and whether gene expression profiles correlate with secretory profiles. Aim 3 will conclusively establish the optimal medium composition for the expansion of select MSC subpopulation(s) with no or minimal alterations in surface antigen expression, gene expression, differentiation potential, and secretory abilities. Four primary media (DMEM, IMDM, 1-MEM, and Mesencult) and five factors (LIF, IGF-1, FGF-2, PDGF-B, and Wnt3a) will be examined. Antigen and gene expression, differentiation, and secreted factors will be examined during serial passages. In summary, this exploratory/developmental proposal aims to identify a novel MSC subpopulation most suitable for cardiac repair, and to establish the optimal medium that will expand these cells without significant changes in surface antigen expression/gene expression/differentiation potential/secretory attributes for future cardiac repair in vivo. The results of the proposed investigations will not only provide novel insights into MSC biology, but may also identify a cellular population ideally-suited for cardiac repair in patients with ischemic heart disease and post-MI heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ischemic heart disease is the single most prevalent cause of death and morbidity in all Western countries. Despite significant advances in medical treatments, the prognosis for patients with large heart attacks is poor with eventual progression to end-stage heart failure and death. Although recent studies indicate that therapy with adult primitive cells can repair dead heart muscle, the results have been variable, and the mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, the identification of an ideal cell for heart repair, a major goal of this exploratory proposal would have enormous therapeutic implications for patients with ischemic heart disease and heart failure. The optimization of culture medium for expansion of this cell population will help generate a large number of cells for potential use in vivo. The results of the proposed studies will therefore be highly relevant for improving public health, and improving the length and quality of life of millions of patients with ischemic heart disease and heart failure.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The early development of the inner ear occurs in three phases: formation of the otic placode, the earliest rudiment of the inner ear; morphogenesis of the otic placode, forming the otic pit (cup) and otocyst; and axis formation and regional patterning of the otocyst. Each phase is characterized by inductive interactions among different tissues. Although several signaling systems have been implicated in the control of these phases, Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling clearly plays a critical role and is the focus of this proposal. This project combines the broad technical and scientific expertise of two investigators and uses two animal models to examine the cellular, molecular and genetic control of early inner ear development. To study the formation and patterning of the rudiments of the inner ear we will conduct experiments designed to achieve three specific aims. First, using tissue recombination experiments and modern molecular techniques, we will establish how fgf19, Wnt8c and fgf3, critical factors that we identified in the previous project period in formation of the otic placode, are localized in the cephalic paraxial mesoderm of the early chick embryo. This will allow us to determine how the rudiments of the inner ear are positioned within the head of the developing embryo. Second, we will determine the roles of Fgf4 and Fgf8 in formation of the rudiments of the inner ear. Expression studies, experimental embryology and genetic analyses from the previous project period strongly implicated these two factors in inner ear development. Third, we will determine and compare the roles of Fgf16 and Fgf3 in the patteming of the rudiments of the inner ear in mouse and chick. Expression studies and analyses of Fgf3/Fgf10 mutant embryos from the previous project period led to the hypothesis that these two factors play essential roles in formation of the otic axes and/or specification of cell types within the developing inner ear. This hypothesis will be rigorously tested taking advantage of the unique strengths of the two animal model systems that we employ in our studies. By achieving these three aims, we will gain important new information on the normal development of the inner ear and the FGFs that regulate its formation and patterning. Additionally, our studies will furnish insight into mechanisms by which these developmental processes go awry, underlying the formation of serious birth defects of the auditory system in humans.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bcl-2 protects cells from apoptosis initiated by a variety of stimuli including loss of cell adhesion. Mice deficient in bcl-2 (bcl-2 -/-) develop renal hypoplastic/cystic dysplasia, a condition that leads to significant morbidity and mortality in children. The precise mechanism of action of bcl-2 has not been elucidated. Our hypothesis is that early embryonic expression of bcl-2 facilitates morphogenesis by supporting survival of precursor cells allowing them to be less adherent and migratory without the threat of apoptosis. Bcl-2 may facilitate survival of precursor cells and/or play a more ""active"" role during morphogenesis by interacting with other proteins such as paxillin. Our data demonstrate that paxillin interacts with the bcl-2 BH4 domain in embryonic kidneys. The bcl-2 BH4 domain is sufficient and necessary for its cell survival activity. Bcl-2 with the BH4 domain deleted lacks the survival function but still avidly binds to other bcl-2 family members. We will determine the domain(s) of paxillin that interact with bcl-2 and their influence on cell adhesive mechanisms during kidney development. Our preliminary data indicate that ureteric bud (UB) branching morphogenesis is adversely affected in bcl-2 -/- mice. Metanephroi from bcl-2 -/- mice undergo decreased UB branching in organ culture and bcl-2 -/- UB cells fail to undergo branching morphogenesis in collagen gels. Furthermore, wild-type embryonic kidneys incubated with bcl-2 BH4 domain peptide exhibit defective UB branching morphogenesis. We will investigate the role bcl-2 plays during UB branching and whether aberrant UB branching contributes to excessive apoptosis of the metanephric blastema in bcl-2 -/- mice. We will determine whether the abnormalities of renal development in bcl-2 -/- mice is primarily or exclusively the result of the absence of bcl-2 in the UB or metanephric mesenchyme. Therefore, understanding the normal functions of bcl-2 during nephrogenesis and the consequences of its interaction with paxillin will give us important insight into kidney morphogenesis and pathogenesis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Liver fibrogenesis is a complex process which comprises of a sequence of events including inflammatory cell infiltration and proliferation of matrix-producing mesenchymal cells, with an increased accumulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including type I collagen. At the center of the fibrogenic process are the hepatic stellate cells (HSC). Recently we have shown that HSC phagocytose apoptotic bodies (AB) from dying hepatocytes and this induces NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation and resulting superoxide production and release both into the intracellular and intracellular milieu. Intracellular superoxide then induces procollagen a 1(I) upregulation, thereby contributing to the fibrogenic process. Phagocytosis by HSC is likely to be a common, universal pathway leading to fibrosis independent of the etiology of the liver disease, linking chronic liver injury with apoptosis of hepatocytes to clearance of AB with resulting scar formation. As NOX activation appears to be a critical element in inducing HSC activation, and it is unknown whether the phagocytic NOX (NOX2) plays role in engulfment, our HYPOTHESIS is that AB engulfment leads specifically to NOX2 activation, and that this via the Rac-GTPase activates signaling pathways, leading to increased motility and activation of HSC. The SPECIFIC AIMS of this proposal will be answering two key questions generated by this hypothesis:   
1. Is NOX2 playing a role in the phagocytosis of AB in HSC? And   
2. Does PS binding to its receptor (PS-R) on HSC, and the subsequent engulfment of AB, induce NOX2 and downstream signaling pathways?   
In this proposal we develop new areas of investigation that are the natural extension of the specific aims described in the original K08 application, and based on data derived from the studies described in the K08 grant. The importance of studying the proposed signaling events is enhanced by the fact that these likely represent common pathways in liver fibrosis, independent of etiology.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Migratory pluripotent neural crest cells (NCCs) are a novel vertebrate invention that generates an astounding variety of tissue types. From the peripheral nervous system to endocrine and craniofacial structures, NCCs contribute the distinguishing features of many organs. Prior to their migration to various target destinations throughout the embryo, NCCs must undergo induction along the neural plate, specification, and then delamination from the neuroepithelium. Although some of the major regulators of NCC induction and specification have been identified, the control of delamination and the initiation of migration remain poorly understood. Characterizing how sets of stationary pluripotent cells are transformed into directionally migrating streams of tissue precursors may have major implications for understanding vertebrate development and evolution, but may also reveal how non-migratory cells lose their cell adhesions and become metastatic in pathological conditions. The aim of this project is to take advantage of recent technological developments to conduct functional genomics as well as high-throughput reverse genetics approaches to identify new regulators of NCCs prior to the initiation of migration. The recent availability of the zebrafish genome sequence as well as comprehensive microarray platforms and fluorescently activated cell sorting techniques (FACS) make the zebrafish an excellent model for conducting these experiments. Specifically, identifying the targets of known transcriptional regulators of NCC, such as Snail and LEF1, and conducting time-course transcriptional analysis of NCC development will substantially expand our knowledge of NCC control. In addition, a genome duplication event that affected a zebrafish ancestor provides an opportunity to study ortholdgs which may have undergone sub-functionalization, thereby releasing some genes from earlier functions beyond which other vertebrates (e.g. chick, mouse, or frog) fail to develop when their single copy is mutated. Understanding how cells move during normal embryonic development can contribute tremendously to our ability to diagnose and treat pathological conditions, such as metastasis, fibrosis, and carcinoma. Many of the genes implicated in these diseases are also thought to be active in early developmental events such as the delamination and migration of neural crest cells. A more thorough analysis of the genes regulating neural crest activity will facilitate the identification of other potential disease regulators that may be useful diagnostic as well as therapeutic targets.

The ability to identify and manipulate adult dental stem cells (DSCs) would significantly facilitate this process. Although a considerable body of literature supports the existence of epithelial and mesenchymal DSCs, DSCs themselves remain poorly characterized relative to other stem cells including neural, bone marrow stromal, hematopoetic, spermatogonial and keratinocyte stem cells. In particular, tools such as antibodies to DSC surface markers that could be used to generate enriched DSC populations, to identify adult DSC populations, and to examine the induction of odontogenic potential in non-dental tissues, are currently lacking. We hypothesize that the identification and characterization of post-natal dental stem cell (DSCs), combined with state-of the art tissue engineering techniques, will facilitate whole tooth tissue engineering efforts. Our recent tooth tissue engineering results demonstrate our ability to isolate, and maintain in culture, epithelial and mesenchymal post-natal DSCs, and to use these cells to bioengineer small tooth crowns containing dentin and enamel. Based on these promising initial results, here we propose studies whose successful completion will define methods to bioengineer teeth of predetermined size and shape. We propose: 1) to establish and characterize enriched epithelial and mesenchymal DSC populations using well-characterized stem cell sorting techniques, and to confirm their identity using our functional tooth tissue-engineering assay; and 2) to define scaffold materials and design for optimized bioengineering of tooth tissues of specified size and shape. The successful completion of the proposed aims will significantly improve our knowledge and understanding of DSCs and their potential utility in tooth tissue engineering, and will provide the foundation for eventual autologous tooth tissue engineering in humans.","334624",

Lung mesenchyme gives rise to the various lineages of pulmonary smooth muscle, including vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) which are essential for blood vessel integrity. However, little is known of the molecular signaling processes that are involved in the specification and/or differentiation of VSMCs in the lung, although paracrine signaling from the endoderm has been shown to play an important rote. Proper development of the pulmonary vasculature is important in the development of the lung as a functional organ and defects in this process can lead to several human diseases including pulmonary hypertension. We have shown that inactivation of the Wnt7b gene, which is expressed in the developing airway epithelium, results in loss of vascular smooth muscle integrity in the lung, leading to perinatal hemorrhage and death. Since
Wnt7b expression in the lung decreases in late gestation, we hypothesize that Wnt7b is required for proper development of VSMCs from lung mesenchyme through epithelial-mesenchymal signaling occurring early in lung development. In support of this hypothesis, we have found that the winged-helix transcription factor Foxf2, which is expressed in lung mesenchyme, is specifically down regulated in the lungs of Wnt7b/lacz-/- embryos. These results suggest that vascular smooth muscle development and integrity requires Wnt7b signaling, possibly by regulating genes such as Foxf2, which are required for proper development of VSCMs
from lung mesenchyme. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt7b regulation of VSMC development in the lung by addressing three questions: 1) Does Wnt7b act on definitive VSMCs or their precursors during lung vascular development?, 2) Does Wnt7b signal via canonical or non-canonical Wnt pathways in lung VMSC development and what are the global roles for these pathways in this process?, and 3) What are the down-stream effector pathways that Wnt7b influences to regulate VSMC differentiation and development? We expect that the results of these studies will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying vascular heterogeneity and, in particular, how Writ signaling regulates these developmental events."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Two unique bone targeting peptides that were identified in our laboratory potentiate the differentiation of mesenchymal cells in vitro. We have shown this by measuring increases in alkaline phosphatase activity and gene expression for osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, osterix and RUNX2, moreover, the peptides promote bone repair in critical sized unicortical defects in rat tibias. We have identified the molecular targets for these peptides in mesenchymal cells, and our analysis of the data suggest that certain pathways in bone metabolism are involved through which the peptides exert their osteogenic effects. We now propose to study the anabolic effects of the osteotropic peptides by treating C57BL/6J mice and analyzing changes in bone density and mass with fluorochrome labeling and histomorphometry, microCT and biomechanics. We have chosen the C57BL/6J mouse strain because these mice lose bone mass with age, therefore, the C57BL/6J strain may be useful in exploring, both in vivo and in vitro, the molecular mechanism whereby the peptides have their effect on bone metabolism. A pilot study will determine if this mouse strain is suitable as an alternative to ovariectomized mice to explore the anabolic effect and the molecular mechanism of action of the peptides. We will investigate the effect of two osteotropic peptides that potentiate mesenchymal cell differentiation in vitro and bone repair in unicortical defects in vivo in this mouse model, and study the potential anabolic effects of these novel peptides on bone loss. The peptides will be delivered systemically by subcutaneous injection into C57BL/6J mice. Changes in bone mineral density will be measured, and mechanistic changes with fluorochrome labeling and histomorphometry, microCT and biomechanical testing will be determined. The aims of the project are: 1) to measure changes in mineral density, composition, architecture and biomechanical properties of bone, demonstrate the anabolic effect of the peptides on bone loss in a mouse model and compare with the effect of PTH; 2) determine the effect of the peptides on metabolic pathways in cells obtained from mice treated with the peptide. Our studies will address the potential for treating bone loss with small molecules that affect the differentiation of mesenchymal cells in bone. A sound scientific basis will help future investigations lay the foundation for developing potential therapies that prevent osteoporosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this proposal is to investigate the anabolic effect of unique osteogenic peptides on bone mass in C57BL/6J mice. In vivo and in vitro methods will determine the effect of the peptides on changes in bone mass, composition and architecture in these mice, as well as the effect on gene expression on cells from bone and marrow.

Overexpression of a human CR-1 transgene in the mouse mammary gland       using an MMTV orWAP promoter results in the appearance of ductal hyperplasias in the mammary       gland and papillary amd histologically mixed subtypes of adenocarcinomas in multiparous female       mice. Recombinant mouse or human cripto can enhance cell motility and branching morphogenesis       in mouse mammary epithelial cells and in some human tumor cells. These effects are accompanied       by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition which is associated with a decrease in beta-catenin       adherens function and an increase in vimentin expression. Expression of CR-1 is increased       several-fold in human colon, gastric, pancreatic, cervical, ovarian and lung carcinomas and in       a variety of different types of mouse and human breast carcinomas. More importantly, this       increase in cripto-1 expression can first be detected in premalignant lesions in some of these       tissues such as in the breast ( hyperplasias and DCIS ), colon ( adenomas ) and stomach       ( intestinal metaplasias ). We have recently identied the Activin ALK4 type       1 receptor as a co-receptor for CR-1 which presents Nodal to ALK4 and thereby can stimulate       Smad-2 phosphorylation and transcription through an SBE-luciferase reporter construct.In       addition, CR-1 can function through a Nodal and ALK4-independent signaling pathway and       activate MAPK, PI-3 kinase and Akt by binding to the GPI-linked heparan sulphate-containing       proteoglycan, glypican-1 which can then activate c-src. Activation of MAPK, PI-3 kinase,       GSK-3beta and Akt in mammary epithelial cells by CR-1 are required for the ability of CR-1 to       stimulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition, cell migration and cell invasion which is       invovled in metastasis and angiogenesis. The invasive effects of CR-1 can be antagonized by       the neural guidance protein Netrin-1 through the UNC5b receptor in mammary epithelial cells.       CR-1 is also invovled in maintaing embryonic stem cell pluripotentiality and may perform a       similar function in adult stem cells in the mammary gland and colon. CR-1 can be found at       significant levels in the plasma of breast and colon cancer paptients and may therefore       represent a novel marker to detect the onset or progression of these diseases.","1042793",

The Transgenic and Embryonic Stem Cell (TG/ES) Core seeks to integrate the efforts of several investigators working to explore epithelial and stromal interactions and contributions leading to mammary carcinogenesis. The TG/ES Core has several specific goals related to the mammary oncogenesis project. The first of these goals is to develop transgenic mouse strains expressing Cre recombinase targeted to the mammary stromal fibroblasts under the influence of tissue-specific and inducible promoters. The TG/ES Core will also produce, import, rederive, distribute and cryopreserve strains of mice necessary to carry out individual Projects in the Program Project Grant.

BRIEF EXPLANATION OF RESEARCH PROJECT--This study will be a Phase I dose-escalation trial to evaluate the safety of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) transfusion in patients with acute ischemic stroke.  Stroke remains the leading cause of adult disability in the U.S.  Most patients do not access healthcare early enough to benefit from hyperacute stroke therapies.  In animal models of stroke, administration of MSC days after infarct has been associated with improved behavioral outcome.  MSC have been found to be safe in several safety studies of humans with non-cerebrovascular diagnoses.  MSC may therefore represent a treatment that can improve outcome in human stroke patients with a wide time window for intervention.
The specific aims will evaluate whether the morbidity and mortality rates among patients receiving this treatment are higher than expected according to specific primary and secondary endpoints.  The primary endpoint focuses on mortality and major thrombotic/infectious adverse events 90 days after treatment.  The secondary endpoints consider these events over a longer term, and further evaluate potential adverse effects on systemic and neurological function."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proper formation of the kidney into a fully functional organ requires the integration of multiple signaling events. During the reiterative process of kidney tubule induction, a delicate balance is struck between signals that maintain a progenitor cell population and those that lead to differentiation. A tip in the balance toward either side has catastrophic consequences. A failure to convert progenitor cells into differentiated epithelia can result in either hypoplasia or progenitor cell-derived cancers, such as Wilms' tumors. Alternatively, if the proper number of progenitor cells is not maintained, they will be depleted prematurely, preventing further nephrogenesis and once again resulting in hypoplasia. Currently, we know little about the molecular mechanisms that control the balance between progenitors and differentiated tubular cells during tissue homeostasis or how these signals are regulated during normal development of the kidney. One of the central dogmas in kidney progenitor cell biology has been that canonical Wnt signaling must be repressed in the progenitor cells in order to keep them undifferentiated. However, we have recently discovered that not only is the canonical Wnt signaling pathway active in progenitors, it may in fact have higher levels of activity in this cell type than in the rest of the metanephric mesenchyme. Specifically, we have found that Wnt9b activates expression of a distinct set of target genes specifically within the progenitor cells and that this occurs through a b-catenin dependent mechanism. We hypothesize that high levels of canonical Wnt signaling activity in progenitor cells are promoted by the canonical Wnt agonists, R-spondin1 and 3, and that the expression of these genes in progenitor cells is dependent on the activity of the transcription factor Six2. However, several questions still remain: Why do some kidney mesenchymal cells differentiate into tubules, while others are maintained in a progenitor pool? What molecules regulate the choice between these alternative cellular states? Does Wnt9b signaling play a role in both populations? And which effectors modulate their different responses? The experiments outlined in this proposal are designed to test our hypotheses, as well as to enhance our understanding of the factors that regulate Wnt9b signaling and progenitor cell biology.PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unlike some organs, such as the pancreas, the functional unit of the kidney is not a single cell but instead a collection of cells organized into a tubule. The future of bioengineering tissue for organ replacement, at least for the kidney and other similar organs like the lung, thus relies not only on our ability to identify precursor or ""stem"" cells but also in our ability to convert these cells in functional tubules. We are interested in understanding the molecular and cellular processes that are required to convert individual cells into tubules.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The small intestinal epithelium is organized into flask-like glands (crypts) that contain intestinal stem cells and finger-like projections (villi) covered by differentiated cells. A constant process of cell division, differentiation and migration is established along a polarized crypt to villus axis. Establishment and maintenance of this vertical axis requires cell:cell crosstalk between the epithelium and the underlying mesenchyme and is critical to proper homeostasis of the intestine. Analysis of a newly established mouse model in which hedgehog (Hh) signals are blocked (Hhip transgenic mice) reveals that establishment of the crypt/villus axis requires this signaling pathway. Hh signals emanate from the epithelium and are received by the mesenchyme. Shh and Ihh participate in this signal; these two signaling proteins have both overlapping and separate roles. Loss of the combined Hh signal permits the formation of ectopic pre-crypt structures on villus tips, thus disrupting the normal organization of the crypt/villus axis. The epithelial phenotype of Hhip mice reflects alterations in cell:cell crosstalk between the epithelial cells and an expanded population of subepithelial myofibroblasts. The proposal tests the following Hypothesis: A combined Ihh and Shh signal from the epithelium is received by subepithelial myofibroblasts and acts indirectly to limit and organize the Wnt responsive epithelial pre-crypt compartment. In Aim 1, the sequence of molecular and morphological events that accompany crypt/villus axis polarization during late intestinal development will be compared in wild type, Shh -/-, Ihh -/- and Hhip mice. In Aim 2, the targets of Hh signaling in the mesenchymal compartment will be identified. Separate and common targets of Shh and Ihh will be sought; the possibility that Hh induces different genes at different concentrations will be tested. Finally, Aim 3 explores how Hh proteins function to organize the crypt/villus axis (i.e., by polarization via a morphogen gradient or by anchoring of the pre-crypt region) and tests specific candidate genes for their role in patterning this axis. The work will provide new insights into cell:cell signaling pathways crucial for intestinal development.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital obstructive nephropathy is the principal cause of pediatric renal failure. The molecular and cellular lesions leading to congenital obstruction, however, are still largely undetermined. We have shown that the absence of calcineurin in the developing urinary tract mesenchyme, in the Pax3Cre Cnb1 mutants we generated, led to congenital obstructive nephropathy resembling Ureteropelvic Junction (UPJ) obstruction in humans. Our study has demonstrated a clear requirement for calcineurin in urinary tract development and provided us with materials and knowledge to further investigate the indispensable signaling events involved and the etiology of congenital obstructive nephropathy.  
  
We propose to first study the interactions between calcineurin and other signaling pathways known to be involved in urinary tract development. This will test the hypothesis that calcineurin is an indispensable signaling transducer for urinary tract development. This will also effectively connect our observations to the existing knowledge in this field and will provide a more comprehensive explanation, at the molecular and cellular level, for the pathogenesis of the congenital obstructive nephropathy. Then, we will develop primary and immortalized cell lines carrying the Cnb1 deletion to determine the effects of calcineurin inactivation in cellular behavior and signaling to test the hypothesis that calcineurin is required for interpreting various extracellular signals in cells of the urinary tract. We will also use genomic/proteomic approaches and molecular genetic methods to identify factors downstream of calcineurin in urinary tract development. Furthermore, we will complement the Pax3Cre-Cnb1 study with Cnb1 deletion in the ureteric bud (UB) derivatives to test the hypothesis that calcineurin has additional indispensable in vivo function in the UB and in the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during urinary tract development. We will use these mutants to further analyze the interactions of the relevant signaling pathways in vivo. Results from the proposed studies will provide mechanistic insights into the function of calcineurin in normal and abnormal development of the urinary tract and the etiology of congenital obstructive nephropathy.

Pulmonary hypertension is a serious, often fatal disease characterized by increased pulmonary arterial pressure, right-heart failure, and remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed. Although current therapy has prolonged survival, the long-term outcome is not favorable. Gene therapy shows promise, however, in vivo administration of non-viral vectors or viral vectors leads to low level gene transfer, random gene expression, and adverse effects, including inflammation. MSCs are self-renewing adult stem cells from bone marrow, are easily isolated and expanded in culture, and have the potential to differentiate into many cell types. It is our hypothesis that gene-modified MSCs may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. The results of preliminary experiments in our laboratory show that the administration of gene-modified MSCs and wild-type or unmodified MSCs improve erectile function in the aged rat. The results of preliminary studies also show that intratracheal administration of wild-type MSCs attenuated monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension and restored pulmonary vasodilator responses to acetylcholine, which were impaired by monocrotaline treatment. The experiments proposed in this application will test the hypothesis that intratracheal administration of MSCs or MSCs modified with the eNOS gene or the CGRP gene will have a beneficial effect in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in the rat. In order to test this hypothesis, MSCs must be prepared, characterized, gene-modified, and injected into the lung of control rats and rats with monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. In addition to determining the effect of MSCs and gene-modified MSCs on baseline pulmonary pressures and blood flow, the effects of the MSCs on pulmonary vascular responses to ventilatory hypoxia and vasoactive agonists, including acetylcholine, and the fate of the injected MSCs in the lung will be investigated using histologic and histochemical techniques. Therefore, the first specific aim is to isolate, characterize and gene-modify MSCs from the rat. The second specific aim is to investigate the effect of injected MSCs on pulmonary vascular function and on monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension using newly developed right-heart catheterization techniques. The third specific aim is to study the fate of injected MSCs in the lung using histochemical techniques, the deconvoluted microscope, and localization of the male Y chromosome in the lung of female rats using PCR and FISH methodologies. The results of these studies may lead to new MSC-based therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.","361198",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Soft tissue defects cause physical and psychosocial suffering to patients. Cancer resection surgeries of breast and facial malignancies lead to disfiguration. Injuries during war or accidents result in soft tissue wounds and defects. For decades, surgeons have utilized their creative wisdom to improve soft tissue reconstruction procedures. However, current materials and/or approaches for soft tissue reconstruction suffer from intrinsic deficiencies largely beyond the surgeon's control. Autologous (patient's own) soft tissue grafts often are the clinical gold standard, but necessitate donor site morbidity. Foreign materials for soft tissue reconstruction have witnessed various levels of clinical success, but can fail unpredictably and with severe clinical consequences as exemplified by the reported negative sequela of silicone breast implants. The surgical literature is replete with continuing aspiration to 'grow' patient's own soft tissue grafts from stem cells for reconstruction needs. Despite a small number of isolated meritorious attempts to engineer soft tissue by cell-based approaches, the effort level on soft tissue engineering lags far behind hard (bone) tissue engineering. Our preliminary data demonstrate that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) encapsulated in a biocompatible hydrogel were capable of generating adipose tissue, verified by oil- red O staining and the expression of adipogenic mRNA, PPAR-?2. The maintenance of the shape and dimensions of the engineered adipose tissue, as a clinical need specified by our plastic surgeon collaborators, were nearly 100% after 4-week in vivo subcutaneous implantation of hMSC-derived soft tissue grafts in immunodeficient mice. The overall goal of this proposal is to optimize key parameters of the engineered soft tissue grafts toward our long-term goal to develop engineered soft tissue grafts from the patient's own adult stem cells for surgical reconstruction of soft tissue defects.

resources provided by a Center grant funded by NIH/NCRR. The subproject and

and thus could be represented in other CRISP entries. The institution listed is

The overall aim of the project is to develop procedures whereby adult stem cells from the bone marrow stroma can be used for trials of gene therapy in non-human primates.  The adult stem cells, referred to as mesenchymal stem cells or marrow stromal cells (MSCs), are of interest for cell and gene therapy because they can readily be obtained from a patient, expanded in culture, genetically engineered with or without the use of viruses, and then returned for therapy of the same patient. They are also of interest because they home to damaged tissues and differentiate to replace the damaged cells in the tissues.  The cells are currently being tested in many small animal models of human diseases and several promising clinical trials with the cells have been initiated in rare diseases in children. However, extensive trials of the cells in non-human primates are clearly essential for some of the currently proposed applications to common diseases such as osteoporosis, cardiac failure, Parkinsonism, leukodystrophies, and Alzheimer's disease. The goals of the proposal are:  
Specific Aim 1.  Isolate and expand primate MSCs with the improved protocol our laboratory has recently developed to isolate and expand cultures of human MSCs. We have successfully isolated rhesus MSCs from both the bone marrow and adipose tissue.  We have done an extensive characterization of the in vitro biologic properties of the stem cell populations. Our data indicate that the MSCs from these two tissues share many characteristics. Human ASCs (hASCs) and rhesus BMSCs (rBMSCs) undergo significantly more total population doublings than human BMSCs (hBMSCs) and rhesus ASCs (rASCs). The cell cycle profile of all MSCs is altered as cultures aged in vitro. hMSCs underwent an increase in the frequency of cells in the S phase at P20 and P30. However, rhesus MSCs from both sources developed a distinct polyploid population of cells at P20, which progressed to aneuploidy by P30. Karyotype analysis of MSCs revealed the development of tetraploid or aneuploid karyotypes in the rhesus cells at P20 or P30. Analysis of the transcriptome of the MSCs from early and late passages revealed significant alterations in the patterns of gene expression (8.8% of the genes were differentially expressed in hBMSCs vs. hASCs; and 5.5% in rBMSCs vs. rASCs). Gene expression changes were much less evident within the same cell type as aging occurred (0.7% in hMSCs and 0.9% in rMSCs). Gene ontology analysis showed that functions involved in protein catabolism and regulation of pol II transcription were over-represented in rASCs, while the regulation of I¿B/NF-¿B cascade were over-represented in hBMSCs. Functional analysis of genes that were differentially expressed in rASCs and hBMSCs revealed that pathways involved in cell-cycle, cell cycle checkpoints, protein-ubiquitination, and apoptosis were altered. Overall in vitro characterization of MSCs from these two species and tissue sources revealed a high level of common biologic properties. However, the results demonstrate clear biologic distinctions, as well.
Specific Aim 2. Compare the primate MSCs in culture with human MSCs in their ability to expand rapidly and to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and neural cells.  We have found that the rhesus cells efficiently undergo differentiation along osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic lineages. The efficiency between the human and rhesus MSCs is virtually indistinguishable. In terms of neural differentiation, we have found that rhesus ASCs differentiate along this lineage with greater efficiency in vitro than human or bone marrow derived cells.

Specific Aim 3. Compare the primate MSCs to human MSCs in vivo in their ability to engraft into multiple tissues after systemic or intracranial infusion into immunodeficient mice. These studies are currently ongoing. We have injected human and rhesus bone marrow and adipose tissue derived MSCs into the CNS of NIHIII AND Twitcher (Krabbe-affected) mice, using stereotaxic delivery. We are currently assessing engraftment and differentiation of these cells in the CNS. Data from the immune deficient mice indicate the cells engraft, persist for as long as 180 days and undergo moderate differentiation along neural lineages. Data on the Twitcher mouse studies is currently being collected."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Orthopaedic trauma to bones, joints, and soft tissues currently involves over 3.6 million patients each year in the U.S. alone, and the number of injuries has been steadily increasing due to the aging population and increased levels of physical activity in older individuals. Problematic severe extremity trauma with bone loss has also recently increased dramatically due to vehicular and military injuries. This application focuses on three major common areas of orthopaedic trauma: articular cartilage degeneration associated with meniscal injuries, impaired fracture healing in the aging, and the unsolved problem of traumatic segmental bone loss.  
  
Two critical interacting regulatory signal pathyways are involved in the repair of orthopaedic bone and joint  
trauma, namely the TGF-beta/BMP pathway and the PTH/PTHrP pathway. These pathways interactively regulate differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into bone and cartilage, control the phenotypic behavior of these tissues, and constitute a unifying theme for both the basic science and clinical components of th proposed CORT. New data implicating E3 ubiquitin ligases, Smurf 1 and Smurf2, in the control of cell phenotype through degradation of BMP and TGF-beta signaling Smads, respectively, and their regulatory interactions with PTH and inflammatory cytokines, form the basis for the basic science and clinical Project aims. The CORT will involve an Administrative Core and 4 Projects, all of which utilize the research core, a Molecular and Anatomic Imaging Core. All projects involve translational approaches with animal models of injury and repair, as well as 3 clinical studies, including an RCT of PTH in fracture healing in the aging. Project 1 evaluates the role of Smurf2 in molecular events leading to OA after meniscal injury in a murine model, and in humans. Correlation with functional and quantitative MRI outcomes in humans will be studied.  
Project 2 will define the role of Smurfs and PTH in a fracture model in aging mice, to determine the molecular basis for use of PTH in stimulating fracture healing in aging patients. Project 3 will evaluate teriparatide (PTH) as a therapy for acceleration of return to function and quantitative radiographic healing of low energy pelvic fractures in aging patients, based on dramatic preliminary clinical data. Project 4 involves study of the role of Smurfs and PTH modulation of gene therapy with rAAV for allograft healing in mice, and a clinical trial of new high resolution cone beam CT scans in patients to quantify allograft vs autograft healing/vascularity.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will study the interactions of two sex hormones, FSH and estrogen, in regulating bone turnover. Our work shows that both FSH and estrogen receptors modulate bone differentiation and activity. Our findings, and those of others, show that crosstalk between these regulatory systems is mediated by secondary signals including TNFa. We will test the hypothesis that estrogen is anabolic, and FSH catabolic, for bone mass. In the menopause, estrogen drops to low levels and FSH climbs to high levels, leading to rapid bone loss. However, the relationship of FSH and estrogen receptor expression during bone cell differentiation is poorly understood. We will study this using human cells as the primary model. Knockout mice will also be used as sources of cells, and for long-term studies in vivo. Aim 1 will establish how FSH and estrogen responses are regulated during differentiation of human nontransformed osteoblast and osteoclast precursor cells. This will study the hypothesis that FSH-R, mainly in an alternatively spliced form, is expressed on osteoblast MSC precursors and on osteoclasts. In contrast, estrogen, mainly via ERa, is believed to affect osteoclasts only during differentiation, while ERa is strongly expressed late in osteoblast differentiation, where it regulates bone formation. Aim 2 will determine mechanisms of interaction of sex steroids and FSH signaling in osteoblasts and in osteoclasts. This will include quantifying the relative effects of FSH and estrogen on human osteoclast differentiation and survival. Mechanisms of cell response to FSH will be characterized. The production of TNFa, in human bone cells in response to FSH will be defined. In addition, potential counter-regulation of estrogen and FSH signaling will be studied. Effects of FSH on differentiation and survival of human osteoblasts will be evaluated, including interaction with estrogen effects. Finally, we will use a knockout mouse model to uncouple FSH-R from estrogen effects, and determine the effects on bone formation. FSH-R-/- animals will be used for studies comparing bone turnover to ovariectomized animals, with and without estrogen replacement, as functions of animal age. These studies will clarify understanding of postmenopausal bone loss, improve the ability to monitor treatment, and may improve the long-term management of hypogonadal bone disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. Women at the menopause have rapid bone loss, but estrogen replacement only partially prevents this. We discovered that the pituitary hormone FSH, which regulates estrogen production, may cause bone loss directly. We will study this FSH response in bone to provide new insights into prevention of osteoporosis.

Pulmonary hypertension is a serious, often fatal disease characterized by increased pulmonary arterial pressure, right-heart failure, and remodeling of the pulmonary vascular bed. Although current therapy has prolonged survival, the long-term outcome is not favorable. Gene therapy shows promise, however, in vivo administration of non-viral vectors or viral vectors leads to low level gene transfer, random gene expression, and adverse effects, including inflammation. MSCs are self-renewing adult stem cells from bone marrow, are easily isolated and expanded in culture, and have the potential to differentiate into many cell types. It is our hypothesis that gene-modified MSCs may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. The results of preliminary experiments in our laboratory show that the administration of gene-modified MSCs and wild-type or unmodified MSCs improve erectile function in the aged rat. The results of preliminary studies also show that intratracheal administration of wild-type MSCs attenuated monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension and restored pulmonary vasodilator responses to acetylcholine, which were impaired by monocrotaline treatment. The experiments proposed in this application will test the hypothesis that intratracheal administration of MSCs or MSCs modified with the eNOS gene or the CGRP gene will have a beneficial effect in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension in the rat. In order to test this hypothesis, MSCs must be prepared, characterized, gene-modified, and injected into the lung of control rats and rats with monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. In addition to determining the effect of MSCs and gene-modified MSCs on baseline pulmonary pressures and blood flow, the effects of the MSCs on pulmonary vascular responses to ventilatory hypoxia and vasoactive agonists, including acetylcholine, and the fate of the injected MSCs in the lung will be investigated using histologic and histochemical techniques. Therefore, the first specific aim is to isolate, characterize and gene-modify MSCs from the rat. The second specific aim is to investigate the effect of injected MSCs on pulmonary vascular function and on monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension using newly developed right-heart catheterization techniques. The third specific aim is to study the fate of injected MSCs in the lung using histochemical techniques, the deconvoluted microscope, and localization of the male Y chromosome in the lung of female rats using PCR and FISH methodologies. The results of these studies may lead to new MSC-based therapy for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.","413096",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this application is to understand osteogenic mechanisms of stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) as a basis for the development of therapeutic technologies for repairing orofacial bone defects. Autologous grafts from long bones that are commonly used to repair orofacial bone defects often result in unfavorable outcomes, which may be due, in part, to the fact that orofacial and long bones originate from neural crest cells and mesoderm, respectively, and orofacial mesenchymal stem cells show a distinctive differentiation trait from long bone mesenchymal stem cells. Previously, we showed that SHED are capable of differentiating into odontoblasts, adipocytes, and neural cells. However, one of the most distinct characteristics of SHED is their strong osteogenic capacity when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that SHED could be utilized to repair critical-size parietal defects in mice, offering an attractive stem cell resource for orofacial bone regeneration. Interestingly, our preliminary studies showed also that SHED has a gene expression profile distinct from that of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs), which correspond to the fact that SHED-generated bone structure lacks associated bone marrow elements, as seen in BMMSC transplants. Our hypothesis is that SHED, derived from neural crest cells, possesses a unique osteogenic trait and may be an optimal stem cell resource for repairing orofacial bone defects. In this application, we will examine whether a sub-population of SHED purified according to their surface molecules show superior differentiation and tissue regeneration capacities. We will characterize the distinctive osteogenic trait of SHED, such as how BMP-2 and bFGF regulate SHED-mediated osteogenesis. On the basis of our novel findings on the maintenance of BMMSCs function by telomerase, we examine how to use growth factors to activate telomerase activity in SHED for improving their tissue regeneration capacity. Finally, we develop optimal conditions to expand minipig SHED and utilize them for autologous transplantation to repair parietal defects, which is a necessary pre-clinical step to examine any efficacy and potential challenges before conducting a human SHED trial. Collectively, novel findings from our proposed studies will provide a molecular basis for understanding SHED-mediated bone formation and have important impacts in orofacial bone regeneration.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hemophilia A is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting a plasma protein, termed factor VIII (fVIII), whose function is to facilitate blood clotting. State of the art treatment of hemophilia A consists of frequent intravenous infusion of fVIII containing products. The current limitations to treating hemophilia are 1) access to fVIII products, 2) the cost of fVIII products, 3) the development of immune responses against fVIII that block treatment efficacy and 4) morbidity due to joint disease resulting from repeated bleeding into individual joints. Due to the limited amount of fVIII needed to provide clinical benefit to the patient, hemophilia A is an attractive disease for cell and gene-based therapy. This is evidenced by the fact that there have been three phase I clinical trials for gene therapy of hemophilia A conducted. In addition, it has been demonstrated that liver transplantation from a non-hemophilia A individual into a hemophilia A patient cures the disease. However due to organ shortage and transplant associated risks, treatment of hemophilia by orthotopic liver transplantation is not practical. Several investigators now have demonstrated that bone marrow-derived cells have the ability to repopulate liver tissue and express liver-specific proteins. Therefore, bone marrow-derived stem cells potentially could serve as a safe and effective therapeutic for hemophilia A. We, propose to evaluate the potential for bone marrow-derived stem cells as a treatment option for hemophilia A and identify the donor cell lineages that synthesize fVIII using a murine model of hemophilia A.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Using autologous cells and biodegradable polymers, tissue engineered pulmonary valves (TEPV) have been fabricated and have functioned in the pulmonary circulation of growing lambs for up to 20 weeks, with tissue evolving into a differentiated layered structure resembling that of native valve. More recent studies have demonstrated that use of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) and PGA/PLLA scaffolds produce functioning implants for up to 8 months in growing lambs which also demonstrated in-vivo structural evolution. These studies have demonstrated the feasibility of engineering pulmonary valve (PV) leaflets and segments of main pulmonary artery (PA) in-vitro. Both structures have functioned well without thrombosis. Moreover, both the gross and microscopic characteristics of the TEPV structures began to approximate those of normal tissues, strongly suggesting that cell phenotypes evolved in a directed fashion to remodel the valvular and vascular tissue. However, while these intriguing studies have yielded insight into TEPV development, our efforts thus far have been largely empirical. There remain significant bioengineering challenges in determining parameters that lead to optimal ECM development and strength. For example, despite the in-vivo evolution of TEPV valve tissue into a tri-layered structure that resembles native valve tissue, we have only very limited information on the extent to which TEPV truly duplicates native PV biomechanical function, nor the mechanisms that regulate the in-vivo remodeling process. The goal of the current research program is to thus quantify and simulate tissue remodeling events that occur post- implantation, and to understand the factors that influence the remodeling rate and the quality and architecture of the ultimate tissue. Specifically, we hypothesize that TEPV implant remodeling is primarily mediated by the level of in-vivo mechanical stimuli to the interstitial cells and developing ECM. Mechanical stimuli will affect the rate of scaffold degradation and the degree of post-implant cellular ingrowth. Relevance to public health includes the develop of valved pulmonary conduits for the pediatric population that can grow with the patient, minimizing the need for continued re-operations to bring the patient to adulthood.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Age-associated osteopenia/osteoporosis (Senile or Type II) develops because there is a decrease in bone formation relative to resorption resulting in net loss of bone. In association there is an increase in the amount of adipose in the endosteal cavity. Numerous studies in humans and animal models have shown that there is a strong inverse correlation between marrow fat and bone formation. Our central hypothesis is that the development of marrow fat results in decreased bone formation. Our mission is two-fold; first, to definitively prove that the development of marrow adipocytes has a deleterious effect on bone formation, and second, to understand the mechanism of adipocyte-regulated osteoblast inhibition. Given the complexities of the endosteal compartment, the influence of systemic factors, and the shared precursors of osteoblasts and adipocytes, this is an intractable problem that requires a truly unique investigative approach. Four possible hypotheses may explain how marrow adipocytes affect bone formation. First, the differentiation of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to adipocytes may limit osteoblast differentiation (H1: Differentiation shift). Second, adipose development may deplete the pool of available osteoblast stem cells (H2: MSC depletion). Third, adipocytes could secrete factors that regulate bone formation (H3: Paracrine effect). Fourth, through contact inhibition, adipocytes could affect the development or activity of new osteoblasts (H4: Contact inhibition). A unique aspect of our proposal is that we are not focused on a single hypothesis, but will address all four using ten different knockout and transgenic mice. MSC from these models will be used in a unique model of appositional bone formation whereby precursors cells are implanted in host mice to form a bone ossicle with an intact fatty-marrow cavity. We propose three specific aims: (1) To examine bone formation in models that have either increased or decreased adipocyte differentiation, (2) To examine bone formation in a model where fat can be regulated through targeted apoptosis, and (3) To examine the role of paracrine signaling by leptin, adiponectin, or PPAR-gamma agonists. If successful our study will demonstrate whether adipocytes truly impact osteoblast development or function, and further, we will demonstrate the mechanism(s) of adipo-regulation. Understanding the function of adipocytes in regulating bone formation is paramount for developing new therapies to address age-associated bone loss.

by other stem cells such as hematopoietic or mesenchymal stem cells. More importantly, ESC show a low
degree of immunogenicity by expressing little or no MHC class I antigens and no class II antigens even after
treatment with IFN-_,. Little is, however, known about the conditions under which they can optimally induce a
state of mixed chimerism that would be critical for their use in organ transplantation, but also in the treatment
of degenerative diseases, autoimmune diseases and other illnessess. In organ transplantation,
approximately 50 % of allografts are lost within 10 years by a process generally termed chronic rejection,
indicating the need for the establishment of immunological tolerance. One strategy to achieving tolerance to
transplanted organs is by creating a state of mixed-chimerism using donor-derived hematopoietic cells. The
severity of the available myelo-ablative protocols necessary for the achievement of mixed chimerism are too
severe for patient awaiting solid organ transplantation, but remain the treatment of choice for patients
suffering from malignant leukemic diseases. In contrast, most recent data in rats show that donor-type
embryonic stem cell-lines are capable of inducing mixed-chimerism and subsequent cardiac graft tolerance
without host pre-conditioning or immunosuppression. Here, we propose to test whether mouse embryonic
stem cells (ESC) induce mixed-chimerism in allogeneic combinations and tolerance to cardiac allografts
without immunosuppression or under minimal host treatment. The central hypothesis is that mouse ESC,
which are immune-privileged, establish a state of mixed- chimerism in allogeneic recipients in the absence of
pre-conditioning regimens or under minimal host treatment, in a thymus-dependent fashion, and that the
development of mixed-chimerism permits permanent engraftment of vascularized cardiac allografts. Aim 1
will establish ideal conditions for achieving ESC-induced mixed-chimerism and determine whether
established mixed chimerism induces tolerance to donor-derived vascularized cardiac allografts. Aim 2 will
deal with the mechanisms for ESC immune-privilege including determining whether ESC induce clonal
deletion of alloreactive T cells. It is anticipated that mixed-chimerism and tolerance in this mouse model will
be achieved, using this innovative approach that avoids toxic pre-conditioning regimens. The results of
these collective studies will be an important step in understanding the efficacy of ESC to engraft in
allogeneic recipients. Eventually, these data could be utilized for the induction of mixed chimerism in humans
that is is essential for tolerance induction.","94500",

morphogenesis and differentiation of the ureteric bud during kidney development. While it is established that GDNF, signaling through the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret and the co-receptor GFRalpha1, plays an essential role in this process, the downstream mechanisms remain largely obscure. We hypothesize that GDNF regulates the expression of a set of target genes, which in turn mediate the different functions of the developing ureteric bud, including growth, branching morphogenesis, differentiation into specific collecting duct cell types, and production of factors that induce the mesenchymal stem cells to undergo nephrogenesis.
In Aim 1 we propose to identify the target genes whose expression in the ureteric bud is induced or repressed by GDNF. Our preliminary data indicate that the screen will be highly effective and will allow us to identify a variety of genes with important and unforeseen roles in kidney development. In Aim 2 we propose to conduct several modified screens to investigate the mechanisms by which GDNF regulates the expression of its target genes, via different isoforms of the Ret receptor and different intracellular signaling pathways. In Aim 3 we propose a series of functional studies in mouse models to investigate the roles of
several novel GDNF target genes in renal development. The initial target genes to be examined will include a chemokine receptor that may play a role in the regulation ofureteric bud branching, a secreted cytokine that may be involved in the induction of nephrogenesis, and a transcription factor that could mediate regulation of secondary target genes. The proposed methods include loss-of-function studies using knockout and other mutant mice, gain-of-function studies using transgenic mice, as well as in vitro organ culture experiments. In addition to being a fascinating problem in developmental biology, the control of ureteric bud morphogenesis has important clinical implications, as renal agenesis, ureteral defects and renal hypodysplasia are common birth defects that can of Len be attributed to defects in the development of the
ureteric bud."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Distraction osteogenesis is a powerful tool for limb reconstruction. However, frequent problems, obstacles and complications make application of the methods difficult for patients and physicians. Among these issues, delayed or failed bone healing can be particularly problematic, requiring prolonged external fixation and/or additional procedures. A key feature of distraction is the induction of angiogenesis. Prior studies have shown that hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), a key regulator of the response to altered oxygenation and promoter of angiogenesis, is strongly induced during distraction osteogenesis. Further, we have demonstrated that increased HIF activation in bone in a mouse model increases postnatal bone acquisition. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that increased activation of HIF pathway will alter bone healing in distraction osteogenesis. We will use pharmacologic intervention to block HIF degradation, resulting in increased HIF activation and increased activation of downstream targets influencing angiogenesis. In aim 1, we will evaluate pharmacologic agents for potential to increase HIF activation and upregulate downstream targets in vitro, and select the most promising for evaluation in vivo. In the second aim, the agents will be applied locally to the distraction zone in mice undergoing distraction osteogenesis of the tibia. We will examine the distracted bones histologically, radiographically and biomechanically. Also, a second experimental group will undergo distraction at a supraoptimal rate, a maneuver that leads to delayed or non healing, to test whether increased HIF activation can allow faster distraction or lead to healing of non-unions.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this application is to engineer seamless osteochondral constructs for clinical treatment of patients with degenerated joints, in particular the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The use of a readily available, non-controversial human cell source with low immunogenicity and an FDA-approved biomaterial will facilitate the translational research phase after the core technology described in this proposal is developed. The TMJ is the focus of our attention due to the considerable morbidity of related disorders and due to the relative paucity of research attention paid to this joint that falls outside of the orthopaedic umbrella. The overall objective of this proposal is to use human umbilical cord matrix (HUCM) stem cells and microparticle technology to engineer seamless osteochondral constructs. The chief hypothesis is that using chondro-induced and osteo-induced HUCM stem cells in a novel gradient-driven scaffold design approach will lead to an osteochondral construct with superior cartilage and bony regions than either region cultured alone, resulting in a continuous transition region with a heterogeneous cartilage organization that better resembles zonal organization in native cartilage. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) to develop and characterize the novel gradient scaffold, 2) to select microparticle diameters with homogeneous scaffolds, and 3) to engineer a continuous osteochondral construct. The novel scaffolds, constructed from PLGA microparticles of discrete diameters, will be developed to provide the desired release profile of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) from homogeneous scaffolds. Growth factor activity will be ensured and ability to maintain a gradient over time will then be verified. This development/characterization phase will provide an encapsulation concentration for the growth factors in the tissue engineering phase, which will begin with a study to determine an appropriate microparticle size based on separate homogeneous osteogenic and chondrogenic scaffolds. At that stage, we will create scaffolds exhibiting two distinct gradient profiles of these growth factors with opposing concentration profiles (linear or sigmoidal) within the PLGA scaffold. Signal gradients of growth factors are a fundamental part of human development and it is probable that synthetically mimicking such gradients will be beneficial to tissue engineering. Moreover, this initial commitment to osseous and cartilaginous lineages lends to mutually inductive signals between bone and cartilage cells. The proposed research presents an innovative approach to musculoskeletal tissue engineering by utilizing a new attractive cell source and creating bioactive signal gradients via novel scaffold design.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our program is to define the molecular, cellular and physiological mechanisms that regulate osteoblast growth and differentiation, within the context of skeletal development and bone formation in vivo. Major contributions of this program to understanding bone cell biology and pathology include (i) definition of distinct developmental stages and the principal transition points that together mediate establishment and maintenance of the osteoblast phenotype, (ii) characterization of the role of Runx2/Cbfa1 and other regulatory factors in the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell growth, as well as induction and physiological responsiveness of bone-phenotypic genes during osteoblast growth and differentiation, and (iii) development of genetic models (e.g., using transgenic and gene knock-out mice) that provide the basis for bone tissue specific gene therapy. In the current funding period, we have identified BMP2 target genes that activate the Runx2 gene and play a central role in mediating osteoblast growth and differentiation. We hypothesize that analysis of the physiological regulation of the bone-related Runx2 P1 promoter will lead us to combinatorial mechanisms that integrate developmental signaling pathways to control the onset and progression of osteogenesis. Based on our preliminary results, we further postulate that BMP2, Wnt signaling and (homeodomain) proteins together contribute both to induction of Runx2 gene expression, and to functional activity of Runx2 and downstream target genes. This hypothesis will be addressed experimentally by characterizing (i) developmental regulation of the bone related Runx2 P1 gene in vivo in our Runx2 P1-LacZ knock-in mouse; (ii) Runx2 as an integrator of cell signaling through selective protein-protein interactions during distinct stages of osteoblast differentiation, and (iii) Runx2 and BMP2 dependent signaling components that mediate osteoblast commitment of mesenchymal progenitor cells. Thus, the proposed studies will advance understanding of molecular, cellular and genetic mechanisms that initiate and support complete development of the osteoblast phenotype, as well as provide the basis for clinical strategies to treat a broad range of bone-related disorders.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed R21 is to metabolically engineer a bacterial system for modified cellulose biosynthesis and establish a novel route to new families of novel polysaccharide biomaterials. Specific targets in the proposal will be the direct formation of novel copolymers of glucose-glucosamine and glucose- N-acetylglucosamine, formed with control of chemical composition achieved via genetic modifications of the host bacterial system. To achieve this goal, genetic components involved in nitrogen sugar metabolism from the yeast, Candida albicans, will be transformed into Acetobacter xylinum, the cellulose producing system. The metabolic control of nitrogen sugar incorporation in the process of cellulose biosynthesis will be the goal in Aim #1. In Aim #2, the structural features of these new hybrid biomaterial membranes based on cellulose but modified with nitrogen sugars will be determined, including mechanical properties, enzymatic susceptibility and cellular responses. Overall, this is a highly novel biomaterial formation system in which biosynthesis, polymer assembly and processing into devices (membrane mats) are directly linked, to facilitate ease of device formation from these new families of polysaccharide based systems. In addition, the ability to control chemical composition of cellulose-like biomaterial systems overcomes longstanding problems associated with cellulose due to challenges in processing plant-derived cellulose and the lack of in vivo degradability of this polymer. The novel approach to biopolymer synthesis and materials formation outlined in the planned studies will serve as a starting point for future studies in vivo with these new copolymer systems.

However, BMP specific SARA remains to be identified, and little is known about how phosphorylation of Smad1 by BMP receptors is controlled. In our preliminary data, we have found that a novel SARA, SARAb, binds specifically to Smad1. SARAb, like SARA, also has a FYVE domain and a highly conserved Smad binding domain (SBD). We have demonstrated that SARAb specifically interacts with BMP specific Smad1, not TGF-beta Smad2/3. More importantly, SARAb also has a PP1c binding domain, and we have shown that SARAb interacts with PP1c. Our data suggest that SARAb facilitates phosphorylation of Smad1 in the BMP signaling pathway. SARA possesses a dual functional role in positive and negative regulation of TGF-beta signaling. When TGF-beta ligands initiate TGF-beta signaling, SARA binds to unphosphorylated R-Smads to facilitate their phosphorylation by activated TGF-beta type I receptor. Once Smad2/Smad3 are phosphorylated, SARA then facilitates a negative regulation through binding of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) for dephosphorylation of TbetaRI. The signaling in general is a dynamic process through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. SARA(b) facilitates the dynamic mechanism to modulate TGF-beta/BMP activity with their dual functional ability. Our preliminary results have demonstrated that SARAb binds both Smad1 and PP1c in a similar way as SARA. We hypothesize that SARAb is BMP specific SARA and regulates phosphorylation of Smad1 and dephosphorylation of BMP type I receptor. The proposed studies are designed to extend our findings and characterize the molecular mechanism of SARAb-mediated BMP signaling and its role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. We will use complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches to characterize this novel SARAb-mediated BMP signaling mechanism in osteoblast cells. We will pursue: 1) characterization of the mechanisms of SARAb-mediated Smad1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of BMP type I receptor mediated; 2) examination of the effect of SARAb on BMP signaling and osteoblast differentiation in human primary stromal cells; 3) examination of the impact of osteoblast specific expression of SARAb on bone formation and turnover in vivo. Thus, modulation of SARAb, or its PP1c binding activity, will enhance BMP type I receptor phosphorylation, which could potentially serve as a bone anabolic drug target for osteoporosis.","241584",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Until recently, myocardial loss and associated functional deterioration was regarded as irreversible. Yet, accumulating evidence suggests that injected stem cells can improve function of a failing heart, giving birth to a revolutionary concept of regenerative therapy for the heart. Bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), known to differentiate into a wide variety of tissues, have shown in several preclinical models to result in improved myocardial function leading to a current human clinical trial to provide these dramatic new cell based therapies using human MSCs for myocardial repair. Hence, understanding how to enhance their therapeutic efficacy, e.g. to develop ""super"" stem cells, would expand their utility, especially in the elderly, patients with cardiac dysfunction, and in the diabetic population in whom stem cell dysfunction has been described. Using a strain that represents the upper end of the regenerative spectrum we isolated MSCs that demonstrate remarkably enhanced regenerative capacity as compared to those from C57Bl/6 (wildtype, WT) mice. The ""super"" MSCs demonstrated dramatically increased proliferation, vigorous wound tissue reconstitution, and vascular plasticity in a mouse granulation tissue model. Also, soluble factors derived from these cells caused significantly increased proliferation of fetal cardiomyoctyes and migration of endothelial cells over control conditioned media. In a murine myocardial infarct model, intramuscular peri- infarct injection of these cells showed favorable preliminary functional results over WT MSCs and control. We have identified a striking downregulation of the Wnt pathway in the ""super"" MSCs by differential expression of members of secreted frizzled related proteins and soluble Wnts as compared to WT. We verified both the relative downregulation of Wnt/-catenin signaling in MRLMSCs and that Wnt pathway inhibition enhanced MSC proliferation and granulation tissue formation, implicating this pathway as the molecular basis for the superior regenerative phenotype. We hypothesize that regulation of the Wnt signaling pathway is critical for MSC self-renewal and regenerative capacity. Moreover, we propose that modulating the activity of this pathway will recapitulate the ""super stem cell"" phenotype and is an excellent future target for cell based therapies for myocardial injuries and wound regeneration.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Angiogenesis, the sprouting of new capillary blood vessels from existing vasculature, is a complex biological process of critical importance to the treatment of numerous pathologies and the success of tissue engineering. Amongst the many promising strategies to promote angiogenesis in tissue engineering includes the controlled delivery of pro-angiogenic molecules with precise spatial and temporal control. An alternative approach is to deliver an appropriate cell type that can provide a more physiologic mixture of pro- angiogenic cues that will accelerate the recruitment of host vessels. In conjunction with two senior co- investigators, the PI has begun to explore this latter strategy in a robust, fibrin-based 3-D in vitro model of capillary morphogenesis. Using this model system, which supports the formation of stable (> 3 weeks) capillary-like structures with well-defined lumens, we have shown that capillary morphogenesis is significantly inhibited by increasing fibrin matrix density. Furthermore, we have shown that this fibrin density block is partially due to the inability of endothelial cells to upregulate a subset of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) required to locally remodel the matrix and sustain capillary invasion. However, the addition of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the 3-D tissue construct significantly enhances capillary morphogenesis, partially overcoming the inhibition caused by increased matrix density by upregulating the expression and/or activity of this subset of MMPs. Building on these preliminary findings, this new investigator Bioengineering Research Grant proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that MSCs can stimulate angiogenesis within dense 3-D fibrin matrices both in vitro and in vivo. These objectives will be achieved via three specific aims as follows: 1.) Quantify the ability of MSCs embedded throughout dense fibrin matrices to enhance capillary-like network formation in vitro. 2.) Probe the roles played by a subset of MMPs (MMPs-2 and -9 and the membrane-type MT1-MMP) in the angiogenic enhancement by MSCs. 3.) Determine the ability of MSCs to stimulate vascularization in vivo in a subcutaneous site in a SCID-mouse model. Successful completion of these studies will contribute to our fundamental understanding of the role of the ECM and MMPs in angiogenesis, and will ultimately impact the design of synthetic ECM analogs and the use of stem cells in tissue engineering applications.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Netrin family of proteins were first identified as attractive guidance cues for growing axons. Our recently-published data show they have a corresponding role in vascular guidance. There were three main results. First, Netrin-1, -2 and -4 induce migration, proliferation, and tube formation in multiple endothelial cell lines. Second, knockdown of netrinla during zebrafish embryogenesis inhibits the formation of the para- chordal vessel (PAV), which has recently been shown to be critical for forming the zebrafish lymphatic sys- tem. Third, exogenous Netrins accelerate revascularization and reperfusion of ischemic tissue in two murine disease models. Thus, using zebrafish and mammalian systems, loss-of-function and gain-of-function strat- egies, and in vivo and in vitro assays, we showed that Netrins stimulate angiogenesis. Our more recent preliminary data show that other Netrin-pathway genes (netrin2, dec, uncSb) are also required for zebrafish PAV formation; that UncSb null and endothelial-specific conditional mutant mice have a specific defect in placental angiogenesis; and that Netrins can also influence hematopoietic and mesen- chymal stem cells (HSCs and MSCs) in culture. In this revised proposal we will build on these results. Exploiting the PI and co-Pi's expertise with cell culture, zebrafish, and mouse systems, we will pursue three specific aims in parallel. Each aim addresses a separate role of Netrin function, allowing us to test for both common and divergent mechanisms during differ- ent aspects of angiogenesis. The first aim will define the role of Netrins and Netrin receptors in zebrafish PAV formation. The second aim will define the placental vascular defect in UncSb mice and address the underlying developmental mechanisms. The third aim will define the effects of Netrins on HSCs and MSCs in culture, and further test whether Netrin can direct the homing of these stem cells in vivo, providing a potential mechanism by which exogenous Netrins can promote revascularization in therapeutic models. Relevance to public health. Formation of the vascular system is critical to normal development, and vas- cular remodeling is critical during responses to injury or disease. These studies will provide fundamental in- sight into the role of Netrin signaling in vascular development and endothelial cell biology, and mechanistic insight into its therapeutic potential. The results may have particular relevance to understanding develop- ment of the lymphatic system and the placenta, and to therapies for ischemic injury.

It is one of the most dramatic applications of mechanical stimulation as a means of inducing regeneration of up to 20% of the length of a long bone. While DO procedures are used clinically and the surgical techniques have been refined, the basic mechanisms by which this procedure promotes new bone formation are not
well understood. One of the primary descriptive features of distraction osteogenesis is that it induces new bone formation through an intramembranous processes devoid of extensive amounts of cartilage. However, the most intriguing observation is that the regeneration of abundant amounts of bone is accompanied by robust vascularity of the repair tissue throughout the regenerative process. The hypothesis of this proposal is that bone regeneration during distraction osteogenesis is driven by an angiogenic process. A component of this
hypothesis is that the angiogenic events that accompany the regenerative process in distraction osteogenesis are the primary regulatory mechanisms that direct bone formation in the absence of chondrogenesis. In order to test this hypothesis and examine genetic models that will define the molecular mechanisms regulating bone formation, we have developed a murine model of DO. Initial studies will define the temporal and spatial expression of the angiogenic and bone morphogenetic signals that drive new bone formation during distraction osteogenesis and
compare the expression of these signals to those that drive the endochondral repair processes that occur during fracture healing (these will be elucidated as part of Project 4). This will be followed with experiments in which we specifically block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis using selective blocking antibodies to two different receptors of VEGF (Flk- 1 and Flt- 1), and functionally test the degree to which VEGF signals are mediators of both angiogenesis and/or new bone formation during distraction angiogenesis. We will
test, in both in vivo and in vitro experiments, the relationship of BMP-2 stimulated differentiation to the expression of VEGF(s) and the inverse effects of VEGF on the expression of BMP(s). We will then determine how selective gain or loss of BMP activity during DO affects angiogenesis and how these alterations affect the formation of bone in this system."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Successful treatment of human glioma, the most deadly brain tumor, has not been achieved in large part because of deficiencies in current delivery strategies. To improve delivery, we have exploited the unique properties of bone marrow-derived, human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) to overcome the deficiencies of current delivery methods. We have shown that hMSCs localize to gliomas after systemic and local administration. Mouse MSCs (mMSCs) behave similarly in syngeneic models that mimic transplant into immunocompetent subjects. Other studies show that tumor-derived factors, particularly PDGF-BB, may mediate the tropism hMSCs have for gliomas. Importantly, we have also demonstrated that hMSCs engineered to release interferon-beta (IFN-beta) have powerful anti-glioma effects in an animal model of this disease. On the basis of these data, we hypothesize that human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells can be used as delivery vehicles for treatment of gliomas and that hMSCs engineered to release IFN-beta are effective anti-glioma agents. To help achieve our long-term goal of applying this approach to patients, we propose a series of studies that are expected to provide fundamental biological information necessary for translating this investigational approach to patients. Thus, to test our hypothesis, we will determine the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of hMSCs within and outside gliomas by tracking donor hMSCs in sex mismatched recipient glioma intracranial xenografts; non-invasive imaging will also be used to follow in real time the fate of systemically administered hMSCs in individual subjects. Additionally, to better mimic autologous transplantation, the capacity of mMSCs to survive within and outside gliomas will be explored in syngeneic, immunocompetent mice (Aim 1). To evaluate the mechanisms underlying the tropism of hMSCs for gliomas, we will define the extent to which specific tumor-derived factors, identified during preliminary in vitro studies, contribute to the attraction of hMSCs for glioma in vivo (Aim 2). Lastly, the efficacy and toxicity of IFN-beta-engineered MSCs will be analyzed in xenograft intracranial models of human glioma and in immunocompetent syngeneic mouse model; measurements of intratumoral and systemic IFN-beta levels will define the extent to which hMSC-delivery improves the therapeutic index of IFN-beta (Aim 3).

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Collagen plays a central role as a biomaterial and as a scaffold in the regenerative tissue replacement strategies. Existing synthetic analogs of collagen have extremely poor biomechanical properties in comparison to the tissues they are targeted to replace due, in part, to the lack of orientation in hierarchical orders above the level of fibers. The overall goal of the proposed study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel biomechanically competent collagenous tissue engineering scaffold fabricated by: 1) an unconventional electrochemical process to attain an unprecedented level of molecular alignment and molecular packing density persistent across multiple levels of structural hierarchies, and, 2) the control of interfibrillar attachment by use of a biomimetic decorin-like linkage molecule. Phase 1 of proposed studies will elucidate the mechanisms by which collagen solutions achieve long-range order under the effect of weak currents applied to directly to the solutions. The effects of pH gradient electric current amplitude and collagen concentration on the hierarchical organization of collagen will be investigated to optimize the synthetic process. The strength of resulting oriented collagen gels will be improved by identifying the appropriate type and concentration of crosslinking amongst genipin and glutaraldehyde. {The D-banding pattern and collagen fibril diameter will be improved by modulating the phosphate buffered saline treatment conditions.} The viscoelastic properties of oriented constructs will be modified by decorin mimics consisting of dermatan sulfate attached to peptide motifs which selectively bind to type I collagen molecules. Mechanical properties of resulting synthetic constructs will be assessed by macroscale mechanical tests and compared to those of rat tendon, a reference natural tissue. {Phase 2 is going to assess the differentiation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell progenitors on this material towards tenocytic lineage and foster this differentiation pathway by the mechanical cue.} Overall, the proposed study will: a) optimize the fabrication process variables of a novel fabrication method to obtain highly oriented tendon-mimicking constructs, and, b) assess the feasibility of the material as a tissue engineering scaffold by investigating phenotypic and genotypic behavior of bone marrow derived stem-cell progenitors seeded within the three-dimensional structures consisting of multiple collagenous bundles. A biomaterial of this nature may play a key role in creating strategies towards replacement of load bearing connective tissues such as tendons, ligaments, bones and vascular walls provided that the current study proves its feasibility.   
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel collagenous tissue engineering scaffold with mechanical properties converging those of tendon or ligaments. The study will assess the promise of this novel material by investigating whether adult stem cells seeded on this material differentiate to act like tendon cells.

However, BMP specific SARA remains to be identified, and little is known about how phosphorylation of Smad1 by BMP receptors is controlled. In our preliminary data, we have found that a novel SARA, SARAb, binds specifically to Smad1. SARAb, like SARA, also has a FYVE domain and a highly conserved Smad binding domain (SBD). We have demonstrated that SARAb specifically interacts with BMP specific Smad1, not TGF-beta Smad2/3. More importantly, SARAb also has a PP1c binding domain, and we have shown that SARAb interacts with PP1c. Our data suggest that SARAb facilitates phosphorylation of Smad1 in the BMP signaling pathway. SARA possesses a dual functional role in positive and negative regulation of TGF-beta signaling. When TGF-beta ligands initiate TGF-beta signaling, SARA binds to unphosphorylated R-Smads to facilitate their phosphorylation by activated TGF-beta type I receptor. Once Smad2/Smad3 are phosphorylated, SARA then facilitates a negative regulation through binding of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) for dephosphorylation of TbetaRI. The signaling in general is a dynamic process through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. SARA(b) facilitates the dynamic mechanism to modulate TGF-beta/BMP activity with their dual functional ability. Our preliminary results have demonstrated that SARAb binds both Smad1 and PP1c in a similar way as SARA. We hypothesize that SARAb is BMP specific SARA and regulates phosphorylation of Smad1 and dephosphorylation of BMP type I receptor. The proposed studies are designed to extend our findings and characterize the molecular mechanism of SARAb-mediated BMP signaling and its role in osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. We will use complementary in vitro and in vivo approaches to characterize this novel SARAb-mediated BMP signaling mechanism in osteoblast cells. We will pursue: 1) characterization of the mechanisms of SARAb-mediated Smad1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of BMP type I receptor mediated; 2) examination of the effect of SARAb on BMP signaling and osteoblast differentiation in human primary stromal cells; 3) examination of the impact of osteoblast specific expression of SARAb on bone formation and turnover in vivo. Thus, modulation of SARAb, or its PP1c binding activity, will enhance BMP type I receptor phosphorylation, which could potentially serve as a bone anabolic drug target for osteoporosis.","32482",

It is mainly characterized by low bone
mineral density (BMD). BMD has high heritability of > 60%. Women have much lower BMD than men. We and others
demonstrated that some BMD genes/genomic regions are gender specific. Menopause is a most significant
physiology event in female's life and is associated with female-specific rapid bone loss.
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs), are precursors for
osteoblasts (bone formation cells) and osteoclasts (bone resorption cells), respectively.
Our hypothesis is that changes in the protein expression profiles in female BMMSCs and PBMs underlie
mechanisms of female BMD variation and are associated with menopause.
Our major goals here are to identify proteins differentially expressed in BMMSCs and PBMs in women: 1) with
high vs. low BMD; 2) before and after menopause, and thus identify proteins (and their genes) associated with
female osteoporosis and menopause in BMMSCs and PBMs. The proteins identified significant in females will be
examined in male samples.
Together with Project 2, we will recruit 80 otherwise healthy females and 80 age-matched otherwise healthy
males aged 50-55, including 40 subjects with low and 40 with high BMD (age matched population bottom or top 20%
respectively) for each sex, all Caucasian. Each female BMD group includes 20 pre- and 20 age matched
post-menopausal women. We will take fresh bone marrow (for which we have had extensive published research
experience) and peripheral blood samples from each subject. BMMSCs and PBMs will be isolated and equally
divided into two aliquots, one for Project 2 and one for Project 3. In this Project 3, we will extract the total proteins
from aliquots of isolated BMMSCs and PBMs. Proteomic profiling experiments and analyses will be performed on
Females using MD-nano-LC-MS/MS. Significant differentially expressed proteins identified will be verified by
Western blotting with female samples for their importance in females. Significant proteins verified in females will
be examined by Western blotting with male samples for sex-specificity.
The results obtained in Caucasians will be cross checked for ethnic generality/specificity in Chinese samples.
The molecular and cellular functional studies of the identified proteins and their genes will be pursued as exemplified
in Project 2 of this SCOR.
The major results (particularly those obtained from PBMs) of this study may be used to design customary
diagnostic protein antibody chips and/or protein markers for prognosis of female osteoporosis. In particular, the
results will be used to provide some functional evidence, when combined with the DMA polymorphism data in
Project 1 and DMA microarray data in Project 2 of this SCOR to powerfully and efficiently identify genes and some
of their functions for female osteoporosis."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The gonad forms as a bipotential primordium that can develop into a testis or an ovary. As it develops it reveals the remarkable plasticity of cell fate and the finely balanced signaling mechanisms that compete to establish the male or female pathway. A Y-linked gene, Sry, controls male sex determination by initiating both Sertoli cell fate determination and the morphological organization of testis cords. In the past decade, much has been learned about downstream pathways that regulate testis morphogenesis. However, little is known about how Sry initiates this process. Available data suggests that transient expression of Sry controls a cell fate decision in Sertoli cell precursors that leads to the stable expression of Sox9 throughout the Sertoli lineage. Coincident with this process, Sertoli precursors begin to aggregate around germ cells, epithelialize, and undergo a process of de novo cord formation. Our hypothesis is that the fate determination step and the mesenchymal to epithelial transition of Sertoli precursor cells are molecularly linked through stabilized expression of SOX9. Investigation of this hypothesis will be the broad direction of our work during this funding period with emphasis on four main areas of focus. (1) Based on our previous work, we will use a lineage tracing approach to investigate how Sertoli precursors arise and activate Sox9 expression. (2) We have recently found molecular evidence for the competition of antagonistic pathways during Sertoli fate determination. Using mouse mutants, we will investigate how opposing signaling pathways and transcriptional networks result in the activation of the male pathway and the repression of the female pathway. (3) We plan to determine how the polycomb group chromatin remodeling protein, M33, is involved in the establishment of ovarian or testis developmental pathways using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and M33 mutant mice. (4) We will investigate how testis cords form, and whether cord formation is linked to Sertoli cell differentiation through an interaction between SOX9 and MAP genes using live imaging, chimeric mice, markers of cell polarity and cell adhesion, and mice carrying mutations in cMaf and Mafb, members of a family shown to be critical for gonadogenesis in Drosophila, and known to interact with SOX9 during chondrogenesis in mammals.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of our research is to better understand normal in vivo mechanisms of pancreatic differentiation so that we may later apply this knowledge to the creation of engineered cells for replacement therapy and cure of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. We have focused our studies on extracellular signaling mechanisms, since such pathways could more easily be applied to the stem cell populations currently available, and preliminary data in stem cell laboratories have shown some promising early success with the ability of these stem cell populations to be manipulated toward an insulin-positive phenotype. Our laboratory has extensive experience in the study of embryonic pancreatic development and, in particular, mesenchymal influences on pancreatic epithelial differentiation and lineage selection.  In this grant proposal we wish to study the basic mechanisms of action of activin and BMP signaling in pancreatic lineage selection, as well as potential interplay between these two signaling pathways. Our central hypothesis is that these two pathways are critical to controlling endocrine (activin-induced) or exocrine/acinar (BMP-induced) differentiation, and that competition between these two pathways determines the net exocrine versus endocrine compartment differentiation in the early embryonic pancreas. In specific aim 1, we will better define the pathways and roles of activin signaling molecules and downstream smads, and then test the potential utility of activin pathways in engineering pancreatic endocrine cells from pancreatic epithelial precursor cells through simple smad-blocking studies. In specific aim 2, an analysis of specific aspects of the BMP signaling pathway and its inhibitors will be studied for a potential pro-exocrine and anti-endocrine role in pancreatic development. Lastly, since activin and BMP signaling are well known to affect one another, in specific aim 3 we will study potential mechanisms for interplay between these two signaling pathways that may contribute to overall lineage selection in the developing pancreas.  Overall, through these proposed studies, we hope to better understand the specific extracellular signaling pathways that may be usable for the manipulation of stem cells or pancreatic progenitor cells into becoming insulin-positive beta-cells for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent work has suggested that physical forces transmitted to the site of bone repair significantly influences the spatial distribution and temporal cascade of gene expression, and subsequent cell and tissue differentiation during regeneration. Despite these presumed mechano-biologic relationships and substantial experimental observations, the specific cellular and molecular events associated with the reception and response to biophysical forces remains incompletely characterized. The purpose of this research project is to investigate the mechanoresponsive cells that are involved in the fracture repair process and determine the potential regulatory role of physical forces alone or in concert with a variety of biofactors in enhancing bone regeneration. Utilizing rat models and specialized fracture fixation devices, controlled micro displacements will be applied to fractures crated in femoral diaphyseal bone. We will particularly focus on determining the cell populations that are the sensors and responders to physical forces as a function of time. In addition, using an in situ tissue engineering approach to express local biofactors, we will explore the potential synergistic mechanisms of biologic and biomechanical stimuli. The results of this work may provide us with new insights about the regulators of fracture repair. These insights may lead to the development of new strategies for increasing the rate in which fractures heal and increasing the quality of healing. This might significantly improve healthcare delivery for fractures and reduce work time lost.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latent Transforming Growth Factor-¿ (TGF-¿) Binding Protein (LTBP) is bound to TGF-P and is essential in most cells for its proper folding and secretion. In addition, LTBP localizes TGF-¿ to the extracellular matrix and helps maintain its latency until activated. TGF-¿ has many functions that have relevance to breast cancer, including growth inhibition, regulation of apoptosis, maintenance of stem cell quiescence, promotion of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and extracellular matrix deposition during radiation-induced-fibrosis. There are three TGF-¿s, all of which are expressed in the breast, and though they share the same receptors, they have distinct in vivo functions. In addition, there are three different LTBPs that can bind TGF- ¿, but nothing is known about the function of these proteins the in the mammary gland. Given the significance of TGF-¿ to both inhibition of tumor development and promotion of breast tumor metastasis, and LTBP's role as a regulator of TGF-¿, this proposal aims to determine the effects of loss of LTBP function on TGF-¿ activation and murine models of breast cancer. Due to lack of knowledge about LTBPs in breast and established links between misregulation of developmental processes and cancer development, I also propose to determine LTBP expression and loss-of-function effects during murine models of breast development. Relevance TGF-¿ is intimately linked to breast cancer in several ways: in early stage cancers, it inhibits cells from proliferating, providing protection from tumor progression; in late stage cancers, it promotes metastasis of tumor cells; it also contributes to fibrosis experienced after radiation treatment. LTBPs regulate TGF-¿ in other tissues, but nothing is known about their function in the breast. This project aims to understand LTBP expression and functions during breast development and cancer.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The thymus is the key primary lymphoid organ responsible for the generation of T cells, which provides the necessary signals and cellular environment for their survival and differentiation. Analysis of the fetal origins, developmental pathways, and molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling thymus organogenesis have provided key insights into understanding postnatal thymus function. Recently, the existence and initial characterization of a second, cervical thymus has been reported in both mouse and humans. These studies showed that the cervical thymus is a site of production for functional T cells, which can contribute to peripheral immunity. While it is clear that cervical thymus tissue exists and can generate T cells, its ontogeny remains to be elucidated. Data from these recent reports and from our lab indicate that the cervical thymus in mice is not identifiable by Foxn1 gene expression before the newborn stage, and is frequently associated with the parathyroid and/or thyroid glands. The location and timing of its appearance raise the questions of the cellular origins of the cervical thymus, the molecular mechanisms controlling its development, and what induces its postnatal appearance. Analysis of the mechanisms underlying cervical thymus formation provides a unique opportunity to understand the cellular and molecular requirements for de novo thymus formation. The variable appearance of cervical thymi in both mice and people begs the question of whether it is the potential to generate cervical thymi (i.e. presence of the progenitor cells), or the ability to stimulate their development that is variable. If it is the latter, this raises the intriguing possibility that latent thymic potential may exist in everyone, and thus may represent a novel therapeutic target for thymic regeneration and rebound. Understanding of the ontogeny and regulation of cervical thymus development is therefore critical to any future studies of the function of this organ in normal immunity, disease response, and age-related involution. In the current proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the cervical thymus arises from the same 3rd pouch derived primordium and is regulated by the same molecular mechanisms as the parathyroids and thoracic thymus. In the past 10 years, my lab has identified multiple transcription factor and signaling pathways that control the patterning and early organogenesis of the thoracic thymus and parathyroids from the 3rd pharyngeal pouch, and defined the morphological events underlying the early development of these organs, including the origin of the thymic epithelium. In the current proposal, we will use our extensive track record in the analysis of thymus and parathyroid organogenesis, using the tools and knowledge from our previous studies to investigate the mechanisms controlling the ontogeny of the cervical thymus in two Specific Aims: 1. Identify the origin of the epithelial cells in the cervical thymus in mice, to test the hypothesis that they originate from the endodermal organ primordia that give rise to the parathyroids and thoracic thymus; 2: Test whether the cervical and thoracic thymus depend on common molecular mechanisms and/or cellular interactions for their development. The thymus is the key primary lymphoid organ responsible for the generation of T cells, and is therefore critical for the establishment and maintenance of a functioning immune system. Recently, the existence and initial characterization of a second, cervical thymus has been reported in both mouse and humans. These studies showed that the cervical thymus is a site of production for functional T cells. The variable appearance of cervical thymi in both mice and people begs the question of whether it is the potential to generate cervical thymi (i.e. presence of the progenitor cells), or the ability to stimulate their development that is variable.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enamel is a mineralized tissue formed by the epithelially derived ameloblasts. The reciprocal interactions between epithelial cells of the enamel organ and dental mesenchymal cells lead to the differentiation of ameloblasts, which govern the synthesis of the enamel matrix. Studies of ameloblast function and differentiation have been limited by difficulties in isolation and maintenance of the cells in primary culture, as well as our limited knowledge of ameloblast biology. The goal of these proposed studies is to characterize ameloblast lineage cells in culture and to study their differentiation. We hypothesize that factors present in the local microenvironment of the ameloblasts will direct their differentiation and propose the following specific aims. Specific Aim1: To isolate, expand and maintain primary undifferentiated ameloblast lineage cells from single-cell colonies in vitro. Specific aim 2: To induce differentiation of ameloblast lineage cells to mature ameloblasts. Cells from the enamel organ epithelium will be cloned from single cells, characterized by the epithelial marker cytokeratin 14, and markers of preameloblasts including dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and amelogenin. Ameloblast differentiation will be induced by cell/cell interactions with dental mesencymal cells, extracellular matrix proteins, growth factors and calcium. The early-differentiated secretory ameloblasts will be characterized by upregulation of amelogenin, ameloblastin, and MMP-20. Mature ameloblasts will be characterized by upregulation of kallikrein 4 (KLK4), amelotin and Ae2. The identification of factors that drive ameloblast differentiation will allow us to better understand normal and pathological ameloblast biology, and how these cells engineer the formation of the enamel matrix. The regeneration of tooth enamel requires an understanding of the factors that control expansion and differentiation of ameloblast (enamel forming) lineage cells. In this proposal we propose to identify key factors that direct ameloblast lineage cell fate decisions as they form an enamel matrix.

In the limb, joint development starts with appearance of a mesenchymal interzone at future joint sites. Interzone progenitor cells are thought to give rise to tissues including articular cartilage and participate in joint morphogenesis, but it is not clear how the cells perform these critical tasks. The signaling proteins GDF-5 and Wnt-14 are strongly expressed by early interzone. GDF-5 was found to act as a growth and interzone determination factor, while Wnt-14 acted as an upstream regulator of interzone/early joint genes, including GDF-5 itself, Chordin and CD-44. In preliminary work we show for the first time that: Wnt-14 and GDF-5 are expressed in distinct patterns during interzone formation; peri-joint mesenchymal cells migrate into nascent interzone; GDF-5 expression becomes restricted to convex side during joint morphogenesis; and Wnt-14 signaling involves b-catenin. Our central hypotheses are: (i) interzone is made of progenitor cells derived from peri-joint sites; and (ii) GDF-5 and Wnt-14 have distinct, but interrelated roles during interzone and joint formation and morphogenesis. Our aims are to establish origin and fate maps of interzone cells, determine GDF-5 and Wnt-14 roles and mechanisms of action, and create conditionally Wnt-14-ablated mice and assess consequences. We will use cell tracing-tracking procedures, including ROSA reporter mice mated with available GDF-5-Cre mice; chimeric-microsurgical approaches; and Wnt-14 and GDF-5 gain- and loss-of-function approaches on chick and mouse autopods (paws), including those isolated from available GDF-5-null brachypodism mice and b-catenin-dependent axin-2 promoter reporter mice. The project will generate fundamental information on mechanisms of joint formation. The results will be invaluable in conceiving novel, directed and specific therapies to repair and restore malfunctioning joints common to aging individuals and otherwise affected patients.","369119",

To define the influence of specific extracellular matrix components and placental mesenchymal cells on trophoblast differentiation from human embryonic stem cells.

Our laboratory has established an in vitro model to study trophoblast differentiation.  Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) will consistently differentiate to trophoblasts and secrete high levels of placental hormones when allowed to form embryoid bodies (EBs), and are transferred into a three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix (Matrigel) environment (ECM).  Hormone secretion was enhanced in this 3D system in comparison with planar trophoblast outgrowths in standard adherent culture.

To further explore the spatial and mechanical effects of 2D vs. 3D culture, an alternative approach utilizing collagen I, a simple ECM, was employed.  The mechanical features of the ECM were changed by allowing gels containing EBs to either maintain adherence to the culture dish rendering a rigid gel, or to float in the culture media rendering a flexible gel.  In these experiments, EBs were used that had been maintained in suspension for 8 days and therefore already had a differentiated trophoblast layer.  These EBs were then mixed with collagen I forming a 3D environment or alternatively, the EBs were plated on top of the collagen I gel forming a 2D environment.  After the gels had formed, a pipette tip was used to lift the outer edges of the gels and 2 ml of media was added to ""float"" the flexible gels.  Half of the gels were ""floated"" and half were left attached to the culture dish.  HCG secretion was assayed to determine trophoblast differentiation through 30 days of culture.

Preliminary experiments revealed significantly different levels of hCG secretion between experimental conditions on particular days of culture.  EBs in 3D-Rigid gels secreted significantly higher levels of hCG on days 15 and 20 of culture compared to EBs in 3D-Flexible gels.  Also, 2D-rigid gels secreted significantly higher levels of hCG on days 8 and 10 compared to 3D-Flexible.  In addition, hCG levels were significantly higher for EBs in 2D-Flexible gels compared to 3D-Flexible gels on days 8, 10, 15, 20 and 2D-Rigid gels on day 10.  Interestingly, EBs in 2D-Flexible conditions did not differ from the 3D-Rigid conditions.  This preliminary data suggests that although some differences were observed at limited time points during culture, the most sustained difference in hCG secretion (~2 weeks) was between EBs in 2D-Flexible gels and in 3D-Flexible gels. This implies that a cell-ECM dimensional dynamic optimizes trophoblast differentiation.  Further investigation is necessary to identify if the spatial, as well as matrix-interactions encountered by EBs will induce similar signaling that is found during in vivo differentiation. This research used WNPRC Research Services, including federally approved human ES cell lines."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps. Finally, we will perform integrated data analysis to identify new epigenetic patterns in the genome that could provide insights in mechanisms of epigenetic regulation.

There is an event called ""induction"", the result
of signaling from the ureteric bud that stimulates the mesenchyme to convert into epithelia. But is this one
event or do multiple signals, working in series or in parallel drive cell conversion?
We began looking for inductive factors by making a cell line from the ureteric bud. We grew 35,000 flasks
and tested its fractions on mesenchyme taken from the rat when the UB hadjust invaded. We discovered 1.
mesenchyme dies without the UB but 2.can be rescued by UB factors and 3. can be converted when two
groups offactors are combined. We purified the following survival factors-FGF-2, TlMP-2, SHH and
endostatin. The inductive factors included LIF, lipocalin-2 (Ngal, the most highly expressed factor in acute
renal failure), a fragment of urokinase (unpublished) and a partially purified, powerful inducer we call ANX.
The inducers act like switches¿ifpresent for only 24 hrs, they drive a single mesenchyme to produce 100
tubules and recognizable nephrons. LIF was the first known purified nephron inducer.
To further our search for molecules that control conversion, we isolated 1000 tips from stalks of the in vivo
ureteric bud and we identified its secreted factors using two different species. Amazingly, one of the most
expressed tip proteins was a chaperone for LIF-like molecules, known as CLF. In fact, the embryonic kidney
likely expresses not only LIF but 2 novel cytokines, and there is good evidence for yet a third. Evaluation of
the common receptor KO shows a hypoplastic phenotype that must now be further evaluated. This was an
unexpected confirmation of our original work.
We need now to define the response of the mesenchymeto the many inducers. We show by comparison,
that a common pathway of conversion exists. We find unexpected Wnt regulators, transcription and growth
factors downstream of the inducers, which we will analyze by applying newtechniques of gene expression
and inhibition. Finally as we define the inductive pattern,we ask where do these processes really occur? Is
 polarity induced uniformly as designed by our bioassays,or have we only assayed one stage in a long
 pathway. We apply the basic ideas and tools of cell biologyto define the course of polarization and establish
a fluorescent polarity mouse to evaluate the entire transition form mesenchyme to epithelia.","317509",

DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):  
  
This application requests partial funding of a FASEB Summer Research Conference entitled Lung Epithelium in Development and Disease, to be held August 3 - 8, 2008 at The Vermont Academy, Saxtons River, VT. Attendance is limited to 160 persons to create a climate conducive to interaction among the participants. The overall objective of this conference is to provide a forum for presenting new and cutting-edge information regarding the molecular mechanisms regulating the cell and developmental biology of the normal lung epithelium, and how these may be altered in lung disease. The specific topics to be covered in this conference include: (1) Molecular regulation of lung morphogenesis and cell fate commitment; (2) New concepts in airway epithelial cell function in the normal and diseased lung; (3) Lung epithelial stem cells, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and their involvement in lung disease; (4) Regulation of surfactant homeostasis and mechanisms involved in its pathophysiology; (5) Molecular mechanisms underlying specific rare lung diseases; (6) Lung epithelial cytoprotection and programmed cell death, and the role these processes play in lung injury; (7) Molecular mechanisms mediating acute lung epithelial injury and its repair; and (8) Role of mucosal immunity in modulating the innate immune response within airways and the alveolus. We believe that this meeting is unique and highly important because it will bring together recognized experts in areas of intense interest in lung epithelial biology in a venue designed to both disseminate new information and to promote the interaction of established and junior investigators. We believe that this meeting will provide a framework for novel approaches and directions for future research on lung epithelial cell biology. The lung is the critical organ where inhaled oxygen is transferred to the blood and where exhaled carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. The airways and gas-exchanging sacs of the lung are lined by cells that make up the lung epithelium. These cells not only act in conducting air and gas exchange, but also contribute to the individual's defense against inhaled particles, pollutants, and microorganisms. The mechanisms that regulate the normal development of the lung epithelium are only partially understood. Furthermore, much remains to be learned about how the lung epithelium responds to injury and disease to restore normal function. This conference will bring together recognized experts studying many facets of lung function who will share and discuss their recent important findings, with the ultimate goal of devising better strategies for the understanding and treatment of lung disease.

I also hope to develop more useful, tractable, 3-D culture model systems recapitulating tumor architecture in vitro and ultimately to assay more closely how and why tumors invade, and the relationship of surrounding, non-dysplastic cells on this invasion.   
  
Although tumor invasion is multifaceted, I have chosen to focus my studies on a central signal-integrating molecule, FAK, focal adhesion kinase in this process. This proposal is designed in three phases:  1. Stress activation of FAK -- We will extend our studies on hyperosmotic stress-stimulation of FAK in fibroblasts to epithelial and cancer cells. This involves characterization of a novel FAK signaling pathway. Given the distinct cytoskeletal organization within these distinct cell types a detailed study of the role of Rho-family GTPases and their actin regulatory effectors on FAK signaling will be done. 2. We will define FAK domains required for epithelial adherens junction down regulation -- In this specific aim we will use this in vitro model to characterize which functional FAK domains are required for v-Src-mediated and EGF/HGF-stimulated E-cadherin phosphorylation, internalization and degradation, and adherens junction down-regulation. 3. We will establish which FAK domains are required and which are sufficient for tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vivo and in 3-dimensional (3-D) culture systems. Here we will directly test, using a xenograft tumor model in nude mice, whether FAK activation by various stimuli or mutations is sufficient, and which FAK domains are required, for human gastric and colorectal tumor invasion in vivo. Using the FAK molecule as a focal point, this proposal is designed to refine my signal transduction training and to extend my technical expertise to epithelial cell biology and cell-cell junction regulation, advanced cell imaging (in live cells) and to in vivo tumor invasion and metastasis. This K08 award will permit me to establish an independent publishing track record which is so critical to obtaining a future R01.","127170",

Little information is available regarding the role of this pathway and its mediators in lung morphogenesis. We have examined the consequences of functional deletion of Wnt5a on lung development in mouse. The mutant mice have multiple developmental abnormalities and die shortly after birth with respiratory insufficiency. Preliminary data suggest that absence of Wnt5a results in increased cellular proliferation, enhanced pseudoglandular branching morphogenesis, increased overall lung/body size ration, but inhibits the maturation of the alveolar septa (thickened interstitium). Also, expression of Shh, Ptc, Fgfl0 and Bmp4 are all increased in Wnt5a(-/-) lungs. We propose that:   
Hypothesis: WNT5a affects fetal lung development through interactions with the SHH pathway.   
Three Specific Aims are proposed to test the latter hypothesis.  
Specific Aim 1. To further investigate the role Wnt5a by generating & characterizing SpC: Wnt5a transgenic mice.  
Specific Aim 2. To determine the interactions of SHH & WNT signaling in lung development.  Specific Aim 3. To determine receptor specificity and intracellular mediators of WNT5a pathway in the lung.  
Characterization of the precise role of Wnt5a will contribute to our understanding of cell-to-cell communication and lung development. This information will be of utility in understanding the molecular mechanisms of congenital and induced lung disease.","309107",

grant we present our recent results demonstrating a role for vascular cells in early kidney development. A
population of Flk-1-expressing angioblasts appears to be crucial in maintaining mesenchymal condensates
at a level of competence that is required for the ureteric bud to induce the mesenchymal to epithelial
conversion that results in the formation of nephrons. Our present results, obtained using a novel system for
microinjecting and electroporating embryonic kidney organ cultures, demonstrates that Wt1 is able to induce
expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A). Thus, our current model suggests that Wt1
induces expression of VEGF to stimulate the angioblast population, which in turn provides an as yet
unidentified signal that acts on the mesenchyme to stimulate expression of GDNF and maintain branching
morphogenesis. The aims of this grant are designed to more fully determine the molecular nature of the
angioblast signal, and how it may be involved in stimulating branching, and patterning the embryonic kidney.","329673",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The taste periphery comprises a distributed array of taste buds innervated by distinct cranial nerves. In recent years, theories of the embryonic development of this system have undergone radical revision. Previously, taste buds were thought to be induced from indifferent epithelium by in growth of taste nerves; but new results demonstrate that early events in taste bud development occur before, and in the total absence of, innervation, raising anew questions of how taste buds develop. We now propose to examine this problem by taking advantage of the excellent molecular genetics of the mouse model system. In mice, lingual taste buds are restricted to papillae, which form by mid-gestation and likely contain taste bud progenitors; yet taste buds proper do not appear until postnatal stages. Two signaling factors (Sonic Hedgehog [Shh] and Bone Morphogenetic Proteins [BMPs]) are expressed in a subset of papillary epithelial cells, and both pathways influence murine taste development. Our preliminary data suggest that the Shh- expressing cells may be taste bud stem cells. And our newest findings implicate yet another, crucial signaling system, the Wnt pathway, in taste organ development, as gain or loss of Wnt signaling in embryonic tongues significantly affects papillae. Interactions of these 3 signaling pathways (Wnt, Shh and BMP) are known to drive development of many other epithelial specializations, including hair, feather and teeth, but their precise roles in taste organ development are unknown. With a nerve-independent view of early taste organ development, and a molecular genetic approach, we are now poised to work out the molecular mechanisms governing development of this vital sensory system. In the following 3 aims, we will test the overall hypothesis that: Taste buds originate from embryonic Shh-expressing stem cells whose development is regulated by interactions of the Wnt, Shh and BMP pathways. Aim 1: Ascertain whether embryonic Shh-expressing taste placode cells are taste bud stem cells. Aim 2: Determine how Wnts interact with BMP and Shh to regulate taste organ development. Aim 3: Test if epithelial Wnt signaling is sufficient for taste organ development. Successful completion of these aims is important for issues of human health related to taste function, as well as more generally to enhance knowledge of embryonic development and its misregulation.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent work has suggested that physical forces transmitted to the site of bone repair significantly influences the spatial distribution and temporal cascade of gene expression, and subsequent cell and tissue differentiation during regeneration. Despite these presumed mechano-biologic relationships and substantial experimental observations, the specific cellular and molecular events associated with the reception and response to biophysical forces remains incompletely characterized. The purpose of this research project is to investigate the mechanoresponsive cells that are involved in the fracture repair process and determine the potential regulatory role of physical forces alone or in concert with a variety of biofactors in enhancing bone regeneration. Utilizing rat models and specialized fracture fixation devices, controlled micro displacements will be applied to fractures crated in femoral diaphyseal bone. We will particularly focus on determining the cell populations that are the sensors and responders to physical forces as a function of time. In addition, using an in situ tissue engineering approach to express local biofactors, we will explore the potential synergistic mechanisms of biologic and biomechanical stimuli. The results of this work may provide us with new insights about the regulators of fracture repair. These insights may lead to the development of new strategies for increasing the rate in which fractures heal and increasing the quality of healing. This might significantly improve healthcare delivery for fractures and reduce work time lost.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of fibrosis represents a critical parameter of airway remodeling, and likely is the outcome of numerous signaling cascades operative in different cell types. The pro-fibrotic cytokine, transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-1) plays a cardinal role in the development of fibrosis, and the outcome of TGF-1 induced signaling is highly dependent upon the cellular environment, and the cooperation with other signaling pathways. Exciting new preliminary studies from our laboratory have identified a critical role for c-Jun-N- terminal-kinase (JNK) in augmenting the pro-fibrotic effects of TGF-1, in association with the causation of a mesenchymal transition of airway epithelial cells (EMT). We have demonstrated that; 1) JNK is predominantly activated in airway epithelium from ovalbumin sensitized and challenged mice; 2) Mice lacking JNK1 (JNK1-/-) fail to induce mesenchymal genes or develop fibrosis in response to ovalbumin challenge or TGF-1, or bleomycin administration; 3) Primary tracheal epithelial cells derived from JNK1-/- mice are refractory to TGF-1-induced expression of mesenchymal genes and proteins; and 4) TGF-1 induced epithelial-to mesenchymal transition requires JNK1. Our data, suggest a critical role of airway epithelium-derived JNK- dependent signals in orchestrating airways fibrosis. The hypothesis of this proposal is that activation of JNK1 in the airway epithelium is required for the development of subepithelial fibrosis in murine models of airway remodeling by promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We hypothesize that JNK1 enhances TGF-1 signaling, via coordinated linker phosphorylation of receptor SMADs, and phosphorylation of c-Jun, resulting in enhanced expression of mesenchymal genes, critical to TGF-1-induced fibrosis. In Specific Aim #1, we will determine the requirement for JNK1 in TGF-1-induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition in primary cultures of tracheal epithelial cells. In Specific Aim #2, we will determine whether increases in mesenchymal gene expression in airway epithelium, and development of subepithelial fibrosis in mice require a JNK1-TGF- signaling axis. Specific Aim #3 proposes to elucidate the relative importance of JNK1- dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun or rSMADs linker regions in augmenting TGF-1 induced signaling, whereas Specific Aim #4 will unravel whether JNK1 activation, c-Jun and SMAD3 linker phosphorylation, and subsequent c-Jun and SMAD4 dependent transcriptional responses within the airway epithelium are critical in the orchestration of OVA or TGF-1-induced airways fibrosis. The outcome of our study, which is based on cell culture and genetically altered mouse models, will provide a better understanding of the molecular signals that lead to collagen deposition (scarring) of airways, and the relevance of epithelial cells in this process. Project Narrative: Epithelial cells that line the airways (breathing tubes) are now well known to play a critical role in the defense against inhaled materials, and are important in maintaining normal lung function. However, our laboratories have identified that epithelial cells play a negative role in promoting stiffening of the lung tissue, thereby decreasing lung function. We have identified some critical biochemical signals that promote this possibly negative event. Project Narrative: This grant proposal has four specific aims to test the importance of these biochemical signals in lung stiffening, and will use primary cell cultures from mouse airways, a human epithelial cell line, and the construction of genetically altered mice. Completion of this project will provide new insights into the process of lung stiffening, and may lead to the development of new therapeutics to limit lung stiffening, and also potentially reverse this process.

followed by aberrant healing. The interactions between lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts are key
determinants of normal healing or the progression of fibrosis. One of the secreted factors that is believed to
play a role in the maintenance of lung epithelial integrity is keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) which acts on
epithelial cells. Overexpression KGF in the mouse lung provides protection against bleomycin (bleo)-induced
lung fibrosis. Our preliminary data indicate that KGF induces expression of the chemokine genes CXCL9,
CXCL10 and CXCL11 in the lung that have been previously shown to protect from fibrosis in animal models.
KGF treatment of epithelial cells in vitro results in STAT1 phosphorylation that may underlie the increased
KGF-induced expression of the specific chemokines. KGF+bleo-treated Tg mice were found to display
increased cytoplasmic and nuclear presence of D-catenin in lung epithelial cells. The expression of multiple
members of the Wnt/D-catenin signal transduction pathway, was significantly upregulated in the lungs of
these mice. We have also observed that KGF prevents the evolution of epithelial cells toward a myofibroblast
phenotype. Finally, KGF treatment of lung epithelial cells prevents TGF-D1-mediated downregulation of Id1
protein, a known inhibitor of myogenesis. Based on these data, our hypotheses in this proposal are: 1.
Factors induced by KGF in epithelial cells such as CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11 inhibit pulmonary fibrosis.
2. KGF attenuates pulmonary fibrosis by fostering normal epithelial regeneration. 3. KGF antagonizes TGFD-
induced signaling mechanisms in epithelial cells that in turn inhibit differentiation towards a fibroblastic
phenotype. To test these hypotheses we will:
Aim I. Characterize the role of the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11, and of IFN-D and STAT1 in
KGF-mediated protection from bleo-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
Aim II. Characterize the role of Wnt/D-catenin signaling in KGF-mediated inhibition of the effects of TGF-D1
on epithelial cells.
Aim III. Characterize the role of inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1) molecule in KGF mediated protection from
bleomycin induced pulmonary fibrosis."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hyaluronan (HA) and proteoglycans (PGs) are major extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the developing endocardial cushions of the heart. They have been demonstrated to play an important role in regulation of endocardial-to-mesenchymal transformation. We have recently determined that Cartilage link protein 1 (Crtl1) is expressed in the heart as well. Crtl1 mediates the binding of HA to PGs and is best known for its role in stabilizing the hyaluronan/aggrecan complex in cartilage. In the mouse heart, Crtl1 expression was found in the endocardium and in the endocardially-derived atrioventricular (AV) cushions where it is, not surprisingly, largely co-localized with versican and HA. Thorough analysis of the cardiac phenotype of the Crtl1 knock out mouse demonstrates that, at early stages, Crtl1-/- animals are characterized by a spectrum of cardiac abnormalities, including thin myocardial walls and under-developed ventricular septa. Late fetal and neonatal mutant mice display a spectrum of valvuloseptal abnormalities, including muscular ventricular and atrioventricular septal defects. From our observations, we infer that Crtl1 is an important component in the extracellular matrix of the developing heart where it plays a significant role in the development of myocardial structures and endocardial cushion tissues. In specific aim 1 we plan to determine the role of endocardially-expressed Crtl1 in early stages of cardiac development. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that, as a result of the absence of Crtl1, the balance between myocardial proliferation and apoptosis is disturbed. In aim 2 we have designed experiments to determine how Crtl1, in combination with its binding partners hyaluronan and versican, is involved in regulation of early myocardial development. Finally, in aim 3 we will investigate whether Crtl1 plays a role in EMT and/or in the regulation of post-EMT events in the endocardial cushions of the developing heart. Relevance of project: Each year, nearly twice as many children die in the US from congenital heart disease as die from all forms of childhood cancers combined. Almost all abnormalities found in CHD involve the valvuloseptal complex. Understanding the role of Crtl1, and Crtl1-associated mechanisms, in heart development may further our knowledge of the etiology of a variety of these malformations including the mechanisms that lead to muscular septal defects.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
We are studying dorsal CNS pattern formation in the mouse, as a paradigm for human congenital brain malformations based on the hypothesis that similar patterning defects underlie mouse and human malformations. Pattern formation is the term used to describe the emergence of spatial biological organization during development. Malformations of the dorsal midline of the human CNS are poorly understood congenital defects that include some forms of holoprosencephaly and megalencephaly. Both of these are primarily malformations of the dorsal cortex. An example of a dorsal midline malformation of the cerebellum is Dandy-Walker Malformation. The roof plate is a specialized dorsal midline structure in the embryonic CNS. It is a crucial regulator of dorsal patterning information in the developing spinal cord, directing the specification and differentiation of dorsal sensory interneurons via secreted molecules. We hypothesize that the roof plate performs a similar function in more anterior levels in the brain. Specifically, we hypothesize that the Lim-homeodomain encoding genes, Lmx 1a and Lmx 1b are required for normal roof plate development in the anterior CNS and that loss of these genes leads to loss of roof plate function and subsequent abnormal specification and differentiation of adjacent neurons in the developing cerebellum and cortex. We have previously demonstrated that the spontaneous neurological mouse mutant, dreher, harbors mutations in the Lmx 1a gene and that Lmx 1a is required for roof plate development in the mouse CNS. In the dreher spinal cord, no roof plate is generated. Consequently, the specification, patterning and differentiation of adjacent dorsal sensory interneurons are abnormal in the dreher spinal cord. At anterior levels of the developing CNS, a residual roof plate is still present in dreher mice, suggesting that roof plate in the brain has a different mechanism of genesis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exercise is perhaps the single ""intervention"" recognized as a deterrent to both osteoporosis and obesity, yet the manner in which mechanical signals inhibit their pathogenesis remains unknown. Brief daily periods of high frequency (30-90 Hz), low magnitude (<0.4g) mechanical signals (LMMS) are anabolic to both bone and muscle. In an unexpected finding, these signals also suppress adipogenesis, with 29% less total visceral abdominal fat in mice subject to 12w of LMMS. The starkly distinct response of these tissues (?bone & muscle; ?fat) to LMMS suggests that these signals influence the differentiation pathway of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Translated to the human, this would help explain why a sedentary lifestyle is permissive to both osteoporosis and obesity, seemingly distinct diseases, and could suggest that LMMS reduce adipogenesis and strengthen the musculoskeletal system as much by defining the fate of MSCs as influencing the resident cell population within bone, muscle, or fat. We hypothesize that LMMS drive MSCs towards a bone and muscle phenotype, simultaneously suppressing a path towards adiposity. Three specific aims are designed to better understand the means by which LMMS influences the body composition of the growing, aging, obese and diseased animal: 1. To identify those genes involved in the tissue response to LMMS, young male B6 mice will be subject to daily LMMS, and early through late (4d, 6 & 12w) expression levels of 96 candidate genes in marrow, fat and bone, representing those involved in regulating these tissues, will be correlated to alterations in bone and fat mass, and compared to baseline and age matched control. 2. The long-term phenotypic impact of LMMS, and their ability to influence dietary and genetic models of obesity, will be defined at 3 & 6 months in healthy male B6 mice fed a normal or high-fat diet (Diet Induced Obesity), as well as a transgenic strain of mice prone to adiposity (leptin-deficient ob/ob). The status of marrow, fat and bone, and level of triglycerides and free fatty acid in the serum, liver, muscle and adipose tissue, will be quantified and compared to controls. 3. To determine if LMMS influences the differentiation pathway of MSCs, irradiated C57BL/6J mice (B6) transplanted with marrow from GFP+ donors will be subject to LMMS, and following 6 & 12w, the number of GFP+ cells in fat, marrow and bone will be compared to age matched recipient GFP+ controls. To establish if MSCs can be independently influenced by LMMS, the ability of these signals to suppress adipogenesis and promote osteoblastogenesis will be evaluated in MSC cultures (C3H10T1/2) using an in vitro system used to deliver LMMS. Together, these studies will help define how the musculoskeletal, adipose and stem cell systems respond to subtle changes in their mechanical environment, and represents a step in establishing a non-drug means of inhibiting osteoporosis and obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Augmentation of Trabecular Bone by Low Magnitude Strain This work will investigate the mechanisms behind the anabolic potential of extremely low- magnitude mechanical signals, and how they strengthen both bone and muscle. Research over the last period of funding has also shown that these signals markedly suppress adiposity, by influencing the differentiation pathway of mesenchymal stem cells rather than elevating the animal's metabolism, indicating a previously unrecognized mechanical means of the regulating fat and bone production.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proximate obstacle to realizing the enormous potential benefits of adult stem cell-based regenerative therapeutics is to safely and efficiently deliver the cells where they are needed/required. Though direct injection of adult stem cells into site(s) of disease/injury is feasible for certain organs with defined anatomic boundaries (e.g., heart), direct insertion is impractical for systemic conditions such as generalized bone diseases (e.g., Osteogenesis Imperfecta). Tissue-specific migration of blood-borne cells is initiated by adhesive interactions at target tissue endothelium mediated by molecules on circulating cells that are specialized to resist the shear forces of blood flow, the ""homing receptors"". Recruitment of cells from the vascular compartment to bone occurs within marrow, mediated by homing receptors bearing sialofucosylated lactosaminoglycans that engage E-selectin, a Cadependent lectin that is constitutively expressed on marrow sinusoidal vessels. In the prior funding period, we analyzed the expression of homing receptors on subsets of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). We found that whereas human HSPCs express multiple homing receptors, including several glycoproteins that function as E-selectin ligands, BMSCs express no E-selectin ligands and only two characterized homing receptors, VLA-4 and CD44. Importantly, however, we observed that CD44 on BMSCs possesses a(2,3)-sialyllactosamine carbohydrate modifications that can serve as an acceptor for exogenous fucosylation. Using a novel alpha-(1,3) fucosyltransferase enzyme and attendant buffer conditions specifically formulated by us for treating BMSCs without affecting cell viability or multipotency, we converted the native CD44 glycoform into HCELL, a highly potent E-selectin ligand. In flow-based assays, HCELL* BMSCs displayed profound adhesive interactions on E-selectin, and, as observed by real-time intravital microscopy in immunocompromised mouse hosts, intravenously infused HCELL* BMSCs homed robustly to bone, with infiltrates evident within hours of infusion. Thus, stereoselective glycan engineering of a single membrane glycoprotein can direct navigation of BMSCs to a predetermined anatomic compartment. In this renewal application, we will extend these exciting findings to further optimize adhesive interactions and transmigration of human BMSCs on endothelium expressing E-selectin. We will also examine the biological effects of improved trafficking of BMSCs to marrow, and will analyze the discrete glycan structures created by enforced fucosylation. We anticipate that results of these studies will unveil a readily translatable roadmap for programming osteotropism of human BMSCs, thereby facilitating clinical use of these cells for treatment of generalized skeletal diseases and for enhancing engraftment following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

preserved and how early differentiation decisions are made.
These studies focus on the role of PI3K in promoting GSK3-beta activity, a point of regulation that is critical
for blocking an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and differentiation towards mesendoderm. Control
of mesendoderm development, following loss of PI3K and GSK3-beta activity, is not well understood. To
address this issue, respective roles for Wnt and TGF-beta family members in mesendoderm specification will
be defined. Understanding these issues is critical not only in relation to hESC self-renewal, but also for
understanding the basic mechanisms underpinning early cell fate decisions, including definitive endoderm
and mesoderm specification from a mesendoderm precursor.
The first Aim of this Project will investigate the role of GSK3-beta in control of EMTs and how it regulates the
activity of two transcription factors, Snail 1 and beta-catenin. Mechanisms by which these transcription factors
control EMTs will be defined.
The second Aim will investigate the signaling pathways required for hESC self-renewal and specifically, how
PI3K maintains GSK3-beta activity and inhibits an EMT.
The third Aim, will establish the exact conditions for early cell fate commitment to mesendoderm and how
Wnt and TGF-beta synergize to pattern this cell type. Finally, we will investigate the use of GSK3-beta
inhibitors as compounds that can promote uniform differentiation of hESCs.
Understanding the mechanisms of hESC self-renewal is critical if we are to harness their full potential as a
developmental model and as a therapeutic source of cells that can be used in regenerative medicine. Our
understanding of hESC differentiation into different lineages is only poorly understood. This proposal will
focus on a very early stage of cell fate commitment that is critical for differentiation into two key lineages.
First, mesoderm which can give rise to blood, muscle and bone. Second, definitive endoderm which gives
rise to pancreas, liver, lung, intestine and thyroid."," ",

A consequence is the formation of mucus plugs in small airways, which are sites of recurrent infection. These plugs also bring about oxygen insufficiency. The lethality of each of the above conditions is directly linked to the presence of excessive mucus. The substrate for hypersecretion is the pathological growth of airway mucus glands, which is reflected in increased gland:wall ratios consistently found at autopsy in these patients. The molecular
mechanisms responsible for initiating gland growth in adult airways are unknown, but once understood, could open the way for drug development to help these patients. Based on our preliminary data and its similarity to findings in other systems, we propose that Mycoplasma elicits a convergence of stimuli at epithelial mesenchymal junctions leading to Lef-1/beta catenin overexpression and subsequent changes in gene expression in select epithelial cells. Among the genes so affected are E-cadherin and EMMPRIN. While downregulation of E-cadherin promotes bud formation by weakening adherens junctions, upregulation of EMMPRIN can be expected, based on our in vitro observations, to increase motility of the non-adherent cells.
In Aim 1, we will examine the dependence of gland bud formation on Lef-1, beta catenin, wnt and EMMPRIN, using selective siRNAs directed against each protein both in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that Lef-1/beta catenin upregulation in gland buds is directly responsible for upregulation of EMMPRIN, whose promoter indeed contains putative Lef1-beta catenin response elements. In Aim 3, we will identify the molecular changes in EMMPRIN-overexpressing epithelial cells contributing to the hypermotile phenotype. The results of the proposed studies should provide a molecular model of mucus gland formation in lung disease and suggest novel targets for the development of drugs to block hypersecretion and prolong life."," ",

It is thought that airway narrowing associated with asthmatic episodes results in the transmission of deleterious mechanical forces directly to the bronchial epithelium and it has been shown that these compressive forces augment the release of proinflammatory and profibrogenic mediators from these cells in culture. The additive effect of repeated episodes is thought to induce airway remodeling and collagen deposition by mesenchymal cells of the airway wall resulting in the altered and undesirable airway characteristics seen during asthma.  We have developed a device capable of applying compressive forces to epithelial cells in culture thought to be experienced by the pulmonary epithelium during airway narrowing in-vivo, as well as the novel capability of delivering prescribed pressure oscillations that we believe more accurately mimic the forces delivered to the airway epithelium during an acute asthma attack.  To characterize these effects, normal human bronchial epithelial (NHLB) cells will be subjected to a single or multiple exposure to 4 hours of static or oscillatory pressures and the media will be assayed for transforming growth factor-¿¿2, endothelin 1 and 2, and fibronectin.  Gene expression of these proteins will also be characterized.  NHLB cells will then be exposed to the conditions described earlier in the presence of normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) to characterize the epithelial-mesenchymal relationship during compression induced cell injury.  Gene expression of collagen (I, III and V), tenascin and fibronectin will be assessed and multiphoton laser scanning microscopy will be utilized to quantify collagen deposition by NHLF cells in culture.  This study will allow us to examine the effects of compression induced cell injury on the bronchial epithelium and will provide insight into the epithelial-mesenchymal relationship during asthma related injury and its involvement in the development of fibrosis.  The ultimate goal of these studies is to aid in the development of pharmacologic interventions to impede the progression of airway remodeling and fibrosis during chronic asthma."," ",

progression. Several factors associated with EMT contribute to motility, invasion, and angiogenesis, and may
be important therapeutic targets for prostate cancer metastasis. Understanding the factors that contribute to
EMT and prostate cancer metastasis is crucial for development of cancer therapies. For example, Snail
transcription factor has been identified as an important factor that can induce EMT in breast and colon
cancer. However, the role of EMT in prostate cancer is not well defined and good EMT models are lacking.
Recently we have established an EMT model for prostate cancer progression using the ARCaP cell model
overexpressing Snail. The goal of this proposal is to study the role of Snail transcription factor in prostate
cancer progression and metastasis. We have found that Snail-induced EMT in prostate cancer cells involves
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and receptor activator of NFDB (RANKL), two factors that are important in
cancer disease progression and bone metastatic lesions, respectively. For this proposal, will elucidate the
biological significance of Snail with emphasis of its role in bone turnover. In addition, we will characterize the
signaling pathway of Snail-induced EMT, and finally examine the effect of antagonizing Snail expression on
tumor aggressiveness in vitro and in vivo. We believe these studies will identify Snail as an attractive
therapeutic target not only for EMT during primary tumor progression but also for bone metastatic lesions at
the secondary site."," ",

Two studies examined the clinical spectrum and natural history of FD.  The first, by Hart el al, characterized the onset, progression, and plateau of skeletal lesions in FD, and how the extent of disease correlated with functional outcomes.   The second, by Kelly et al, examined pain in FD; the extent and natural history of painful skeletal disease, and which treatments were effective.  

In the study by Hart et al, we evaluated 109 subjects with FD who had been studied at the NIH for up to 32 years.  We found that 90% of the skeletal disease burden was established by age 15.  Disease was established in a region-specific pattern: 90% of the lesions were established in the craniofacial region by 3.4 years, in the extremities by age 13.7, and in the axial skeleton by age 15.5.  Twenty-five out of 103 subjects eventually required ambulatory aids.  The median age at which assistance was required was 7 (range 1-43).  The median bone scan score for subjects requiring assistance was 64.3 (range 18.6-75) compared to 23.1 (range 0.5-63.5) in the unassisted subjects (p<0.0001).  Amongst subjects requiring assistance with ambulation, 92% demonstrated this need by 17 yr.  This study established that the majority of skeletal lesions and the associated functional disability in FD occur within the first decade of life.  The implication is that the window of time for preventative therapies is narrow, and that studies designed to do so must begin treating subjects at an early age.  In addition, these data also allow clinicians to reassure most parents that their children will not progress to significant dysfunction.  
       
While pain was known to be associated with FD, its prevalence and severity, and which skeletal sites are most likely to be painful was not known.  In this study, we set out to determine prevalence, severity, and distribution of painful skeletal lesions, what the natural history of the pain was, and what treatments were effective.  This was a cross sectional, retrospective review of the NIH cohort of patients with FD.  We studied 35 children and 43 adults, and found that pain at sites of FD was common, reported by 67% of the population.  Pain was more common and severe in adults than in children (81% and 49%, respectively p<0.005, severity 4.1/10, and 2.8/10, respectively, p<0.01). Surprisingly, there was no correlation between pain severity and skeletal disease burden.  A disturbing finding was that children were more likely than adults to be untreated for pain (44% vs. 26%).  We concluded that pain, which was sometimes severe, was common in FD and was often under-treated, especially in children.  The prevalence and severity of pain was greater in adults, but was unrelated to the burden of FD.  The increase in pain is neither due to more fractures, which are more common in children, nor to the development of new FD lesions, which was not a significant feature of aging.

In a study by Celi et al, we set out to define the clinical characteristics and molecular etiology of thyroid disease in MAS.  To do this, we retrospectively examined the clinical data on 100 patients with MAS, and performed a series of ex vivo and in vitro experiments.  Using abnormal ultrasound findings as the most sensitive test for thyroid involvement, we found the prevalence of thyroid disease in this cohort was 54%.  Patients with thyroid disease had a higher ratio of the active thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3) relative to its precursor, thyroxine (T4).  A possible mechanism of this finding is the intrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 by 5-deiodinase, likely driven by higher intracellular levels of cAMP due to mutations in GNAS.  To test this hypothesis, we performed ex vivo experiments in which we measured 5-deiodinase activity in thyroid tissue from patients with MAS and controls.  We found that the tissue had both higher type-1 (D1) and type-2 (D2) deiodinase activity; D1 control enzymatic activity was 5.9 +/- 4.5 fmol/min/mg vs. MAS 41.7 +/- 26.8, p<0.001; D2 control enzymatic activity was 28.3 +/- 13.8 fmol/min/mg vs. MAS 153.1 +/- 43.7, p<0.001.  We further studied this by performing reconstitution experiments in which we established a stable HEK-293 cell line that carried a cAMP-dependent type-2 5-deiodinase that was transfected with wild type and disease-causing R201H or R201C Gs-alpha mutants.  The basal transcriptional activity of the D2 promoter was significantly increased in both mutants (C and H) (R 10733 +/- 2855, vs. C 18548 +/- 4514, vs. H 19032 +/- 4410 RLU +/- SD, p<0.001), indicating that the shift in T3/T4 ratio is at least in part secondary to a cAMP-mediated intrathyroidal activation of D2 and to elevated D1 activity.  While it remains to be tested, a therapeutic implication of these data is that propylthiouracyl, which, unlike methimazole is a potent inhibitor of D1, would offer an advantage over methimazole in the treatment of MAS-associated thyroid disease. 
      
 

Disorders of mineral metabolism

Studies of diseases manifested by hypo- and hyperphosphatemia have been informative in efforts to dissect the molecular pathways involved in FGF23 production and activity.  Hyperphosphatemia caused by low levels of intact FGF23 may be due to mutations in FGF23, N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GALNT3), or KLOTHO.  The diseases caused by these mutations are either familial tumoral calcinosis (FTC) or hyperostosis-hyperphosphatemia syndrome (HHS).  Phenotypically, these two disorders have been distinguished by the fact that FTC is associated with subcutaneous calcific masses, and HHS with painful diaphyseal hyperostosis.  While it has been shown that FTC can be due to mutations in FGF23, GALNT3, or KLOTHO, those cases that have been phenotypically characterized as HHS have only been shown to be caused by mutations in GALNT3.  We described a new case of FTC/HHS that revealed a phenotype with aspects of both FTC and HHS, as well as several novel findings.  Serum phosphorus was 7.3 mg/dl (normal, 2.5-4.8), and elevated renal phosphate reabsorption (TmP/GFR 6.99 mg/100 ml, normal 2.97-4.45).  Radiographs revealed tooth anomalies, thyroid cartilage calcification, calcific masses in vertebral spaces, calcification of the interstitial septae of the soft tissue in the lower extremities, and cortical thickening of the long bones.  Bone density was elevated with a total hip Z-Score of 1.9.  C-terminus serum FGF23 was elevated at 1210 RU/ml (normal, 20-108), but intact FGF23 was low at 7.4 pg/ml (normal, 10-50).  DNA sequencing determined the patient was a compound heterozygote for mutations in GALNT3.  Since we have previously demonstrated the dependence of FGF23 action on parathyroid hormone (PTH), which signals through cAMP, we tested the effect of two medications known to increase renal tubule intracellular cAMP on phosphate metabolism.  Treatment with niacinamide and acetazolamide decreased TmP/GFR and serum phosphate, which was paralleled by a decrease in serum C-terminus FGF23.  This case broadens the spectrum of phenotypic and genotypic features of FTC/HHS, and suggests treatments to decrease renal phosphate reabsorption in the setting of a low intact FGF23.","1726958",

formation of fat cells. Obesity is a major health care problem in the United States and is closed associated
with many health problems such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and especially diabetes.
Obesity occurs when energy input exceeds energy expenditure, resulting in more fat cells and larger fat cells.
The first step in fat production involves proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells, followed by differentiation into
fat cell precursors called preadipocytes. Preadipocytes then migrate and proliferate at the site of fat production,
where they differentiate further to become spherical adipocytes. This multi-step process is regulated by
numerous hormones and is accompanied by dramatic changes in cell shape and gene expression. We have
recently identified a critical switch in gene activity from integrin alpha5 to integrin alpha6. That switch allows
preadipocytes to cease dividing and cluster, forming bona fide fat cells. Integrins are cell surface proteins that
are involved in binding to a meshwork of proteins outside of cells that can influence their behavior. Many
things happen in the generation of fat cells and we believe that the transition from one integrin to another is a
crucial step. Here we propose experiments to manipulate those two integrins and examine the effects on the
formation of fat cells. The fuller understanding of what happens in fat formation opens new avenues for
treatment of obesity and diabetes.","146500",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone regeneration is of enormous importance, particularly in the oral and craniofacial region. Trauma, including surgical removal of tumors in the oral and maxillofacial region, causes bone damage and injury. Congenital disorders may carry severe tissue defects that interfere with normal function and are often disfiguring. The ultimate therapeutic goal for these diseases is regeneration of the tissues to a normal or pre-disease state. Our long-range goal is to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the regeneration of dental and craniofacial tissues and to further the development of products for skeletal regeneration and tissue engineering. The objectives of this application are to determine the source and potential of adult stem cells in tissue regeneration and to elucidate the roles of osterix (Osx), a critical osteogenic transcription factor, in the differentiation of bone- and dentin-forming cells. The central hypotheses to be tested are that marrow-derived cells are capable of regenerating oral craniofacial tissues and Osx stimulates the normal cascade of bone anabolic behavior. The rationale is based on the evidence that the conversion of marrow-derived non-differentiated mesenchymal stem cells into mature and functional osteo- and odonto-blasts is a crucial step in bone and dentin formation, as well as in regeneration. Aim 1: To determine the differentiation potential and histogenesis of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in oral craniofacial regeneration. Using a cell-based approach, the genetically labeled BMSCs will be introduced into oral, dental and craniofacial wounds and, for the first time, the cell differentiation, migration, and subsequent bone and dentin formation in a live animal will be documented. Aim 2: To determine, in vivo, the effects and mechanisms of Osx in promoting BMSC differentiation in bone regeneration and tissue engineering. Using a gene-therapy strategy, Osx will specifically target the bone- marrow and/or local-tissue derived cells, and for the first time, the effects of Osx promoting cell differentiation and enhancing osteogenesis and dentinogenesis will be determined in a novel transgenic model. Results derived from these studies in live animals will help identify new sources of cells, which are the most important element and most powerful engine for tissue engineering. These investigations will also provide novel and important insights into bone and tooth tissue formation using a gene-therapy approach, which will certainly benefit the patients who have tissue defects, damages and injuries in mouth as well as craniofacial regions.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Suppression of pharmacoresistant seizures in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) remains a major challenge in epilepsy therapy. Adenosine is an endogenous neuromodulator with potent anticonvulsant properties and thus highly suited to meet this therapeutic need. However, due to peripheral side effects of adenosine, a local mode is needed to supplement adenosine to the brain. We aim to develop biocompatible scaffolds to deliver the endogenous seizure suppressor adenosine to suppress seizures in a rat model of MTLE. The rationale for this approach is based on the following findings from our labs: (1) Deficits of adenosinergic neuromodulation, in particular upregulation of the main adenosine removing enzyme adenosine kinase, contribute to epileptogenesis and seizures. (2) Augmentation of adenosine is sufficient to suppress pharmacoresistant seizures. (3) Local delivery of approx. 200 ng adenosine per day by brain implants of adenosine releasing cells is sufficient to provide complete seizure suppression in a model of MTLE. (4) Stem cell derived brain implants engineered to release adenosine retard epileptogenesis. (5) The combination of biopolymers and engineered stem cells promotes the release of adenosine. (6) Polymer scaffolds and cell encapsulation matrices are available, which permit cell replacement and sustained local drug delivery. Our CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS is that local brain implants based on a combination of slow degrading biopolymers with adenosine and/or cells engineered to release adenosine are needed for clinical applications aimed at suppressing seizures in pharmacoresistant MTLE. The model system to address this hypothesis will consist of a novel protein-based polymer system, silk fibroin, in combination with adenosine and adenosine-producing cells, to be tested in an animal model of epilepsy. Our SPECIFIC AIMS are: Aim 1. Engineer biocompatible polymers for the local therapeutic delivery of adenosine. Aim 2. Develop a polymer/cell based system for the sustained delivery of adenosine.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All human cells possess a cytoskeleton that is key to sustaining stresses and to generating forces as well as to transducing signals. The simplest cell, the Red Blood Cell, has a relatively basic membrane skeleton that is essential to withstanding the stresses of blood flow. The more complex marrow-derived Stem Cells, in comparison, possess a more typical cytoskeleton with a cortex and ""stress fibers"" that contribute to attachment as well as probing of the microenvironment in proliferation and differentiation. At least for RBCs, most if not all cytoskeletal proteins are known, and a large number of disease-causing mutants have been identified (involving both protein unfolding and perturbed interactions). Crystal structures are also rapidly emerging for many structural proteins, but cytoskeletal pliability within cells under stress is essentially unknown and likely underlies various pathophysiological processes including some folding diseases. In order to broadly identify cytoskeletal changes in conformation or assembled state directly within stressed cells, we have developed a proteomic-scale approach of in situ labeling of sterically-shielded cysteines with `cell-viable' fluorophores - the method allows multi-level analyses in exploiting fluorescence imaging, quantitative mass spectrometry, and staged multi-dye labeling. Our `Cys Shotgun' studies will significantly improve our molecular understanding in three representative marrow-derived cell systems. We will address in Aim 1 how blood flow stresses affect normal and diseased RBC cytoskeleton, and show with intact membranes that specific domains in spectrin unfold under fluid shear. Preliminary Results indeed show that shielded cysteines in the two isoforms of the cytoskeletal protein spectrin are increasingly labeled as a function of shear stress and time, indicative of forced unfolding of specific domains. We will use similar methods in Aim 2 to gain insight into protein conformation and assembly in the two main types of human marrow-derived Stem Cells, particularly focusing on how elastic matrices couple to an active cytoskeleton, affecting expansion & differentiation. Within mesenchymal stem cells, initial results show non-muscle myosin IIA, filamin-A, and vimentin are just a few of the cytoskeletal proteins that exhibit differential labeling in tensed versus relaxed cells. Since red cell membrane diseases and disordered erythropoiesis feature in a number of clinically relevant diseases our findings will likely have significant clinical relevance. These will be the first set of studies to identify protein domains that unfold or dissociate in stressed cells, suggesting specific sites to focus on for stabilization in case of disease. In addition, among the new therapeutic strategies that call for in situ structural insights are exon-skipping strategies that are being applied by others to spectrin superfamily proteins. Methods for identifying cytoskeletal sites of in situ unfolding and deformation should thus provide translational as well as basic insights. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: All human cells possess a cytoskeleton that is central to sustaining stresses and generating forces as well as mechano-transducing signals. Red blood cells have a relatively simple membrane skeleton that is key to withstanding the stresses of blood flow; and Stem cells have a more typical cytoskeleton with stress fibers that contribute to actively probing the microenvironment to direct cell lineage. A large number of disease- causing mutants have been identified and some involve protein unfolding. We seek to understand   directly within intact cells   protein folding/unfolding and association, and we have developed an in situ tagging approach for such purposes. We anticipate our studies will significantly improve our molecular understanding in three representative marrow-derived systems: we will address how stresses affect normal and diseased red cell cytoskeleton, and how elastic matrices couple to an active cytoskeleton to affect stem cell function. Since RBC membrane diseases and disordered erythropoiesis feature in a number of clinically relevant diseases our findings will likely have significant clinical relevance. New therapeutic strategies that could benefit more broadly include exon skipping strategies that are presently being applied to the spectrin family protein dystrophin [Goyenvalle Science 2006].

well described gastric cancer mouse model. In the first specific aim, we will characterize the cell withinthe'
adherent mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) population responsible for homing and engraftment using a
combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments. In the second specific aim, we will characterize a role for
CXCR-4/SDF1 interaction in mobilization of MSC, and test the stability of receptor expression. In the third
specific aim we will use a cre-lox based approach to determine what role fusion may play in these events.
These studies will employ a combination of in vitro studies on primary MSC cultures as well as in vivo bone
marrow transplantation models of lentiviral modified MSC populations and will lay the ground work for our
long term objectives of our laboratory, which is to define the role of BMDC in inflammation induced epithelial
cancers and to identify novel approaches to cancer prevention and treatment.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ionizing irradiation-induced pulmonary damage limits effective radiation dose escalation in the treatment of lung and esophageal cancer. The C57BL/6J mouse model of irradiation-induced late organizing alveolitis/fibrosis closely follows the parameters of human pulmonary irradiation damage. We have demonstrated that bone marrow origin macrophages migrate to the mouse lung at the time of up regulation of endothelial cell VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 at 120-140 days after pulmonary irradiation, followed by TGF2-mediated migration and proliferation of bone marrow origin myofibroblast progenitor cells (bone marrow stromal cells/mesenchymal stem cells), which contribute to pulmonary fibrosis. Both migrations are significantly reduced by intrapulmonary manganese superoxide dismutase-plasmid liposome (MnSOD-PL) gene therapy. We now propose to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) of initiation of the late pulmonary lesion and optimize its amelioration by MnSOD-PL. We will use female C57BL/6J mice and  HSV-TK (Herpes Simplex Virus-Thymidine Kinase)-CCSP+ transgenic mice (which have gancyclovir sensitive Clara Cell Secretory Protein positive lung stem cells) and are chimeric for male GFP+ bone marrow. The first specific aim tests the hypothesis that inhalation MnSOD-PL gene therapy facilitates lung irradiation through enhancement of migration of marrow origin reparative alveolar and bronchial stem cell progenitors. The second specific aim tests the hypothesis that periodic repeat MnSOD-PL inhalation gene therapy decreases late pulmonary fibrosis through decreased migration of marrow origin myofibroblasts. The third specific aim tests the hypothesis that adding inhalation of mitochondrially targeted catalase plasmid liposomes to MnSOD-PL will enhance lung radiation protection. Methods include nebulizer-inhalation of mt-catalase-PL, and MnSOD-PL in pulmonary irradiated chimeric mice, continuous BUDR labeling by mini-osmotic pump, cell sorting, and histopathology. These studies should define critical steps in irradiation pulmonary fibrosis and identify new targets for therapeutic intervention, thereby decreasing patient side effects and facilitating dose escalation in the initial treatment or retreatment of recurrent thoracic cancers.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of obesity is multifactorial and includes interactions between variant alleles and environments that predispose individuals toward development of the disease. Other components of obesity, based on variations in epigenetic programming, have been established by the strong evidence obtained from human epidemiological and animal studies that link nutritional status during in utero and early post-natal growth to the development of obesity and diabetes in adults. However, the mechanisms associated with these epigenetic contributions to obesity are difficult to study because of the lack of a good experimental model or appropriate gene targets. To investigate epigenetic contributions to obesity, we have developed an animal model based upon phenotypic variation of obesity in genetically identical mice. Using global gene expression analyses, we have identified a set of coordinately regulated developmental genes in adipose tissue that are associated with the development of a robust obesity phenotype in mice after feeding a high fat diet. These genes include an antagonist of Wnt signaling, secreted frizzled related protein 5 (Sfrp5) and the imprinted gene mesoderm specific transcript (Mest). Additionally, variations of Sfrp5 and Mest expression in adipose tissue biopsies performed on young mice prior to exposure to dietary fat can predict animals that were most susceptible to the development of dietary fat- induced obesity at a later age. In this proposal, we will use a retroviral-delivered inducible transgenic approach to examine the mechanism associated with the coordinated regulation of Sfrp5 and Mest and to determine how these genes modulate lipogenesis and adipocyte differentiation. We will also identify genomic targets associated with variable expression of Sfrp5 and Mest in adipose tissue to determine whether epigenetic differences are present within these elements. The results of these experiments will begin to elucidate unique biological mechanisms linked to epigenetic programming that are associated with variations of adiposity in the absence of genetic variation. Future experiments will evaluate these mechanisms and associated genes as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  Many studies have shown that nutritional status during development can permanently alter an individual's susceptibility to developing diseases such as obesity and diabetes, however, very little is known about the biological mechanisms that cause these changes. Therefore, we characterized a mouse model that has no genetic differences between individuals to study the basis for these permanent alterations, and have identified several genes that are associated with variations in obesity. We propose to study how two of these genes, mesoderm specific transcript and secreted frizzled related protein 5, function in order to determine whether they could be good therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have previously demonstrated the use of genetically modified mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing Akt (Akt-MSC) for therapeutic myocardial protection and repair. More recently, we have shown that conditioned media from these cells can protect cardiomyocytes from hypoxia induced apoptosis in vitro and the myocardium from ischemic damage in vivo. Based on our observation that the protective effect of the conditioned media can occur earlier than 72 hours, we postulated that the actions of Akt-MSC on ischemic myocardium are paracrine in nature and mediated by specific secreted proteins with cytoprotective properties. Further studies have shown that these cells dramatically upregulated (40X) secreted frizzled related protein (Sfrp 2). Sfrp 2 has been shown to bind and antagonize the effects of members of the Wnt family of proteins some of which modulate cell survival or apoptosis. Indeed, our preliminary data showed that Wnts can be upregulated in hypoxic cardiomyocytes in vitro and in the myocardium following infarction in vivo. Based on these results, we hypothesize that (i) Sfrp 2 is involved in paracrine anti-apoptotic effect of Akt-MSCs in vivo (ii) administration of Sfrp 2 protein or gene will confer therapeutic protection against infarct damage in vivo; (iii) the observed protective effect of Sfrp 2 is due to its interruption of the Wnt signaling pathway by interacting and sequestering specific Wnt(s) that have pro-apoptotic properties. To test these hypotheses, we will knockdown the expression of Sfrp 2 in Akt-MSC by siRNA followed by injection of the cells or the conditioned media from the cells into the infarcted mouse hearts. We will then determine in vivo therapeutic efficacy by intramyocardial injections of purified, recombinant Sfrp 2 for protection against ischemic damage in vivo. In addition we will evaluate the effects of overexpression of Sfrp 2 using AAV-mediated expression using regulated and cell specific promoters. Subsequently, we will examine the mechanism of the protection by determining if Sfrp 2 regulates the canonical or the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways by using in vitro and in vivo reporter assays. Finally we will find Wnts that have proapoptotic properties and determine the nature of interaction of Sfrp 2 with these proapoptotic Wnts. Our studies, if successful, will lead to discovery of novel pathways, mechanisms and may result in new modes of treatment for acute myocardial infarction.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The adult bone marrow non-hematopoietic stem cells known as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) promote functional cardiac recovery in animals with myocardial infarction (MI). In several countries these cells have been administered to patients with MI with reported beneficial effects. Despite the efficacy of MSC administration, most studies have shown that few of the cells engraft long-term and that only a portion of the surviving cells appear to differentiate to a mature cardiac phenotype. In animals injection of concentrated conditioned medium into cardiac muscle appears to have effects similar to those of direct injection of cells, implying that secreted factors from the cells comprise the principle basis for the benefits. Our preliminary data demonstrate that non-hematopoietic human bone marrow stem cells can exert cardiac protective and reparative effects when delivered intravenously (IV) to animals with MI. Furthermore, we show that serum-free medium conditioned by mixed MSCs or by standardized MSCs isolated by magnetic sorting for the p75 low affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75LNGFR; p75MSCs) can support the growth and survival of adult cardiac stem/progenitor cells through activation of the transcription factor STAT3. Because MSCs are prepared from a heterogeneous mixture of adherent cells, it is desirable to have a standardized isolation procedure for a population of progenitor cells that predictively imparts cardiac protection and/or repair. We have recently isolated sub-populations of non-hematopoietic stem cells from the total mononuclear cells of bone marrow by specific cell surface epitopes. They may be particularly well-suited for cardiac preservation based on their expression profiles of secreted proteins. Comparing the effectiveness of one of these sub-populations (p75MSCs) to mixed adherent MSCs, we will determine whether intravenous or intramuscular administration of non-autologous stem cells can be used to provide paracrine-based cardiac cell therapy. We will identify the factors secreted by the stem cells that are effective and determine whether the mechanism of action is sparing of existing cardiomyocytes by inhibition of apoptosis or necrosis or augmenting the proliferation and survival of endogenous cardiac stem cells.   
  
SPECIFIC AIMS   
  
1. To identify a cardioprotective sub-population of human bone marrow stem cells and determine the growth conditions and timing of administration necessary to rescue cardiac function after MI in immunodeficient mice.   
  
2. To determine the ability of strain-mismatched murine bone marrow stem cells delivered intravenously or intramuscularly to promote cardiac protection or recovery after MI in immunocompetent mice.   
  
3. To identify the specific factors secreted by the stem cells that preserve cardiac function.

often-lethal diseases are clearly inadequate. The generation of organs suitable for transplantation offers
tremendous potential to treat these types of diseases. The early development of over 20 mammalian organs
involves the sequential, ordered exchange of signals between interacting epithelial and mesenchymal cell
populations, resulting in their progressive differentiation. We hypothesize that this complex, dynamic
regulatory network can be resolved by the integration of different scientific disciplines and used to design
and build organ precursors or parts.
As a part of the larger SysCODE consortium we will develop technologies that can be used to engineer the
surrounding microenvironment. We propose to develop novel, three dimensional (3D) microscale constructs
to be used as tools to study populations of interacting mesenchymal and epithelial cells . These microscale
techniques will enable the biomimecry of the complex 3D structure of epithelial and mesenchymal cell
interactions that occur in the embryonic in vivo environment. In vivo, the cellular environment is tightly

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) occurs in over 100,000 patients each year. It cannot heal spontaneously. As neither surgical repair nor non-surgical treatments provide a reliably satisfactory clinical outcome, ACL ruptures remain a pressing orthopaedic problem. The research described in this proposal is directed towards improving the repair of the ACL through the application of novel biological approaches. These are based upon recent data suggesting that, contrary to the received view, the ruptured ACL mounts a healing response when a reinforced collagenous hydrogel is interposed between the severed ends of the ligament. Critical to this response is the migration of cells from the damaged ligament into the hydrogel. Preliminary data suggest that these are not representative of ACL cells as a whole, but constitute a distinct population which shares many of the properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). To achieve a clinically useful repair, these cells must divide, differentiate into ligament cells and lay down a matrix of sufficient mechanical strength. The experiments described in this proposal address these fundamental issues using in vitro and in vivo porcine models. In Specific Aim 1, the cells that migrate from the damaged ACL will be recovered from the hydrogel and investigated by biological and immunological criteria to determine to what degree they share the properties of MSCs. Their location within the ACL will be determined by immunohistochemistry. In Specific Aim 2, the responses of therse cells to a selected sub-set of growth factors will be determined. These factors are: FGF-2, BMP-12, BMP-13 and TGF-beta1. Both adenovirus- mediated gene transfer and, where possible, recombinant proteins will be evaluated in monolayer culture and in an in vitro ""gap"" model of ACL injury and repair. In Specific Aim 3, a full thickness, ACL rupture model in the pig will be used to determine the mechanical strength that is achievable when a gene-laden, reinforced hydrogel is used to repair a clinically-relevant defect. MRI, histology and immunohistochemistry will also be used to evaluate the healed ligament. These studies will advance our knowledge of the biology of the injured ACL and suggest novel, biologically-based approaches to healing.

Joint prostheses (e.g. hip and knee) have been very successful in restoring function to patients, however these devices generally last only 10-15 years. Implants used for filling bone defects or lesions are even less well-developed; the current ""gold standard"" for treatment is autologous bone graft, which carries many associated risks and limitations. Recently, many investigators have sought to improve implant performance by modifying biomaterials with molecules that mimic the endogenous bone environment, for example, peptides derived from components of the extracellular matrix. This ""biomimetics approach"" has shown much promise for enhancing the bioactivity of certain types of materials, however, surprisingly, the class of materials that is among the most osseoconductive, the calcium phosphates, has received the least amount of attention in this regard. To address this deficit in biomaterials research, the broad, long-term goal of this project is to determine whether mimetic proteins/peptides, such as collagen l-derived peptides and Bone Morphogenic Protein-2 (BMP-2), can enhance the osseointegration of calcium phosphate biomaterials, particularly hydroxyapatite (HA). To accomplish this goal, we have designed 4 specific aims: 
Specific Aim 1: To identify biomimetic peptides that stimulate optimal in vitro human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) attachment and differentiation. 
Specific Aim 2: To determine whether engineering peptides with additional domains enhances peptide tethering and/or bioactivity. More specifically, peptides will be modified by adding an HA-binding sequence, or by inserting a polylinker domain between the HA- and cell-binding motifs. 
Specific Aim 3: To test the efficacy of peptide coatings in promoting adhesion and differentiation of endogenous MSCs, leading to enhanced bone formation. A rat tibial implantation model will be used to test peptide efficacy in vivo. 
Specific Aim 4: To determine whether osseointegration can be improved by pre-loading scaffolds with MSCs. Public-health relatedness: The major goal of this study is to optimize the performance of calcium phosphate biomaterials that are commonly used for joint prosthetic and bone replacement applications.","237954",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of this proposal is to regenerate and repair dental pulp/dentin thereby reducing the need of endodontic procedures. Approximately 16 million teeth receive root canal treatment (~$14 billion) per year in the US-a procedure consisting of the removal of the entire pulp and replacing it with gutta percha (rubber-like material). There have been no other effective ways to repair the infected or injured pulp tissue besides complete amputation. Recent advances in pulp stem cell isolation and tissue engineering technologies have shed light on the possibility of pulp tissue regeneration. Removing the entire pulp poses two clinical problems: 1) further dental work such as crown and post that weaken the tooth are most often required; 2) devitalized immature teeth are weak with little dentin structure. Therefore the therapeutic capacity to regenerate pulp/dentin of the root would be clinically beneficial. Our preliminary data showed that human pulp-like structure constructed in vitro using stem cells and implanted in canals of human tooth fragments can be vascularized in the subcutaneous space of SCID mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that pulp-like tissue can be regenerated in tooth using stem cells aided with a scaffold system. In this proposal, we will characterize dental stem cells for regeneration of pulp/dentin and use mice and minipigs as ectopic and orthotopic animal study models respectively. There are three specific aims that stepwisely test the hypothesis to reach the goal: Aim 1- To characterize pulp stem cells of various sources for pulp regeneration. This aim will characterize prospective stem cells of various sources for pulp tissue regeneration. Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs), human stem cells from apical papilla (hSCAP) and stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) will be isolated and characterized by examining their stem cell properties and gene expression profiles relevant to osteo/odontogenic potency using in vitro and in vivo experimentation. Procedures include flow cytometry, real-time RT-PCR, Western blot, immunohistochemical analysis, etc. Aim 2- To determine angiogenesis of human pulp-like tissues in vivo in SCID mice. The extent of angiogenesis is critical to the success of pulp regeneration. Stem cells seeded in D,L-lactide and glycolide (PLG) scaffolds containing angiogenic growth factors will be inserted into root canal space of human tooth fragments and implanted subcutaneously into SCID mice. The implanted teeth will then be harvested for histological analysis of cellularity, matrix production, formation of odontoblast-like cells and particularly vascularity. Gene expression profile of the regenerated tissue will be analyzed with and immunohistochemistry. Aim 3- To test pulp regeneration in a relevant tissue environment in swine. This experimental swine model simulates actual clinical applications in humans using autologous stem cells for pulp regeneration in pulp space that has been infected and then disinfected. Pulp stem cells from swine teeth will be seeded in scaffolds in vitro and planted back to the disinfected pulpless root canal space for de novo pulp regeneration or planted into pulp chamber space for partial pulp regeneration. The vascularization and innervations of the regenerated tissue will be determined with histology and immunohistochemistry. The success of this project would represent a potential breakthrough in clinical endodontics using stem cell therapy and serve as an example for other organ regeneration.   
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  About 16 million teeth receive root canal treatment (~$14 billion) per year in the United States- a procedure that requires the removal of the entire dental pulp tissue which is then replaced with gutta percha (rubber-like material). This pulp tissue is important for the entire function and the health of the tooth, removing which renders the tooth weakened and susceptible to functional failures.  There have been no other effective ways to repair the infected or injured pulp/dentin tissue besides complete amputation. The purpose of this proposal is to utilize and further characterize the adult dental stem cells for the regeneration of pulp/dentin tissues. Using animal study models, a method will be established and tested in this proposal to regenerate dental pulps using adult dental stem cells. If successful, a subsequent human trial may be carried out in the future and its success will promise a reduced need of traditional aggressive root canal therapies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The increasing prevalence of overweight and obese women of childbearing age is a growing public health concern, which can result in harmful, persistent effects in offspring, including pre-disposition to obesity and diabetes. Mechanisms linking maternal obesity and over nutrition to obesity and diabetes of offspring remain poorly defined. Skeletal muscle is the main periphery tissue responsible for glucose and fatty acid utilization. Since there is no increase in muscle fiber number after birth, fetal stage is crucial for skeletal muscle development. Fetal muscle up to late gestation contains a large number of mesenchymal stem cells (pluripotent progenitor cells). The proliferation and lineage commitment of pluripotent cells directly affect the number and size of muscle fibers developed. The commitment of pluripotent cells to adipogenesis instead of myogenesis will increase the number of intramuscular adipocytes, an event associated with insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. In our preliminary studies, we observed that maternal obesity and over-nutrition down-regulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and insulin signaling, and promoted adipogenesis which should be associated with altered proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent progenitor cells. AMPK may play an important role in the control of proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent cells in fetal muscle in vivo. To confirm it, a good in vivo experimental model is needed. To establish an experimental model which can track the proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent cells in fetal muscle in vivo and to use this model to test the role of AMPK in fetal muscle development. Mesenchymal stem cells injected into fetal muscle will proliferate and differentiate into myogenic, adipogenic and other cells in fetal muscle. Mesenchymal stem cell C3H10T1/2 will be transfected with a pDsRed vector carrying AMPK constant active construct and a pAcGFP vector carrying dominant negative AMPK constructs respectively. pDsRed and pAcGFP vectors are mammalian expression vectors and express red and green fluorescent proteins respectively. Cells stably expressing red or green fluorescent proteins will be cloned and then injected into the skeletal muscle of fetuses. Pregnant sheep carrying these fetuses will be allowed to lamb which will then be euthanized for muscle collection. Muscle will be sectioned and the existence of fluorescent cells in muscle fibers, intramuscular adipocytes and connective tissues in skeletal muscle will be measured. The use of cells carrying two different fluorescent proteins will allow a direct comparison for the destination of cells with different AMPK activities. This model will be crucial for understanding the role of AMPK in the proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent cells in vivo. This model will also be useful for studying intracellular signaling pathways which affect differentiation of pluripotent cells in fetal muscle. Such studies will have enormous biomedical implications and will greatly facilitate studies regarding fetal developmental programming.

However, we have shown that Delta-24-RGD, a new, tumor-selective, infectivity-augmented, replicationcompetent
oncolytic virus developed by our group may be an effective treatment against gliomas. Delta-24-
RGD is unique, because its tumor selectivity is based on an alteration of the viral E1A gene, which renders
it more selective and potent than previous oncolytic adenoviruses, and because of the addition of an RGD
motif in the fiber knob, which increases its infectivity of tumor cells. Indeed, preclinical studies demonstrated
the capacity of Delta-24-RGD to eradicate human gliomas in animal models, and a Phase I clinical trial of
Delta-24-RGD in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas is scheduled to begin in January 2007. Here we
hypothesize that Delta-24-RGD will be efficacious in human gliomas, and this efficacy can be improved by
combining it with chemotherapeutic agents and by exploiting the tumor tropic properties of human bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to improve viral delivery. The Specific Aims to test our hypothesis
are: AIM 1. Determine the extent to which Delta-24-RGD can replicate in and spread through gliomas
in situ in patients. In order to assess viral infection, replication, and spread in situ, post-treatment glioma
specimens obtained by ""en bloc"" surgical procedures in patients enrolled in our Phase I clinical trial will be
examined to establish qualitative assessments of the pattern of Delta-24-RGD distribution in the tumor, and
quantitative assessments of the distance of spread from the initial point of injection will be made. AIM 2.
Determine the extent to which Delta-24-RGD and temozolomide are synergistic anti-glioma agents
and exam of the underlying mechanisms of the synergy. Preliminary data indicate that the combination
of Delta-24-RGD and temozolomide results in a significant anti-glioma effect. We hypothesize that this
increased efficacy is due to adenovirally-mediated inhibition of the DMA-repair pathways and the G2 arrest
involved in temozolomide resistance. Results of this Aim, including expression of DMA repair genes and cell
cycle modifications by oncolytic adenoviruses, will be compared with the data obtained from human patient
samples in Aim 1 to ascertain whether adenovirus infection would result in the generation of favorable
conditions for temozolomide sensitivity in vivo. AIM 3. Determine the extent to which bone marrowderived
human mesenchymal stem cells can improve the delivery of Delta-24-RGD to glioma.
Preliminary data demonstrate that hMSC localize to gliomas after systemic injection in vivo and that this
tropism for gliomas can be exploited to deliver therapeutic agents. To test this hypothesis, in vivo studies

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging, growth and development bring about progressive changes in the capacity to repair and regenerate. The greatest economic costs come at the end of life as increasingly fragile skin and immobility conspire with ischemia and a delayed healing response to generate chronic wounds. This proposal combines efforts to understand age-related aspects of the regenerative and healing responses in four specific aims. First, the relative importance of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) in wound healing will be tested by adoptive transfer of marrow and by local administration of MSCs exchanged between young and old mice. Mouse strains with different regenerative capacities will also be compared. The next three aims relate to the role of the Wnt signal pathway. The second aim extends from preliminary observations of the enhanced regeneration of wounds in mice that contain a conditional FSP-cre/R.-cateninAex3 allele for stabilized li-catenin, the major mediator of canonical Wnt signaling. This regenerative phenotype will be studied in different types of wound models, and we will determine if MSCs from conditional expressors of stabilized R-catenin differ in their capacity to promote healing and regeneration. We will compare the capacity of stabilized li-catenin, MRL/""super-healer"", and wild type mouse MSCs to modify the healing process by adding stem cells to the wound site. Aim three focuses on the role the Wnt pathway in MSC biology. We will determine if Wnt signaling is critical to the properties of the MRL.The fourth aim concentrates on the biological properties of FGF binding protein (FGF-BP). In impaired wounds, FGF-BP produces a remarkable expansion of granulation tissue, suggesting that availability of FGF is limited in chronic wound states such as ischemia. Since FGF-BP is reportely a direct target of IS-catenin, we will also examine FGF-BP expression in wounds of the MRL and stabilized li-catenin mouse. Normal and ischemic wounds from young and old rats will be compared for responses to FGF-BP supplementation by adenoviral gene transfer. The activity of FGF-BP will also be evaluated in vivo. These novel signal pathways may be able to convert the chronic wound into a normal wound as well as shift the equilibrium from repair to regeneration. Lay Summary: Tissue regeneration and repair progressively decline with age. We will study how stem cells that come from the bone marrow respond to signals that can improves the speed and quality of healing.

Dysregulation of these processes is associated with epithelial/mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key event in cancer initiation and progression.  Phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) is a key regulator of these processes.  Production of PI4,5P2 at discrete subcellular sites is mediated by the unique targeting of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases.  Type Igamma PIP Kinase (PIPKIgamma) is positioned to mediate focal adhesion assembly, endocytosis, and maintenance of cell-cell contacts by virtue of its specific targeting to these subcellular locations and its interaction with key components and regulation by key signaling pathways.  We propose to elucidate the role of PIPKI( in these processes, thus providing insight into EMT and cancer initiation and metastasis.  The proposed work will critically assess this hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the mechanism for PIPKIgamma targeting to cell-cell contacts via its interaction with E-cadherin and how this targeting influences EMT; (2) Investigate the role of PIPKI( in endocytosis via its interaction with the mu-subunits of the adaptor protein (AP) complexes and how this function relates to maintenance of cell-cell contacts; (3) Investigate signals that lead to Src phosphorylation of PIPKIgamma as a mechanism for regulation of E-cadherin and AP2 functions.  Collective understanding of PIPKIgamma's role in each of these processes will provide insight into the mechanism of EMT and subsequent cancer metastasis.  A role for PIPKIgamma in the assembly of E-cadherin cell-cell junctions, the internalization of cadherins, and signaling mechanisms that modulate EMT have many implications for cancer.  Cancers of epithelial cell origin represent approximarely 80% of all cancers, and of these the loss of surface expression of E-cadherin is a prognosticator of poor patient outcome.  An understanding of the underlying mechanism of E-cadherin internalization has the potential to impact our understanding of cancers of epithelial origin.","282819",

The objective of this K08 Award proposal is to enable the candidate to become an independent investigator in renal pathology and molecular biology in the field of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The candidate proposes a research plan under the multidisciplinary mentorship of Drs. Becker, Hullett (biochemistry), Oberley (pathology), Aiken (molecular biology) and Bakken (faculty development). The laboratory efforts will be supplemented with coursework in molecular biology, pathology and biochemistry designed to enhance the candidate's training as a physician-scientist. CKD is a worldwide public health problem with poor outcomes and high costs. Emerging evidence suggests that tubular epithelial-myofibroblast transdifferentiation (EMT) is an important event in renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, a common final pathway to various injuries to the kidney. EMT involves the transformation of tubular epithelial cells (TEC) into cells with mesenchymal morphology, formation of actin stress fibers, loss of cell adhesions and increased cell migration. Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) is a stress protein that exerts its cytoprotective effects by apoptosis inhibition, control of the redox status and modulation of actin filament dynamics. Despite its cytoprotective roles and interactions with actin filaments, HSP27 has not been studied in EMT. The aims of this proposal are (1) to study HSP27 mRNA and protein levels and localization during EMT (2) to dissect the the signaling events that lead to HSP27 activation (3) to investigate whether overexpression of HSP27 delays/arrests EMT. We have successfully reproduced EMT in NRK52E cells (rat proximal TEC cell line) after six days of treatment with TGF-(1. Following the extraction of mRNA and protein from cultured cells, HSP27 mRNA and protein levels will be studied at various time-points by real-time PCR, immunoblot (IB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques, together with markers of EMT (m-smooth muscle actin and ecadherin). HSP27 cellular localization will be analyzed by fluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy (EM). HSP27-actin interactions and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway will be assessed by IB, IHC and and EM using phalloidin and total/phosphospecific antibodies, with inhibitors of the MAPK pathway. Overexpression of HSP27 will be obtained by recombinant virus-mediated HSP27 gene transfer. This proposal would allow us to determine whether HSP27 overexpression can prevent/delay EMT.","117827",

events and cell aging. HIRA forms a complex with ASFla to mediate transcriptional activation and
formation of senescent heterochromatin, a process associated with tissue aging. Dr. Adams (Project 4) has
also characterized new and related UBN proteins that interact with HIRA. These observations lead to the
testable hypothesis that HIRA coordinates interactions with both ASFla and UBN proteins for chromatin
regulation in senescence and gene activation. In preliminary studies, we have collaborated with Dr. 'Adams to
characterize the structure and biochemistry of an ASFla/HIRA complex. The yeast Sir2 protein, and its
orthologs in higher eukaryotes, are NAD+ dependent histone deacetylases. Yeast Sir2 promotes gene
silencing and lifespan extension and its SIRT1 human ortholog has been implicated to counteract ageassociated
diseases such as type-II diabetes, obesity and neurodegenerative disorders in mammals. In
preliminary studies, we have determined crystal structures of the yeast Sir2 protein, Hst2, in various liganded

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this application is to investigate the role of bone marrow-derived stem cells in the development and progression of gastric cancer. Epithelial cancers are believed to originate from transformation of a tissue stem cell, but a second possible source of cancer stem cells is the bone marrow derived cell (BMDC). Epithelial cancers often arise in the setting of tissue loss and inflammation, and are preceded by hyperproliferation and metaplasia. Our group utilized has developed the Helicobacter mouse model of gastric cancer to address the origins of epithelial cancers. These studies from our laboratory suggest that chronic infection of C57BL/6 mice with Helicobacter, a known carcinogen, leads to chronic inflammation and repopulation of the stomach with BMDCs that then progress to metaplasia, dysplasia to intraepithelial cancer [Science 2004; 306:1568-1571]. These findings from our laboratory suggest that epithelial cancers may originate from marrow-derived sources and have broad implications for the multistep model of cancer progression. We propose to use this model system to investigate further the biology of bone marrow-derived stem cells in cancer. Our aims in this proposal will address the following questions: (1) What is the origin of the cancer stem cells and is there any correlation with number of circulating cells? (2) Are bone marrow stem cells inherently more susceptible to malignant progression than tissue stem cells, and can they differentiate into mature gastric cells? (3) Do IL-1 beta and other cytokines activate the immune system to result in cancer initiation? (4) Is bacterial overgrowth, a consequence of achlorhydria, necessary for progression of BMDCs to dysplasia and gastric cancer? (5) Do inherited (e.g. p53) genetic mutations in the bone marrow stem cell population lead to cancer irreversibility in the setting of histologic dysplasia? These collaborative studies between investigators at Columbia University and MIT will provide new insights into mechanisms of cancer initiation and progression.

It is mainly characterized by low bone mineral
density (BMD). Women have much lower BMD than men. Some BMD genes/genomic regions are sex-specific.
Menopause is associated with rapid bone loss.
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) and peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs), are precursors for
osteoblasts (bone formation cells) and osteoclasts (bone resorption cells), respectively.
The GOAL of this project is to identify genes that are differentially expressed (at mRNA levels) in BMMSCs and
PBMs in females with low vs. high BMD and with menopausal status changes. Such genes are expected to be
important for variation of female BMD and women health in general.
Our preliminary functional genomic studies of PBMs suggested HDC and RUNX1 (NOT the extensively studied
RUNX2) genes to be important in determining BMD in humans.
Project 2 is built upon this stimulating lead to screen much larger and more powerful samples of both BMMSCs and
3BMs to confirm and extend our preliminary studies and to comprehensively screen genes potentially important for
BMD. This project has two inherently related aspects or stages; research in Stage 2 is for exemplifying functional
studies to follow the completion of research in Stage 1 and in Projects 1 and 3.
STAGE1 (Primary): Whole genome gene differential expression (WGGDE) study.
Hypothesis: Changes in the mRNA expression profiles in female BMMSCs and PBMs underlie mechanisms of
female BMD variation and are associated with menopause.
Specific Goals: To identify genes differentially expressed in BMMSCs and PBMs in women: 1) with high vs. low
BMD; 2) before and after menopause, and thus identify genes associated with female BMD and menopause.
We will recruit 80 otherwise healthy females and 80 age-matched otherwise healthy males aged 50-55, stratified
by discordant BMD values and menopausal status (for females). We will perform bone marrow aspiration and obtain
peripheral blood samples. BMMSCs and PBMs will be isolated and total RNA extracted. Microarray profiling
experiments and analyses will be performed on females for >40,000 known human genes and ESTs. Differentially
expressed genes will be verified by real-time RT-PCR with female samples. These verified genes in females will
be examined by real-time RT-PCR with male samples to examine their sex-specificity.
STAGE2 (Secondary): Functional studies of molecular mechanisms of candidate genes. As an exploratory
example, we will present and perform in-depth functional studies to dissect the mechanisms through which HDC and
RUNX1 genes regulate BMD. We hypothesize that HDC and RUNX1 genes are important for osteoclast
differentiation and/or bone resorption and HDC is a mediator for RLJNX1 gene in regulating BMD.
The results, together with those from Projects 1 and Project 3, will powerfully and efficiently identify genes and
some of their functions for female osteoporosis.
Identifying genes for human BMD variation, especially for women, is important for 1) gaining insights into the
fundamental molecular mechanisms of risk to osteoporosis, 2) discovering new pathways and targets for therapeutic
cures; 3) identifying genetically susceptible individuals (by designing diagnostic DMA chip), so that future preventions
and interventions can be targeted to and based on individuals' specific genotypes."," ",

Despite knowing the importance of the role of the microenvironment in tumor development, genetic studies of solid tumors, whether sporadic or hereditary, to date, have treated them as single amorphous entities. Genetic analyses of adenocarcinomas of the breast are no exception. We have preliminary loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and somatic TP53/PTEN mutation data in sporadic human breast cancer, which demonstrates that genetic alterations can differentially occur in the neoplastic epithelial compartment as well as the surrounding stromal compartment. We hypothesize that the tumor microenvironment, especially the stromal compartments, play an essential, albeit largely undefined role, in breast carcinogenesis, whether in the sporadic setting or in the hereditary setting. 
This application will use a genetic approach to address the hypothesis that LOH in the stromal and epithelial compartments of breast adenocarcinomas differentially contribute to tumor growth, such that they affect clinical outcomes differently. Thus, this project will take several genetic approaches to study the role of the tumor microenvironment in breast cancer development. First, genetic alterations in the epithelial and stromal cellular compartments of 225 human breast tumor samples will be assessed by genome-wide LOH as well as PTEN and TP53 mutation analyses on template cells obtained by laser-capture microdissection (LCM).
Further, these somatic genetic alterations in the epithelial and stromal components of this same large series of breast cancers will be correlated with clinical outcomes. Second, a murine model will be developed to examine the issue of epithelial-stromal interaction in mammary carcinogenesis, specifically, targeted disruption of Pten, which is known to participate in inherited and sporadic human breast carcinogenesis. 
Targeted disruption of Pten, using cre-loxP technology, will be performed separately in the epithelium and in the stroma and the consequences of each analyzed. In the future, examination of genetic alterations in the mammary neoplastic stroma and epithelium downstream of each of the mouse models developed in the Program Project is envisioned. Thus, the goals of the proposed project are to elucidate, at the clinical and molecular level, the relevant mesenchymal (stromal)-epithelial interactions, which impact on the control of the cell cycle, apoptosis and invasiveness of tumor cells. These might have future implications for clinical targeting for therapy or prevention."," ",

disabling, costly, and poorly understood. Bone heals through formation of new bone rather than scar tissue;
thus, similarities between fetal skeletal development and adult repair can be used to understand fracture
healing. In both development and healing, bone forms through two mechanisms, the direct formation of
bone (intramembranous ossification) and the formation of bone through a cartilage intermediate
(endochondral ossification). The primary mode of healing is determined during the earliest stages of repair
(inflammatory stage), as mesenchymal cells at the site of injury differentiate into osteoblasts or chondrocytes
based on conditions present at the fracture site.
 One major determinant of progenitor cell differentiation is mechanical stability. Stabilized fractures heal
predominantly by recapitulating embryonic intramembranous ossification while non-stabilized fractures
heal by reinitiating endochondral ossification. Preliminary work suggests that the early events that stimulate
repair, such as inflammation and angiogenesis, differ significantly in the stabilized and non-stabilized
fracture environments. We hypothesize that these differences produce distinct conditions that govern
mesenchymal cell differentiation into osteoblasts or chondrocytes. The aims of this proposal are: i) to
determine the post-injury inflammatory and angiogenic responses between stabilized and non-stabilized
fracture healing; 2) to identify the extent to which inflammation and angiogenesis regulate skeletal repair;
and 3) to establish the relation between inflammation and angiogenesis to the differentiation of progenitor
cells during fracture repair. We will use cellular, molecular, and genetic approaches to achieve these aims.
 This proposal will examine the role of the inflammatory response and vascular repair during bone
healing. Bydefining these processes, we will better understand the way fractures heal and the mechanism by
which cells decide to become bone or cartilage. Our goal is to use the findings from these studies to develop
new treatments to stimulate fracture healing.","317162",

p63, a p53 homologue, is transcribed into six isoforms derived from differential
promoter usage and alternative splicing. The transactivation (TA) isoforms, which resemble p53, are generated by the use of an upstream promoter and consist of an acidic N-terminal transactivation domain, a central DNA binding domain and a C-terminal oligomerization domain. The ¿N isoforms, produced from an intronic promoter, are capable of forming protein complexes with p53 family proteins to inhibit the function of TAp63 and p53 family members by sequestering or competing for target promoters it. Furthermore, the TAp63 and ¿Np63 isoforms undergo alternative splicing yielding different C-termianl tails. Unlike p53, which is dispensable for normal development, p63 is critical for the development of stratified epithelial tissues, such as epidermis, breast and prostate. p63 -/- mice completely lack stratified squamous epithelial and their derivatives, including epidermal appendages and mammary lacrimal, and salivary glands. Due to the lack of an epidermal barrier, these mice dehydrate and die shortly after birth. In addition, p63 -/- mice have major defects in limb and craniofacial development. Limb truncation in p63-/- mice are due to failure to maintain or differentiate the apical ectodermal ridge, a structure required for limb extension and dependent on coordinated epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Several autosomal dominant inherited human syndromes have have been mapped to the p63 gene. These syndromes have various combinations of limb malformations fitting the split hand-split foot spectrum, orofacial clefting, and extodermal dusplasia. p63 may also play a role in tumorigenesis. To explore these roles, we have generated GST-fusion constructs using pGEX-2TK vector through PCRbased cloning approach.  We transformed these plasmids into BL21 E.Coli strain, induced by IPTG and examined the expression levels of these fusion proteins. We are purifying the GST-p63 fusion proteins using a GST-pull down approach. The purified GST-p63 fusion proteins are being used to pull down proteins from lysates of HeLa cells. Proteins are separated on SDS-PAGE and stained . Individual protein bands are being subjected to mass spectrometry analysis."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This research will be done primarily in Brazil at University Sao Paolo, in collaboration with Silvio and Monica Duailibi, as an extension of NIH grant # R01 DE016132-01. Our long-term goal is to define cell populations and methods that can be used for autologous tooth tissue engineering in humans. The ability to identify and manipulate adult tooth progenitor cells, or dental stem cells (DSCs), would significantly facilitate this process. We have previously demonstrated, in published reports, the successful use of both pig and rat tooth bud cells to generate bioengineered dental tissues. These results demonstrate our ability to isolate and maintain in culture, both epithelial and mesenchymal post-natal DSCs, and to use these cells to bioengineer small, accurately formed tooth crowns containing dentin, enamel, pulp, cementum, and periodontal ligament tissues. Based on these promising results, we hypothesize that human tooth bud cells can be used to generate bioengineered dental tissues. Here we propose studies whose successful completion will define methods to bioengineer human dental tissues. Specifically, we will: 1) Optimize harvesting/culturing conditions for human post-natal tooth bud cells; 2) Perform molecular/cellular characterization of human post-natal dental stem cells; and 3) Generate and characterize bioengineered human tooth tissues. The successful completion of the proposed aims will significantly improve our knowledge and understanding of human postnatal DSCs and their potential utility in tooth tissue engineering, and will provide the foundation for eventual autologous tooth tissue engineering in humans.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A functional musculoskeletal system depends upon the transmission of force from muscle to bone, thus requiring the coordinated development of muscle, cartilage and tendon. Little however, is known about the cellular and molecular aspects of tendon formation. Progress unraveling the signals that direct mesenchymal cells to become tenocytes is of particular importance in elucidation of the early events that shape the organization and coordinated growth of the musculoskeletal system. Moreover, a tendon inducing activity may be of considerable clinical importance both for improvements in the treatment of tendon injuries and in bioengineering efforts to induce tendon formation from stem cells. The recent finding that Scleraxis (Scx) a bHLH transcription factor is a unique marker of tenocytes and tendon progenitors facilitated studies of tendon development and a number of subsequent studies have implicated FGF signaling in the induction of tendon progenitors. Dramatic results in our laboratory now demonstrate an even more profound role for TGF( signaling in tendon induction and differentiation. Embryos doubly mutant for the TGF(2 and TGF(3 genes develop limbs in which no tendons can be detected. Moreover, TGF( signaling acts as a potent inducer of Scx, in organ culture and in tissue culture experiments, significantly exceeding the extent and intensity of Scx induction by FGF signaling in similar experiments. We propose to explore TGF( role in tendon formation in three separate groups of experiments. The first aim will address the hypothesis that all tendon tissues depend on TGF( signaling. The phenotype in axial and cranial tendons will be evaluated in TGF(2 & 3 mutants and in mutants for a TGF( receptor (TGF(RII), in which all TGF( signaling is eliminated. We will further study the onset of the tendon phenotype in these mutants to establish the stage in which TGF( signaling is essential for tendon formation. The second aim will be to address the hypothesis that TGF( signaling is essential for later aspects of tendon formation as well. Inducible elimination of TGF(RII will enable exploration of later roles for TGF( signaling and establish if tendons are generated from a committed pool of early progenitors or through continuous recruitment of tendon cells by TGF( signaling to support tendon growth. Finally, the mechanism of Scx induction by TGF( signaling will be explored in tissue culture and in vivo; the activities of TGF( and FGF signaling will be compared and the possibilities of synergism or interdependence between these two signaling cascades will be explored using a combination of specific antagonists and mutant tissues. In addition, TGF( will be applied in utero using a retroviral system to evaluate the capacity of the cells induced by TGF( signaling to go beyond expression of Scx and cause the formation of ectopic or expanded tendons.

macromolecule hyaluronan (HA) in vertebrate limb morphogenesis. HA is a huge linear glycosaminoglycan which occupies an extensive molecular domain and has a pronounced hydration capacity. HA promotes the migration and proliferation of cells in a variety of model systems, and the binding of HA to its cell surface receptors including CD44 can also activate intracellular signaling. HA has recently been implicated as a costimulator of the EGFR/ErbB signaling network, which is a signaling pathway involved limb morphogenesis and patterning. The distal subapical mesenchymal cells of the developing limb bud, which are undergoing
proliferation and patterning in response to the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and other signaling centers, produce high amounts of HA which forms an expansive hydrated extracellular matrix between the cells. Thus, the cell and tissue interactions controlling the outgrowth and patterning of the limb occur in an environment rich in extracellular and pericellular HA. Based on its role in stimulating proliferation, migration, and intracellular signaling in many other systems, the hypothesis that HA facilitates the proliferation and directed migration of the subapical mesenchymal cells in response to the AER will be investigated, as will the hypothesis that HA modulates one or more of the signaling pathways particularly the EGFR/ErbB signaling network that regulates limb patterning events in the subapical mesoderm. As the mesenchymal cells in the central core of the limb bud become located outside of the range of AER signaling,
HA production declines to low levels and extracellular HA is removed. The hypothesis that this
downregulation of HA synthesis and removal of extracellular HA is necessary for the cells to form the precartilage condensations that trigger chondrogenic differentiation will be investigated. HA is also synthesized in relatively high amounts by the AER. The hypothesis that HA secreted by the AER may play an important role in facilitating the AER-subridge mesoderm interactions that result in directed limb outgrowth will be investigated.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Early cardiac cushions are located in the atrioventricular canal (AV) of the embryonic heart. These cushions are populated with mesenchymal cells and are the primordia for the cardiac valves and membranous septa. A great deal of progress has been made in identification of genes that regulate the initial steps of cushion brmation (stage14-22) (Gitleretal., 2003; Moorman and Christoffels, 2004). However, little is known about how these cushions differentiate into valve leaflets (stage 35-45). As valvular defects are among the most common and deleterious of all cardiac malformations, it is critical that the mechanisms of late valve development be delineated as well. Researchers studying early valve development have benefited from an excellent in vitro model of the initial stages of cushion formation. Until recently, such a model for late stage valve development has not existed. The proposed research uses an in vitro model we have developed to study late valve leaflet formation. This new model is composed of a collagen tube scaffold in which cushion anlage matures into valve tissue (Goodwin et al, 2005). This new model expands upon the previous cardiac cushion model (Runyan and Markwald, 1983) by providing a three-dimensional (3-D) environment in which cardiac cushion tissues recapitulate the later stages of valve development, both at the molecular and morphological levels. Initial experiments testing this model indicate that valve leaflet morphogenesis and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein expression/deposition is dependent on fluid flow in the tube model. The central hypothesis being tested in this proposal is that fluid flow plays a key role in valve leaflet morphogenesis. The tubular model system has the unique ability to test the role that fluid flow plays in valve morphogenesis. To address the hypothesis of this application, we will pursue three specific aims:Aim 1) Determine the effect of fluid flow on the differentiation and morphogenesis of valve leaflets. Aim 2) Determine the effect of fasciclin missexpression in flow-regulated valve cultures. Aim 3) Determine the role that proepicardial (PE) cells have on AV cushion maturation. This proposal is designed to provide specific data that describe the flow conditions that sustain the early stages of valve leaflet formation. This information would be valuable for the design of tissue-engineered valves as well as to provide new strategies for the treatment of birth defects.

The long term objective of this project is to explore the potential of the Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (SHP2) as a therapeutic target for the treatment of breast and other cancers characterized by overexpression of EGFR and HER2, while the current objective is to increase our understanding of SHP2 in EGFR/HER2 and ¿-catenin signaling. Therefore, the central hypothesis is that SHP2-mediated synergy between the EGFR/HER2 the ¿-catenin signaling pathways plays a major role in breast cancer development. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims have been proposed: 1) study the molecular mechanism of SHP2 in transducing HER2 signaling and transformation and 2) investigate how SHP2 mediates ¿-catenin activation downstream of EGFR and HER2 and examine how this event translates into tumor development and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). To address these questions, we will employ site-directed mutagenesis of SHP2 target phosphorylation sites, expression in normal or cancerous breast cells and analysis of effect on signaling, cell transformation and in vivo tumor development. We will also use Si-RNA-mediated knockout of a-catenin to corroborate mutant expression studies; we have already developed the Si-RNA knockout system for SHP2. The relevance of this proposal is that it addresses unanswered questions in breast cancer with the potential to provide a new drug target. "," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to better understand skin regeneration following wounding in adults. We discovered that after a full thickness wound on the back skin of an adult mouse, hair follicles form de novo. These new follicles reestablish their stem cell niche, produce hair, and cycle. This regeneration resembles embryonic hair follicle development morphologically and molecularly, and occurs several days after wound closure and reepithelialization. Inhibition of wnt prevents hair follicle neogenesis, while wnt overexpression enhances hair follicle formation. The major goal of this grant is to further characterize hair follicle neogenesis and understand the molecular signals controlling this phenomenon. We hypothesize that adult mammals, including humans, have the capacity to regenerate epidermal adnexal structures, such as hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and that this regeneration can be enhanced or inhibited by manipulating pathways known to be important for hair follicle development. Our aims are to study the effects of aging, hair cycle, minimum stimulus required for neogenesis, and whether neogenesis occurs in human skin grafted to immunodeficint mice. We will also define the role of adult stem cell populations in the skin for their ability to contribute to hair follicle neogenesis. Lastly, we will examine the role of growth factors known to be necessary for hair follicle development in follilce neogenesis. We will use global gene expression patterns to assist with our analysis and effort to discern the molecular pathways necessary for neogenesis so that we can eventually manipulate these pathways to improve wound healing. We will use transgenic and knockout mouse technology to evaluate the function of candiadate genes necessary for hair follicle regeneration. Our results should have major implications for understanding skin biology and developing future treatments for wounds, alopecia and other degenerative skin disorders.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The hair follicle is a mini-organ that is regenerated from stem cells in the adult. Significant progress has been made in defining and studying the stem cells of the follicular epithelium that regenerate the follicle. However their activation and the differentiation of their progeny to regenerate hair follicles is guided by a specialized mesenchymal population, the dermal papilla (DP). While the importance of these DP cells in follicle formation is clearly established, the nature of the signals generated by them and the ways in which they may change to guide keratinocytes through the successive tasks required to rebuild a follicle and elaborate a hair shaft remain poorly understood. This is in part because the techniques to purify DP cells and manipulate gene expression in them have lagged behind those used to study the epithelial components of the follicle. We have developed novel approaches that allow the purification in bulk of both DP cells and their immediate precursors in development. We have also developed assays to evaluate the inductive activity of these cells during follicle neogenesis. Finally we have developed methods to manipulate gene expression specifically in dermal papilla cells in the context of intact follicles. We will employ these novel reagents and techniques to identify the changes in gene expression that characterize the dermal papilla at different stages in follicle formation, regeneration, and degeneration. The function of these genes in follicle formation and cycling will be tested both in vivo and in vitro. The results of this work will have direct implications for the management of hair growth, regeneration and loss, and also for the management of severe skin wounds where the ability to regenerate cutaneous appendages remains an elusive goal. They will also have broader impact in the fields of stem cell biology and tissue engineering, not only because the hair follicle serves as an important model system in these fields, but because DP are a source of SKPs, an adult derived progenitor population that holds therapeutic promise.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
The pulmonary hypoplasia associated with developmental diaphragmatic defects causes a high degree of mortality and morbidity.  The pathogenesis and developmental relationship between diaphragmatic defects and pulmonary hypoplasia is poorly understood.  In a mutagenesis screen of late gestation embryos, we identified a mouse line with abnormal diaphragmatic muscularization and pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to a mutation in Fog2.  Lungs from Fog2 null mice are hypoplastic with agenesis of the accessory lobe.  We found a de novo FOG2 heterozygote nonsense mutation in a baby who died on the first day of life with severe pulmonary hypoplasia and a diaphragmatic defect.  As this work demonstrates that FOG2 is the first known cause of diaphragmatic defect and pulmonary hypoplasia in the human, understanding the mechanisms by which Fog2 contributes to normal diaphragmatic and lung development will provide valuable insight into the pathogenesis of these congenital defects.  In Aim 1, the role of Fog2 in muscle migration to the diaphragm will be studied.  In Aim 2, the mechanism by which lack of Fog2 results in accessory lobe agenesis will be explored through temporal-spatial analysis of branching genes in early embryonic lung explants of Fog2 null mice. In Aim 3, the human genes, FOG2 and GATA 4/5/6 will be sequenced in patients with congenital diaphragmatic defects and pulmonary hypoplasia.  The candidate is a pediatric intensivist with an interest in the pathogenesis of diaphragmatic and pulmonary lesions related to congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH).  She has had a long standing interest in becoming a physician scientist and seeks a formal, mentored training program to develop the skills necessary to become a successful independent investigator.  Her proposed training program includes mentorship and collaborations with successful leaders in the field of genetics, pulmonary biology, and congenital diaphragmatic hernia. She is a well supported candidate who will benefit highly from a Clinical Scientist Development Award.

The Program Project Grant (PPG), ""Cellular Decisions of Differentiation in the Gl Tract"" integrates the efforts of three investigators (one basic science and two clinical) from three Departments at the University of Michigan Medical School. The central goals of the proposed studies are: (a) To understand how gastric epithelial cells develop and maintain their identity by expressing or responding to the peptide morphogen sonic hedgehog (Shh) (b) To investigate how the patterns of cellular differentiation in the acid-secreting epithelium of the stomach changes in response to pathological insults, e.g., inflammation (such insults can alter the identity of the gastric epithelium, such that it acquires a small intestinal phenotype). Subproject 1 entitled ""Biology of a Sub-population of Gastric Progenitor Cells"" will examine the time course of gastric progenitor (stem) cell development in the embryo and their response to Shh or the proinflammatory cytokine interferon gamma. Subproject #2 entitled, ""Hedgehog signaling in stomach homeostasis and pathology,"" will use LacZ reporter mice to identify and characterize the gastric cell populations that express and respond to hedgehog signals. In addition, how hedgehog signals mediate the epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk will be analyzed. Subproject #3 entitled ""Role of Parietal Cell Hedgehog is normal and Inflamed Stomach,"" will focus on how biologically active Shh is generated from the parietal cell and mediates corpus-antral crosstalk. All projects focus on dissecting developmental pathways in the stomach and make extensive use of mouse models to interrogate important signaling pathways primarily related to Shh. Two Cores will assist the PPG investigators-the Cell Biology (Core A) and the Administrative (Core B). The Cell Biology Core will facilitate the analysis of the mouse models using state-of-the-art imaging and bioinformatics techniques. The Administrative Core will enhance the already strong interaction between these three investigators across department lines by organizing monthly joint meetings and co-sponsoring invited speakers. This will further our understanding of how gastric cells make decisions of identity and differentiation and provide clues on how their phenotype is altered by inflammatory signals as relevant to public health.

Our overall hypothesis is that bombesin-like peptide (BLP) is an early mediator of lung injury in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).  Increased numbers of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) containing BLP occur in human infants with BPD.  Pulmonary BLP and BLP receptor mRNA levels normally peak during the canalicular period, declining to low levels during alveolarization.  Excessive BLP in preterm infants could potentiate BPD, mediating peribrochiolar and interstitial fibrosis, reactive airways disease, and inhibiting alveolarization.  We observe increased urine BLP levels approximately 48-72h after birth in 2 distinct baboon models of BPD, with BLP levels correlating with severity of subsequent chronic lung disease.  Postnatal treatment with anti-BLP monoclonal antibody 2A11 protects against BPD in both models.  We will address our overall hypothesis using three Aims: AIM 1: To determine the pharmacological mechanisms and clinical usefulness of 2A11 for preventing acute and chronic lung disease in preterm baboons in vivo.  Hypothesis number 1: 2A11 functions by blocking pro-inflammatory effects of BLP during early BPD.  We will also evaluate a BLP receptor antagonist.  AIM 2: To analyze cellular and pharmacological mechanisms of BLP and 2A11 effects using simplified in vitro alveolarization systems.  Hypotheses number 2: (a) Abnormally elevated BLP during the early saccular period inhibits alveolarization.  (b) Key target cells for BLP during this process are mesenchymal cells, which alter production of mediators to become anti-angiogenic.  We will characterize fibroblast-derived mRNAs included by BLP that are able to modulate alveolarization.  AIM 3: To explore the role of BLP and/or PNECs as mediators of other BPD-associated changes, in collaboration with other U10 investigators.  Hypothesis number 3: BLP is induced by oxidant injury and acts as proximal cytokine, promoting acute and chronic inflammation with interstitial fibrosis.  Effective anti-oxidant therapy should decrease BLP secretion, leading to improved clinical outcomes.  Combined modality treatment with anti-oxidants together with 2A11 will be considered as resources permit.  These approaches will be instrumental in clarifying the underlying pathophysiology of BPD.  The proposed investigations will facilitate rational improvement in therapeutics based on comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The tree-like architecture of the mammary gland is generated by branching morphogenesis, a reiterative process of branch site initiation and tubule invasion from a pre-existing epithelial structure. Branching is controlled by the interplay between positive and negative regulators, defects in either of which can give rise to aberrancies ranging from hyperplasia to malignant growth. Our long term goal is to delineate how these positive and negative signals are integrated spatially within the tissue to determine which cells branch, and thereby define the branching pattern. We have developed a lithography-based three-dimensional organotypic culture model that recapitulates the architecture of mammary epithelial ducts, enables micrometer-resolution control of tissue geometry and microenvironment, and provides quantitative data in a physiologically relevant context. The engineered ducts execute a complete series of morphogenetic events that can be predicted computationally. Using this culture model, we have shown that the position of branching is determined in part by the concentration profile of transforming growth factor (TGF)-21, an autocrine inhibitory morphogen. Furthermore, we have found that cells located in positions that branch up- regulate the expression of mesenchymal markers during morphogenesis. Based on these preliminary and published data, we propose: 1- To investigate the features of the TGF21 concentration profile perceived and transduced by mammary epithelial ducts. 2- To determine the mesenchymal markers differentially expressed during morphogenesis, and whether these are necessary and/or sufficient to define position of branching. We will further test whether the pattern of mesenchymal gene expression is regulated by the TGF21 inhibitory profile. 3- To begin to dissect how branching is regulated by the physical properties of the microenvironment, by determining whether the extracellular matrix alters branching pattern, TGF21 inhibitory concentration profile, or neo-expression of mesenchymal markers. These studies will provide insight into the local cues and gene expression changes that govern position of branching.  
  
PROJECT RELEVANCE: Cells integrate information from stimulatory and inhibitory signals during branching morphogenesis to develop into the tree-like structure of the mammary gland; disruption or misregulation of these signals can lead to neoplastic growths and eventual development of frank tumors. Here we present studies aimed at understanding how mammary epithelial cells perceive inhibitory signals and translate them into patterned differences in gene expression during branching morphogenesis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During the period of the past award, we have developed a transgenic mouse that targets Cre-recombinase to the epicardium. This is a unique model system that we have used to demonstrate that conditional mutation of the retinoid receptor alpha (RXR1) in the epicardium affects cardiac morphogenesis and impairs embryonic survival. This mutation also uncovered a novel role of nuclear receptors in coronary arteriogenesis. We have subsequently determined that the 2-catenin gene acts downstream of the RXR1 pathway and we have generated data demonstrating that mutation of 2-catenin in the epicardium impairs cardiac morphogenesis by reducing cardiac cell proliferation and coronary vessel formation. Here we hypothesize that a Wnt/2 catenin pathway in the epicardium regulates key steps in cardiac development, including cell proliferation in the myocardium and the formation of the coronary vasculature. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we propose three independent genetic approaches that address the following specific aims: Aim 1 will determine the role of epicardial 2-catenin in cell fate specification and maturation of epicardial derivatives ex vivo and in vivo using time-lapse analysis of explanted tissues, lineage tracing, and mechanistic studies in epicardial-2-catenin mutant mice. In Aim 2 we will determine whether Wnt activity regulates the formation of the coronary arteries and the expansion of the compact zone. To address this question, we will use a genetic strategy to block 2-catenin nuclear translocation and analyze signaling downstream of Wnt in the epicardium.. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine whether 2 catenin is a functional mediator of RXR1 signaling. As a proof of principle for this hypothesis, we propose the rescue of the RXR1 phenotype by interbreeding the RXR1 mutant mice with the conditional 2 catenin/loxP (ex3) mouse, resulting in mice with constitutively active 2 catenin in the epicardium. Completion of this proposal will unravel the mechanisms of retinoid/2 catenin signaling in coronary formation and ventricular compaction and might offer the potential for therapeutic interventions to ameliorate or even treat coronary disorders that are leading causes of mortality.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States in both men and women. In 2006, more than 174,470 new cases of lung cancer are estimated in the United States alone, and 162,460 of lung cancer-related death. The data reflect our lack of ability to improve survival and quality of life of the patients under current treatment strategies. Targeted therapy, a newly emerged therapeutic approach aiming key molecular abnormalities in cancer progression, has shown encouraging results, such as the development of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors for patients with lung cancer. We recently discovered that hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF), a mitogen for both stroma cells and epithelial cells, is frequently overexpression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for >80% of all lung cancers, and the overexpression is strongly correlated with tumor relapse and poor survivals. We further demonstrated that HDGF is involved in malignant transformation, tumor progression, and invasion. We have developed a panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against HDGF. Our preliminary data show that the antibodies are effective in inhibiting lung cancer growth in xenograft tumor models, suggesting HDGF is a novel therapeutic target. We hypothesize that HDGF is a critical factor in progression of NSCLC and a novel therapeutic target. To test the hypothesis, we proposed three specific aims in this application: In Aim 1, we will determine the role of HDGF as a prognostic marker for patients with NSCLC by analyzing expression of HDGF in primary NSCLC and correlating the expression with clinicopathologic parameters. The correlation between HDHF expression and other angiogenic factors and potential HDGF downstream molecules will also be determined. In Aim 2, we will determine the therapeutic role of HDGF neutralizing monoclonal antibodies in NSCLC xenograft models and to reveal potential mechanisms of the anti-tumor effects. We will emphasize the use of the antibodies as a single agent with limited combination to prove of principles. In Aim 3, we will verify the therapeutic effects of the HDGF neutralizing antibody based regimens in heterotransplant tumor models and to identify selective and/or predictive biomarkers for anti-HDGF based therapy. The success of the project will provide strong rationale and scientific knowledge to guide development of anti-HDGF therapy for patients with lung cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is a novel molecule important for lung cancer progression. This study will evaluate the role of HDGF as a prognostic marker for identifying lung cancer patients likely to recur or metastasize after curative surgical treatment. We will also evaluate our newly developed neutralizing monoclonal anti-HDGF antibodies for their utility as therapeutic agents in lung cancer treatment.

United States, making it an increasingly important public health problem. While patients with early stage
thyroid cancer are usually successfully treated, the survival rate for patients with distant metastatic or
nvasive disease is approximately 40% at 5 years. The pathways responsible for thyroid cancer progression
are not clear. We have observed that the invasive fronts of aggressive thyroid cancers display an epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like gene expression profile that differs from the central regions of the tumors.
The association between EMT and thyroid cancer invasion was further demonstrated in a larger validation
series in which overexpression of vimentin was independently associated with tumor invasiveness. The
overexpression of mesenchymal proteins occurred in invasive PTCs that expressed BRAF V600E or
RET/PTC oncogenes. In vitro studies demonstrated the requirement of vimentin expression for thyroid
cancer migration and for the development of a mesenchymal phenotype in thyroid cancer cells. p21-
activated kinases (PAKs) are master regulators of actin rearrangement and cell polarity and motility that are
downstream of PDK1 and other pathways activated in thyroid cancer. Enhanced expression of PAK
regulators and effectors was noted in the expression arrays and increased levels of total and phosphorylated
PAK were identified in primary thyroid cancers. Subsequent in vitro data support an association between
PAK activity and expression and function of RET/PTC and BRAF V600E oncogenes, and a role for PAK in
thyroid cancer motility. Because our goal is to target invasive or progressive thyroid cancers, we also tested
OSU-03012, a novel kinase inhibitor that competes with targets involved in EMT in vitro. The goal of this
proposal is to define the role and upstream regulation of PAK in thyroid cancer EMT; determine the
downstream mechanism for PAK-regulated EMT focused on pathways identified in our preliminary studies;
and to determine if OSU-03012 influences thyroid cancer cell development and progression in vivo."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Here, we examine the molecular mechanisms regulating synovial tissue and its destructive behavior in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The synovial lining is made by the compaction of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and macrophages. In inflammatory arthritis, this lining undergoes marked hyperplasia and yields the pannus tissue that extends onto and migrates over the cartilage and degrades it. The major mesenchymal cells of the synovial lining, the FLS, are responsible for producing the destructive enzymes (MMP, MT-MMP and cathepsins) that degrade the cartilage. We found that one of the cadherins, cadherin-11, is expressed in FLS and is a major factor in their cellular adhesion and organization into a synovial lining structure. Further, this synovial cadherin plays a key role in regulating FLS migration, invasion and production of MMPs that are relevant in rheumatoid arthritis. We found that the synovial lining is hyperplastic in cadherin-11 deficts. We will do this by defining the role of cadherin-11 in regulating FLS migration (Part I) and FLS invasion (Part II). In Part I, we will determine how cadherin-11 influences integrin mediated FLS migration on extracellular matrix (ECM) (Aim 1) and how it controls FLS migration over other FLS (Aim 2). We hypothesize that cadherin-11 and its ability to bind p120catenin at its cytoplasmic tail are essential to the process by which FLS respond to potent stimuli to migrate (Aim 3). This includes a process by which FLS ""let go"" of existing adhesion contacts by internalizing their adhesion molecules in specialized membrane ruffles, following which actin cytoskeletal reorganization extends the leading edge and pulls up the trailing edge of the cell as it moves forward. New adhesion molecule contacts form to provide attachment and traction for movement. We show how cadherin-11 participates in and regulates these steps in cell migration. Then, in Part II, we show that cadherin-11 blockade oynovium mediates joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis.   
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rheumatoid arthritis affects 1 percent of the population in the U.S. and results in disabling damage to the joints of the body. Inflammation causes pain and swelling and stimulates a special tissue in the joints, called the synovium, to attack and destroy the cartilage. We found a unique molecule that holds the cells of the synovium together. When we block this molecule, it stops how the synovium causes cartilage damage in inflammatory arthritis. We are working out the mechanism by which this occurs in order to understand how to target this molecule in treating rheumatoid arthritis.

DESCRIPTION (Provided by applicant):  
  
The International Colloquium on Pulmonary and Airway Fibrosis to be held in Sea Trail, NC, on September 28 - October 1, 2008, will be the 15th in a series of meetings that have occurred biannually since 1980 in different venues alternating between North and Central America and Europe. Due to fast-moving changes and discoveries related to fibrotic lung disease, several topics (including origin and roles of mesenchymal cells, telomerase activity, microRNAs, genetic susceptibility and epigenetic regulation, novel genes, pleural fibrosis, clinical and therapeutic advances, etc.) clearly need a forum where scientists from different disciplines can interact and bring new basic findings to the translational area from where clinical trials can be initiated. This colloquium will offer a unique opportunity for scientists involved in fibrosis research to present their latest progress and to exchange ideas and new state-of-the-art technologies, thus bringing together a diverse group of scientists from several countries who usually do not meet at such a highly directed and focused conference. The Specific objectives of the conference are: 1) To bring together world authorities and young scientists, including junior investigators and pre- and post-doctoral fellows as well as physicians and clinical investigators, in the disciplines of lung and airway injury, repair and fibrosis, at the cellular and molecular levels, molecular biology of fibrogenic growth factors and their cognate receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, inflammatory mediators, epithelial- mesenchymal interactions, animal models, genetics of human populations and emerging therapeutic approaches. 2) To provide a forum for presentation of new research findings and technologies, exchange of ideas, and collaborations among basic scientists, translational and clinical researchers. 3) To assure adequate representation of women, minorities, and young investigators through planning and organization of the meeting. Fibrosis, which is excessive scarring, occurs in the lung and airways in several diseases, and can lead to compromised lung function, difficulty in breathing, and even death. There is very little known about the way that fibrosis occurs at a cell and molecular level, and there are no effective drugs or therapies to treat it. This proposed ""15th International Colloquium on Pulmonary and Airway Fibrosis"" to occur in North Carolina in fall of 2008, will offer a unique opportunity for scientists involved in basic, translational and clinical research on fibrosis to present their latest progress and to exchange ideas and new state-of-the-art technologies, with the goal of developing new drugs and therapeutic strategies to treat patients with these diseases.

Our results demonstrate a 3-fold greater incidence of angiotensin II (Angll)-induced AAAs in male ApoE-/-
mice compared to females. Ovariectomy did not influence Angll-induced AAAs. In contrast, orchiectomy
reduced AAA incidence to the level observed in females. These results demonstrate that male sex
hormones mediate gender differences in Angll-induced AAAs. Additional data demonstrate greater Angll
receptor density and responsiveness in the abdominal aorta of male than female mice. We hypothesize that
during development, androgen localizes the AT1a receptor to vascular smooth muscle cells of the abdominal
aorta of male mice and continues to increase AT1a receptor expression in cell types critical to the formation
of AAAs in adult male mice. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the temporal effect of exogenous
testosterone administration on AAA formation and localization. The effect of exogenous testosterone in
orchiectomized male and in female mice on Angll-induced AAAs will be determined. A focus will be on
regulation of the AT1a receptor in the abdominal aorta of male1 and female mice administered testosterone.
In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the cell type mediating androgen receptor effects on AAA formation.
The effect of whole body androgen receptor deficiency on Angll-induced AAAs will be examined in male
mice. Since macrophages and smooth muscle are involved early in Angll-induced AAAs, we will determine
the effect of deficiency of androgen receptors on bone marrow-derived cells and on smooth muscle on Angllinduced
AAAs. Additional studies will define mechanisms for androgen regulation of the AT1a receptor
promoter. In Specific Aim 3, we hypothesize that in utero developmental effects of androgen on the
mesenchyme give rise to AT1a receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells of the abdominal aorta in adult
male mice, thereby localizing AAAs to this region. We will determine the effect of androgen ablation in utero
in males, and testosterone administration to neonatal female mice on Angll-induced AAAs in adult offspring.
Results from these studies will identify mechanisms for gender differences in AAA formation."," ",

hyaluronan (HA)-based matrix that is synthesized by airway smooth muscle (ASM) and airway epithelial (AE)
cells in response to pathological stimuli (viral, allergen) and that modulates asthmatic inflammation through
interactions with inflammatory cells (monocytes/macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils). Our data show that
cultures of ASM and AE cell cultures respond to poly(l:C) (a viral mimetic) and tunicamycin (endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress) by synthesizing HA-based structures that are highly and selectively adhesive for
binding non-activated monocytes as well as un-primed primary mast cells at 4 degrees C. At 37 degrees C, the adhesion of the monocytes is followed by a rapid (10-15 min) activation and phagocytosis of the HA matrix by a
mechanism that includes capping of CD44, a HA-binding cell surface protein on the monocytes that is
required for the phagocytic response. Additional strong, correlative histological data indicate that this
process occurs in vivo in asthmatic individuals and in the aeroallergen/pathogen mouse model of asthma
that is central to this Research Program. The same histological sections also show a strong ER stress
response in AE cells while nearby vascular endothelial cells do not. The aims of this Project are to treat
murine ASM cell cultures with poly(l:C) and determine: Aim 1) the mechanism by which HA is synthesized
and incorporated into the HA-based structures; Aim 2) the mechanism by which leukocytes adhere to these
structures; and Aim 3a) the mechanism by which monocytes cap and phagocytose the structures. Specific
Aim 3b will determine how primary mast cells (un-primed and primed) respond to incubation at 37 degrees C after
selective adhesion to the HA structures at 4 degrees C. Specific Aim 4 will develop a novel lift culture model for
growing AE cells on a native basement membrane substrate under conditions that promote AE differentiation
and determine the response of the differentiated cultures to poly(l:C) and tunicamycin. Transgenic mouse
models (null in CD44, in L-selectin, in both, and in TSG-6) will be used in the in vitro culture models and in
vivo in the murine aeroallergen/pathogen model to determine the contribution of these molecules in
formation of the HA matrix and the subsequent leukocyte adhesion and activation responses. This Project
interacts strongly with Project 1, which will determine leukocyte tyrosine nitration/oxidation parameters in
poly(l:C) and tunicamycin treated AE cultures with and without adhered monocytes; and with Project 3,
which will determine how eosinophils respond to interaction with the HA structures. The use of Cores B and

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The outflow tract of the embryonic heart contributes to the formation of the aortic and pulmonary artery. Defects in outflow tract development result in severe congenital heart defects such as persistent truncus arteriosus and double outlet right ventricle. Similarly, atrio-ventricular (A-V) cushions contribute to the formation of the mitral and tricuspid valves as well as to the septa of the adult heart. Abnormalities in A-V cushion development can result in severe congenital heart defects such as A-V canal or tricuspid and mitral valve atresias. Understanding how the outflow tract forms and the A-V cushions develop is therefore critical to understanding the development of many congenital heart defects. Classic studies have demonstrated the requirement of cardiac neural crest cells (CNCC) in the septation of the single outflow tract into the aortic and pulmonary arteries. More recent studies have provided new insight into the development of the myocardium of the outflow tract of the heart. These studies demonstrate the existence of heart precursor cells that are added to the outflow tract and right ventricle. Our preliminary data suggests that the Shh signaling pathway is critical for these ""anterior heart field"" (AHF) cells as well as for migratory CNCC during outflow tract formation and septation. In addition, Shh appears to be required for A-V cushion formation and therefore valve development. Loss of the Shh signal results in a single outflow tract (pulmonary artery atresia) and a single A-V valve. We propose that the cardiac defects seen in Shh mutants are due to abnormal development of both CNCC and the AHF during outflow tract development as well as abnormal endocardial cushion formation during valve formation. We propose examining the cell autonomous requirement for hedgehog signaling within AHF and CNCC in the coordinated development of the outflow tract using a Cre/LoxP approach. Similarly we will test the cell autonomous requirement of hedgehog signaling during A-V valve formation using genetic manipulations in the mouse.

mesenchymal cells, consequently ameliorating or exacerbating the progression of fibroproliferative lung disease. Two well-characterized models of lung injury will be used: 1) Brief exposure to inhaled asbestos fibers rapidly causes injury of the bronchiolar-alveolar epithelium and a fibroproliferative lesion at the alveolar duct bifurcations. Studies were carried out in female rats that have undergone whole bone marrow transplantation from male green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transgenic syngeneic rats. The Preliminary Data shown here demonstrate that there are significantly increased numbers of GFP-positive, Y chromosome-positive bone marrow-derived cells in the asbestotic lesions compared with
surrounding, uninjured tissues and with lungs from unexposed rats. Furthermore, the GFP-positive cells in the lung had both epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. Studies were also carried out in female rats injected intravascularly with 5 x 10[6] marrow stromal stem cells isolated from male GFP-transgenic rats. Our Preliminary Data demonstrate putative stem cells apparently attached to alveolar duct walls. Here we propose to define the subpopulations of stem cells that engraft and differentiate in injured lung and the effect they have on progression of asbestos-induced fibroproliferative lesions. 2) Denuded rat tracheae grafted into nude mice provide a milieu in which an epithelial lining can be reestablished, the characteristics of which is
primarily determined by the differentiation potential of the inoculated cells. Our Preliminary Data show that purified populations of airway epithelial cells mixed with bone marrow-derived cells form a differentiated epithelium in the tracheal graft system. Furthermore the bone marrow-derived cells in the graft appear to differentiate into epithelial cells, as well as endothelial cells that participate in revascularization of the grafts. Some stem cells appear to differentiate as mesenchymal cells. This system will be ideal for testing the postulate since varying numbers of specific stem cell subpopulations in different stages of differentiation can
be studied in combination with varying numbers and types of epithelial cells. There are no data available which allow us to predict whether or not the stem cells will play any role in the
degree of lesion development or participate in populating the tracheo-bronchial and  bronchiolar-alveolar duct walls. These studies will provide opportunities to develop therapeutic approaches through the use of adult bone marrow-derived stem cells because we know the precise anatomic and temporal distribution of the developing lesions. The stem cells will be characterized in, and we will be using the same populations of cells employed by investigators in the other projects. This will be a clear advantage for the final data analysis."," ",

States and worldwide. Thus, the development of preventive approaches using specific natural or synthetic
chemical corn-pounds (chemoprevention) is highly desirable to reduce the incidence of SCCHN. Several
chemo-pre-ventive regimens have been tested in preclinical and clinical settings, but no promising regimens
have been well documented. In this study, we propose to use a combination of green tea polyphenon E
(PPE) and erlotinib (Tarceva or OSI-774), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR), to prevent advanced premalignant lesions of the head and neck. Both PPE and EGFR-TKI
have shown strong anticancer activity and chemopreventive efficacy as single agents in a variety of cancer
types, including SCCHN. Our preliminary studies have shown that the combination of epigallocatechin
gallate (EGCG), a major polyphenol extracted from green tea, with erlotinib synergistically inhibited the
growth of SCCHN cells in vitro and in vivo. This inhibitory effect was associated with the induction of cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, this combination cooperatively reduced phosphorylation levels of
EGFR and AKT. Both EGCG and erlotinib also regulate expression and cell surface localization of E-
cadherin, suggesting that they may inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of the malignant
epithelial cells. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that combined treatment with PPE and erlotinib
can additively/synergistically inhibit carcinogenesis, as reflected by biomarker expression, in patients with
premalignant lesions of the head and neck. To test this hypothesis we propose the following specific aims:
(1) To under-stand the underlying mechanisms of the effect of combined treatment with EGCG (and/or PPE)
and erlotinib on signal transduction pathways responsible for SCCHN progression and survival; (2) To
conduct a phase I trial of combined treatment with PPE and erlotinib in patients with premalignant lesions of
the head and neck; (3) To identify biomarkers relevant for this treatment in patients' specimens and explore
correlative alterations in the proposed biomarkers with clinical and pathological findings. The clinical
development of this combination of agents as a cancer preventive regimen may contribute to reducing the
incidence of SCCHN. This may be further enhanced by the identification of tumor markers that can serve as
indicators for treatment efficacy."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The gene Sonic hedgehog (Shh) encodes a secreted signaling peptide that acts as a potent inducer of growth during fetal development. Secreted Shh peptide binds to a transmembrane receptor Patched (Ptc) and activates the hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction pathway. Hh pathway activation results in specific changes in gene transcription through the actions of 3 related Gli transcription factors. GN1 and Gli2 collaborate to activate transcription of hedgehog (Hh) target genes while Gli3 acts as a transcriptional repressor. Shh-Gli signaling plays a pivotal role in prostate growth regulation. It is necessary for normal ductal morphogenesis, is required for androgen-induced re-growth of the castrate prostate, and has recently been shown to promote prostate cancer growth and metastasis. The major goal of our research is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Hh signaling regulates prostate growth. During the previous cycle of funding, we focused on paracrine signaling. We showed that Shh secreted by the urogenital sinus (UGS) epithelium activates the Hh signal transduction pathway in the UGS mesenchyme. This induces expression of mesenchymal target genes and elicits paracrine signaling mechanisms that regulate epithelial proliferation and differentiation. However, recent evidence suggests that paracrine signaling is not the whole story. Shh also activates the Hh signal transduction pathway in the UGS epithelium and this autocrine signaling appears to play a specific and critical role in regulating the proliferation of epithelial progenitor cells. This proposal addresses the novel hypothesis that Hh-Gli signaling regulates prostate growth by a combination of autocrine and paracrine signaling mechanisms. Specifically, we postulate that autocrine signaling regulates epithelial progenitor cell proliferation while paracrine signaling regulates luminal cell proliferation and differentiation. We will use transgenic Gli1 and Gli2 mutant mice and tissue recombination experiments to quantitatively distinguish the actions of autocrine and paracrine signaling in prostate development. We will use cell based assays to define the mechanisms that regulate autocrine and paracrine signaling and then examine the effect of ectopic autocrine and paracrine signaling on cell proliferation and differentiation in vivo. We expect to show that bifurcation of Hh signaling into autocrine and paracrine actions effectively couples control of progenitor cell proliferation to the regulation of luminal cell proliferation and differentiation. This will introduce a novel paradigm into our efforts to understand normal growth regulation and offer important insights into the role of Hh signaling in prostate cancer where both autocrine and paracrine signaling have been shown to promote tumor growth.

Our observations raise an essential question: how does induction, mediated by specific molecular signals, influence the identity of specific cell classes in the developing olfactory pathway? To address this question we will evaluate the hypothesis that inductive signaling molecules, acting in the context of M/E interactions, regulate the generation and differentiation of olfactory pathway neurons via their action on molecularly distinct precursor cell populations. We will evaluate this hypothesis in two Specific Aims: the first includes experiments that assess the mechanisms of M/E inductive signaling for establishing precursor populations that give rise to olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the olfactory epithelium, and the second addresses the role of M/E induction in establishing precursors of olfactory bulb interneurons (OBIs: including olfactory granule cells and periglomerular cells). We have developed several in vitro assays, complemented by in vivo approaches, to pursue these aims. Our experiments permit us to manipulate signaling via RA, FGF8, Shh and BMPs using either pharmacological approaches or genetic mutations that result in either loss or gain of function for each signal. Using these tools, we will assess the relationship between signaling via RA, FGF8 and BMP4 and the establishment of molecularly distinct ORN precursor populations as well as the acquisition of functional properties that characterize the mature ORN. In addition, we will evaluate the role of signaling via RA, FGF8, Shh and BMP4 in the context of M/E interaction for OBI development. We will examine the role of signaling patterning the expression of transcriptional regulators associated with OBI precursors in the lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) as well as facilitating the specific migration of OBI precursors to the rudimentary olfactory bulb as well as their initial differentiation. The results of our experiments will permit us to define the specific contributions of several essential molecular signals to establishing two cell types that must not only be generated during early forebrain development, but that will continue to be generated and integrated into functional circuits from precursor populations that remain in the adult forebrain. Thus, our results will indicate how inductive signals act to define neuronal classes during initial development of a major functional division of the forebrain, the olfactory pathway, as well as how specific signals might contribute to the ongoing regeneration and repair of these forebrain neurons and circuits throughout life.","402285",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The lung airways form through a reiterative process of branching morphogenesis with concomitant cellular differentiation that is regulated, in part, through the activity of multiple signal transduction pathways. Accumulating evidence points to a role for both positive and negative signals from these pathways, which are regulated in a spatial and temporal manner during lung morphogenesis. The action of these pathways results in the distinct proximal-distal patterning observed in the lung airways, which is essential for the proper differentiation of airway epithelia into the active gas exchange interface in mammals. We have recently demonstrated a critical role for the Wnt signaling pathway in lung airway development and differentiation. Our studies show that inactivation of Wnt7b results in severe lung hypoplasia resulting from inhibited airway branching as well as defects in mesenchymal proliferation and type I cell differentiation. We have more recently demonstrated that inactivation of the canonical Wnt pathway in lung epithelia either by loss of (-catenin expression or expression of the Wnt inhibitor dkk1 leads to a loss of distal airway epithelium by acting upstream of essential transcriptional and signaling factors including N-myc, BMP4 and FGF signaling. Furthermore, we have identified the co-receptor complex in lung epithelium that transmits canonical Wnt signals through Wnt7b. Our hypothesis is that Wnt signaling plays a critical role in embryonic lung airway development, primarily through controlling patterning and differentiation of the airway epithelium. Since much is still not understood about the basic mechanisms underlying Wnt signaling in lung epithelial differentiation and development, we propose to further define the role of Wnt signaling by 1) determining the underlying in vivo mechanism involved in canonical Wnt signalings role in proximal-distal airway petterning, 2) determine the role of non-canonical Wnt signaling in the regulation of lung airway morphogenesis and differentiation, and 3) define the cellular mechanism by which both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling regulates lung epithelial cell differentiation, motility, and growth. These aims will address the ""where"", ""why"", and ""how"" Wnt signaling controls lung epithelial development, which is critical to a better understanding of how defective lung epithelial differentiation leads to human disease. Project narrative: Lung disease is a leading cause of death and morbidity in both neonates and adults. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive lung epithelial differentiation will allow for better design of future therapies for lung diseases. The current proposal uses novel state-of-the-art genetic models to determine the role of the Wnt signal transduction pathway in regulating lung epithelial differentiation with the ultimate goal of determining whether this pathway is a potential target of therapeutic intervention.

After birth, the follicle repeatedly cycles through periods of growth, regression, and rest, making it a unique model for studying organogenesis in postnatal life. Work from our lab and others has established that secreted Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which is produced by follicle epithelium and signals to both epithelial and mesenchymal follicle progenitors, is an indispensable regulator of embryonic hair follicle growth, but not differentiation. We have shown that the primary target for Shh in developing hair follicles is the epithelium, and that the proliferative response to Shh is mediated by the transcription factor GH2. We have also found that the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is involved in the formation of oil-producing sebaceous glands, and that focal activation of Hh signaling is sufficient to drive epithelial bud development, a process previously shown to be controlled by Wnt signals. We hypothesize that epithelial Hh signaling can initiate epithelial bud formation in the absence of a mesenchymal signal, and that the Hh pathway normally drives cell proliferation during periods of active follicle growth after birth. In addition, we propose that Hh signaling has a crucial function in sebocyte development. To test these hypotheses, we have developed conditional mouse models that enable precise spatial and temporal control of Hh signaling activity. These models will be used to: 1) ascertain whether Hh signaling stimulates growth of follicle epithelium by acting directly on stem cells, their progeny, or both; 2) determine the precise function of Hh signaling in sebaceous gland development and maintenance; and 3) explore the mechanism by which ectopic, focal activation of Hh signaling leads to formation of epithelial buds. Given the widespread importance of Hh signaling in embryogenesis and cancer development, our findings in the hair follicle are likely to facilitate understanding of physiologic and pathologic Hh signaling in a variety of other organs.","282962",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Regulation and function of the YAP transcription co-activator oncoprotein   
  
The yes-associated protein YAP is a potent transcription co-activator. Recent genetic studies have implicated YAP as a candidate oncogene in human chromosome 11q22 amplicon. Drosophila studies have established a novel tumor suppressor pathway Hippo that regulates both cell proliferation and apoptosis. Many components of the Hippo pathway are highly conserved. YAP is likely to be the major target inhibited by the Hippo pathway. YAP can functionally rescue yorkie (the Drosophila homolog of mammalian YAP) mutation in Drosophila. It has been suggested that the neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) tumor suppressor is a component of the Hippo pathway acting upstream of YAP to inhibit YAP function. However, the Hippo pathway has not been investigated in mammalian cells. The long term goals of this project are to determine the function and regulation of the Hippo pathway in development of human cancers. Our preliminary data have shown that the Hippo-YAP pathway plays an essential role in cell contact inhibition and oncogenic transformation. Furthermore, YAP is highly elevated in human cancers, including prostate and liver cancers. The specific aims of this proposal are:   
  
1. To identify and characterize YAP target transcription factors   
2. To determine the function of YAP target transcription factors in cell contact inhibition, oncogenic transformation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition   
3. To determine the function of YAP-induced micro RNA   
  
Public Health Relevance: YAP is a transcription co-activator and oncogene highly elevated in human cancers. This proposal will study the molecular mechanism of YAP in tumorigenesis by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell death.

Mesenchymal stem cells or marrow stromal cells (MSCs) are a subset of adult stem cells from bone marrow. These cells are of medical and therapeutic interest because they have been shown to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, myocytes, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Due to their inherent plasticity, these cells have the potential to be useful for the treatment of a large number of genetic diseases. Dr. Bunnell has successfully defined the requirements for the expansion and characterization of rhesus macaque MSCs.  The Stem Cell Production Core Facility (SCPC) focuses on generation, maintenance and distribution of nonhuman primate MSCs. We routinely prepare MSCs from rhesus macaque bone marrow and adipose tissue samples. We presently have a bank pf MSC cell lines generated from over 100 rhesus macaques of varying age prepared and ready for distribution. The SCPC presently has a large impact not only on the Gene Therapy Program, but on other divisions such as Comparative Pathology within the TNPRC, but also Departments and Centers within the Tulane Health Sciences Center and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center and other research labs nationally.
Produce rhesus macaque stem cell preparations for collaborative research projects. For this we plan to use the techniques developed over the last funding period to isolate stem cells (MSCs, NSPCs and ESCs) to expand the bank of various stem cell types isolated from animals of various ages (fetal, newborn and adults) and sexes of animals. The cells will be used to generate large cell banks for use internally or externally by collaborating scientists. Additionally, we will work with scientists interested in performing autologous transplantation studies by generating MSC banks from specific animals for their research programs.
Continue the characterization of nonhuman primate stem cells. Our goal in these studies will be to delineate the cellular and molecular events that take place during maturation and/or differentiation of the various stem cell populations. Scientists in the division will continue to compare the biologic properties of the various stem cells in vitro. Assays mediating in vitro differentiation specific to rhesus stem cells that will maximize the differentiation and proliferation of MSCs and their progeny will be generated. One focus of the in vitro characterization will be the differentiation along neural lineages for all of the stem cells described. In order to accomplish the treatment of Krabbe's disease, stem cells will need to undergo differentiation into oligodendrocytes. A significant effort will be made towards the development and application of differentiation protocols to accomplish this goal.
Fully develop assays for the detection of the engraftment of stem cells. Most importantly, the division will play a significant role in the generation of assays for the assessment of engraftment of nonhuman primate stem cells in vivo in both murine and nonhuman primate models. Over the last funding period, the division established technologies for the routine detection of NHP cells in murine models using antibodies to human nuclear antigen, which readily permits the detection of NHP cells. The division has in place staining for BrdU and direct immunofluorescence assessment of EGFP. Over the next funding period, the division will need to focus on the detection of NHP cells in NHP tissues, using technologies such as in situ hybridization for the Y chromosome or detection of cells using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This will provide us an opportunity to collaborate with the Genetics and Genome Banking core in the Division of Veterinary Medicine and the DNA Microarray and Expression Core in Bacteriology and Parasitology on the application of SNPs for stem cells detection, as these cores will be developing SNP technologies for the testing of parental lineages.
Combining stem cell and gene transfer technologies for use in the rhesus Krabbe's disease model.  Our goal is to characterize the requirements for effective gene delivery and expression in stem cells and their differentiated progeny both in vitro and in vivo. The gene transfer efficiency of our various vector systems for nonhuman primate stem cells will be characterized. This will permit us the opportunity to generate banks of stem cells labeled with reporter gene elements, EGFP or beta-galactosidase. More importantly, we will assess the requirements that provide for high levels and protracted duration of gene expression in rhesus MSCs both in vitro and in vivo following transplantation."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A subset of cells in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been identified that enjoy a unique capacity to regenerate tumors. These brain tumor stem cells (BTSC) can be segregated by the neural stem cell marker, CD133, and are widely believed to be the cells responsible for resistance to conventional therapies. An effective means of specifically eliminating these cells may reduce the need for intensive and non-specific conventional therapy and lower the risk of tumor recurrence. EGFRvIII is a tumor-specific mutation found on BTSC. We have successfully targeted EGFRvIII using a peptide vaccine that allowed rapid translation to an ongoing Phase III trial. EGFRvIII expression is heterogeneous, however, and the recurrence of EGFRvIII-negative tumors suggests that BTSC can rely on other oncogenic pathways. While our data suggests that targeting tumor-specific mutations in BTSC may be important, few highly-conserved tumor-specific mutations like EGFRvIII will be identified and antigen defined vaccine approaches will ultimately be limited. Dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with amplified total tumor RNA is an innovative strategy to induce cellular and humoral antitumor immune responses. Although CD133(+) BTSC are a minority subpopulation of GBM that cannot be reliably isolated or propagated in sufficient quantities to serve as an antigen source for human vaccination protocols, we have been able to reproducibly amplify the RNA content from as few as 500 sorted CD133(+) tumor cells to generate RNA libraries sufficient for clinical scale DC-based vaccination. In order to focus the immunologic response on antigens preferentially or uniquely expressed within BTSC and limit the potential for autoimmune reactivity against shared antigens expressed in normal cells, we will evaluate approaches to enrich for antigens preferentially or uniquely expressed in BTSC by using full length cDNA affinity based substractive hybridization or an innovative strategy that leverages the ability of the DNA mismatch binding protein, MutS, to isolate cDNAs that contain tumor-specific mutations. These various preparations will be evaluated for differential toxicity and efficacy in an inbred transgenic murine malignant astrocytoma model, in which a subpopulation of CD133(+) tumor cells with BTSC qualities have been identified and CD8(+) and CD4(+) epitopes have been found. If efficacy is seen, the least toxic strategy will be translated into a Phase I study within the context of our existing clinical trial platform. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Treatment for malignant primary brain tumors, which are the most common cause of death among children and account for more deaths in adults than melanoma, currently represents the most expensive medical therapy per quality-adjusted life-year saved currently provided in the United States. A subset of malignant primary brain tumor cells (BTSCs), called brain tumor stem cells, enjoy a unique capacity to regenerate tumors and to resist conventional therapies. In this proposal we will see if targeting antigens preferentially or uniquely expressed by BTSCs will enhance the efficacy and reduce toxicity of immunotherapy.

Project Narrative
Bone healing is complex process involving a number of different factors. Although the delivery of BMPs as
recombinant proteins can induce local bone formation and healing of bone defects, we have demonstrated
previously that local gene transfer of BMPs results in more rapid and efficient bone healing. We have shown
that gene transfer of the LIM Mineralization Protein (LMP) can induce osteogenesis and bone formation as or
more efficiently than BMP-2. The goals of this proposal are to identify the domains in LMP required for
osteogenesis, to begin to examine the mechanisms through which LMP is able to induce osteogenesis and to
examine the ability of the LMP-based domains to induce bone formation in vivo following gene and protein-
transduction mediated delivery. The successful completion of the proposal experiments will lead to a better
understanding of the pathways important for induction of osteogenesis by LMP and will result in clinically
relevant approaches to stimulate new bone formation using LMP peptides.","NIAMS","7577134","9/9/2008 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01AR051456-01A2","1","R01","AR","051456","01","A","WANG, FEI","9/10/2008 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","1888670","ROBBINS, PAUL D.","Not Applicable","18","GENETICS","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","US","40.444001","-79.956102","2059802","UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH","PITTSBURGH","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","152133320","UNITED STATES","N","9/10/2008 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2008"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","  
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bone healing is complex process involving a number of different factors including soluble factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), signaling / transcription factors, nuclear transcription factors as well as extracellular matrix components. Although the delivery of BMPs as recombinant proteins can induce local bone formation and healing of bone defects, we and others have demonstrated previously that local gene transfer of BMP-2 at the site of critical size femoral and cranial defects in the rabbit and rat resulted in more rapid and efficient bone healing. More recently, we have shown that gene transfer of the LIM Mineralization Protein (LMP), a novel intracellular positive regulator of the osteoblast differentiation program, can induce efficient bone formation. In humans, three different LMP splice variants have been identified, termed LMP-1, LMP-2, and LMP-3. Gene transfer of human LMP-1 and LMP-3 induces expression of genes involved in bone formation including certain bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), promotes bone nodule formation in vitro and ectopic bone formation in vivo, facilitates healing of rat segmental and mandibular bone defects critical size defects and can facilitate posterior thoracic and lumbar spine fusion healing. We also have shown that LMP can induce myogenesis, under certain conditions, in culture. We have demonstrated that at least four different regions of LMP-1 and an additional domain in LMP-3 can contribute to osteogenesis. In partiular, a 20 amino acid region in LMP-3, termed Osteoinductive Domain-1 (OD-1), is able to induce mineralization and bone specific gene expression in cell culture and confer induction of ectopic bone formation in vivo. A synthetic OD-1 peptide fused to a protein transduction domain also was able to induce mineralization and bone specific genes. Thus the goals of this proposal are to identify the minimal as well as optimal LMP-1 and LMP-3 domains required for osteogenesis and myogenesis using cell culture assays, to examine the pathways through which the minimal, domains in LMP are able to induce osteogenesis (BMP signaling, RunX2/OSX transcription and/or MAP kinase) and to examine the ability of the LMP-1 and LMP-3-derived domains to induce efficient and appropriate bone formation in vivo following protein-transduction mediated delivery. The successful completion of the proposal experiments will lead to a better understanding of the pathways important for induction of osteogenesis by LMP and will result in clinically relevant approaches to stimulate new bone formation using LMP-derived peptides.

It is upregulated more than any other known protein with renal injury. KIM-1 protein is a Type I cell membrane glycoprotein containing extracellular immunoglobulin-like and mucin domains suggesting functional roles in cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions. We have cloned, and generated monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to, the human, mouse and rat KIM-1. KIM-1 is upregulated in vitro in MDCK cells adjacent to a mechanical ""wound"". The ectodomain of KIM-1 is cleaved and found in urine of patients with acute tubular necrosis or renal cell carcinoma. Gene transfer of KIM-1 in LLC-PK1 epithelial cells results in an increased number of cells with mesenchymal morphology and confers growth in soft agar. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the functional role of KIM-1 during the processes of adhesion and differentiation of epithelial cells. We hypothesize that KIM-1 reduces cell-cell and increases cell-matrix adhesion and potentiates epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the effects of KIM-1 on cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions of epithelial cells. In pilot experiments, we found decreased cell-cell aggregation of LLC-PK1 cells expressing KIM-1. CHO cells overexpressing KIM-1 ""scatter"" on various matrix substrates. KIM-1 expression results in loss of E-cadherin and increased cell-matrix adhesion. The roles of ERM proteins, integrins, Rho, integrin-linked and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases as effectors of KIM-1 actions on cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion will be explored. The contributions of the extracellular and intracellular domains of KIM-1 and tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular domain of KIM-1 in KIM-l's effects on adhesion will be evaluated. In the second specific aim, we will analyze the role of KIM-1 in the processes associated with dedifferentiation of renal tubular epithelial cells that are important for repair of the epithelium with both positive and potentially negative consequences. We will explore the role of TGF-beta in potentiating the effects of KIM-1 on cell differentiation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. A mechanism is proposed that implicates ERM proteins, Rho, integrin-linked and MAP family kinases as well as a-catenin and the transcription factor Snail, in the effect of KIM-1 on the differentiation status of the renal epithelial cell. KIM-1-expressing proximal tubules localize in areas of the kidney with increased fibrosis in a model of polycystic kidney disease and we will explore if there is an effect of KIM-1 expression on matrix protein production and extracellular matrix remodeling. Understanding the function of KIM-1 will provide important insight into the role of this protein in injury and repair processes of the kidney, and may identify KIM-1 as an important therapeutic target not only for acute and chronic renal disease but also for malignant transformation of the epithelial cell.","367029",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Effective wound repair requires a complex and integrated interplay of different cell types, pathways, and processes. Reepithelialization and restoration of barrier function is one requirement for successful healing and a process that is disrupted in chronic wounds. Genetic models have been pivotal for identification of genes that impinge on specific aspects wound healing, and we have obtained evidence that the developmental transcription factor Slug/Snail2 is a key regulator of epithelial outgrowth in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Slug and other members of the Snail family of proteins have been associated with regulation of adhesion and migration in development and cancer. The similarities between wound repair and developmental processes in the embryo are receiving increased attention, particularly with regard to the potential for shared regulatory pathways. Based on our evidence that Slug may contribute to regenerative processes in adult epidermis, this project will investigate the impact of Slug on keratinocyte outgrowth at wound borders. Our overall project goal is to understand mechanisms regulating the phenotypic plasticity of keratinocytes at wound margins during reepithelialization, and in doing so, shed light on processes that may be defective under conditions of impaired wound healing. In this proposal, our goal is to elucidate the events at the wound margin that are governed by Slug. We hypothesize that Slug plays central roles in regulating the partial and reversible epithelial-mesenchymal transition observed at wound margins. To test this hypothesis we will use a genetic model of Slug deficiency to 1) define the functional role of Slug in the keratinocyte activation program leading to cell proliferation and migration, 2) establish a molecular definition for the role of Slug in reepithelialization using microarray approaches and 3) establish whether elevated Slug expression augments wound repair in vivo using models of normal and impaired wound healing. These studies will provide information on the contributions of Slug to the functional and phenotypic plasticity required for successful reepithelialzation. Understanding key regulatory mechanisms in normal wound repair may identify new avenues for clinical intervention in medical conditions leading to impaired wound healing.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human adult skeleton undergoes continuous remodeling, a delicate balance between bone formation by the osteoblast and bone resorption by the osteoclast. Intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is able to greatly stimulate bone formation by acting through its receptor on the osteoblast. Recently, I, in Dr. Nicola Partridge's laboratory, identified that amphiregulin, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like ligand, is strongly upregulated by PTH in the osteoblast and that the EOF signaling pathway plays an important role in normal bone development. Although EGF-like ligands and their signaling pathways have been extensively studied in many tissues and cancers, there are few reports of them in the skeletal field due to the lack of evidence that they are expressed in bone and that they participate in remodeling. From my preliminary data, I hypothesize that EGF signaling participates in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal cell lineages, such as osteoblasts, adipocytes and chrondrocytes, and that PTH uses amphiregulin as the mediator to manipulate the microenvironment of bone marrow stromal stem cells. Thus, the goal of the present application is to delineate the role of EGF-like ligands, especially amphiregulin, in bone metabolism and in PTH's action on bone. To achieve it, I will use the following approaches: 1. Identifying amphiregulin target cells in bone and investigating how PTH treatment affects these cells, 2. Studying the effect of amphiregulin on the proliferation and differentiation of stromal stem cells, 3. Examining the physiological role of amphiregulin signialing in bone development and in PTH's action using animal models. The results of this work will provide insight into a novel and potentially important signaling pathway in bone development and metabolism and its role in PTH's action on bone.

The underlying mechanism of heart failure is not well understood. Fibulin-2 is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that marks epithelial-mesenchymal transformation during embryonic cardiovascular development but is significantly down-regulated in the postnatal life. Fibulin-2 expression is remarkably up-regulated in myocardial wound healing, indicating its possible role in myocardial fibrosis and ventricular remodeling.  
Our working hypothesis is that Fibulin-2 intermediates upstream signals to induce ventricular remodeling. To test this hypothesis, Fibulin-2 null mutant mice (Fbln2-/-) were generated by gene targeting technique.  Fbln2-/- showed no obvious phenotypic abnormalities compared with the wild type (WT) littermates and showed normal life span and fertility. (1) In vivo animal experiments: Both Fbln2-/- and WT were subject to myocardial infarction (MI) to induce heart failure. Hemodynamic, biochemical, and histological studies were performed to assess the biological role of fibulin-2 in ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. (2) In vitro newborn rat ventricular myocyte cell culture experiments: Ventricular myocytes are co-cultured with myocardial fibroblasts and are stimulated with angiotensin-II (Ang-II).  The effects of Ang-II over changes in ECM, morphology and proliferation of cells are examined.  Then the intrinsic fibulin-2 activity is inhibited by the fibulin-2 antibody to examine whether the neutralizations block the effect of Ang-II in ECM and cells.  To date we found that the following:  (1) Fbln2-/- resulted in better survival rate than WT at 2 weeks after MI (Fbln2-/- 78%, WT 44%). Although both revealed comparable myocardial hypertrophy, diastolic function was significantly well preserved in Fbln2-/-. Systolic function was better in Fbln2-/- than in WT. The degree of fibrosis is substantially decreased in Fbln2-/- myocardium; and  (2) Ang-II increased fibulin-2 expression in a dose-responsive manner at 24 and 48 hours.  Antibody blocking experiments will follow. In summary, absence of fibulin-2 preserved ventricular compliance despite comparable hypertrophy after MI. Our data suggest that fibulin-2 intermediates Ang-II related pathways in the formation of myocardial fibrosis and ventricular remodeling."," ",

This is very important since failure of these processes has been shown to lead to cleft palate, one of the most common birth defects in humans. Others and we have previously shown that during palatal fusion transforming growth factor-betas (Tgf-betas) induce several downstream responses that contribute to the successful palatogenesis. This proposal focuses on the role of epithelial and mesenchymal Tgf-beta signals in coordination of palatal fusion. Our overall hypothesis is: Tgf-beta/Bmp signaling events both in the palatal mesenchyme and in the epithelium are critical for successful palatal fusion and play a concerted role during palatogenesis. We propose to test this hypothesis by five Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we propose to determine the effect of neural crest cell specific abrogation of the Tgf-b type I receptor AIk2 on palatal development. In Aim 2, we propose to define the role of Tgf-beta type I receptors AIk2 and AIk5 in the palatal midline epithelium during palatal fusion, in Aim 3 we propose to determine the role of reciprocal epithelio-mesenchymal Tgf-beta signaling during palatal fusion, in Aim 4 we propose to analyze why direct contact between the palatal epithelium and mesenchyme can bypass the Tgf-beta3 signaling defect, and finally in Aim 5 we propose to determine the role of gap junctions in Tgf-beta-induced palatal midline epithelial fusion.   
  
Our unique experimental models and the state-of-art strategy allow us to determine the role Tgf-beta signaling via AIk5 and AIk2 in palatogenesis. Collectively, the proposed experiments are likely to be of critical importance in attempting to understand the molecular bases of facial and palatal cleftings in humans, and to develop possible therapeutic approaches to treat cleft palate during the fetal period.","147417",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Inherited or acquired abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract represent a large share of chronic disease in infants and children, often requiring costly long-term medical support or organ transplantation. Because these diseases constitute a costly healthcare burden, the study of Gl development is of high priority. Developmental biology of the digestive system aims to further the understanding of both congenital and acquired forms of pediatric gastrointestinal disease with the goal to ultimately advance therapies for Gl diseases. The vertebrate body is generated from three germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. The development of these three germ layers and the early reciprocal interactions between them are accepted to be conserved between species. The epithelium of the vertebrate gastrointestinal tract is derived from the endoderm and the muscular layers and mesenchyme are derived from the visceral mesoderm. It is understood that the endoderm and mesoderm need intrinsic and extrinsic factors for coordinated development of the Gl tract. This process, known as epithelial-mesenchymal interaction, is indispensable both for the development of the Gl tract and for its integrity into adulthood. The epithelium has been the focus of most studies to date because of the clinical implications of epithelial biology in the understanding and treatment of cancer. Recently the importance of signaling from the mesoderm/mesenchyme in tissue homeostasis and repair has been highlighted because of the implications for epithelial and stem-cell biology. Likewise, there is a conspicuous gap in the current knowledge of Gl development. It is less well understood how the mesoderm surrounding the gut develops and contributes to the development of the adjacent endoderm. Preliminary evidence suggests that Wnt signaling plays a major role in the patterning and maintenance of the visceral mesoderm and in its interactions with the adjacent endoderm. A potential mediator and of Wnt signaling appears to be FoxF1, the key transcription factor for the development and maintenance of the visceral mesoderm, previously known to be regulated by BMP4. Thus, it is the overall aim of this proposal to examine the role of Wnt signaling in development of the visceral mesoderm, its influence on endoderm development, and the role of FoxF1 and BMP4 in these processes.

A number of devastating cancers, including melanoma and neuroblastoma, are cancers of the neural crest. Moreover, neural crest cells share a number of general characteristics with metastatic tumor cells, and these two cell types have key molecular mediators in common, including Snail-family repressors and c-myc. 
This proposal seeks to exploit the considerable advantages of the Xenopus system in order to better understand the roles played by Snail-related factors and c-myc during normal neural crest development and in tumorigenesis, including the acquisition of invasiveness. The aims of the grant include: 1) determining the molecular mechanisms that underlie the distinct activities of Snail-family proteins during neural crest precursor formation, neural crest emigration, and during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) in tumor cells; 2) determining if c-myc regulates the expression of neural crest target genes by recruiting HAT activity to target promoters, and determining if Id3 functions as a Myc-effector during neural crest formation; 3) using cDNA macroarray-based gene discovery methods to identify the key transcriptional targets of c-myc and Snail-family repressors during neural crest precursor cell formation, and during the onset of neural crest migration and 4) testing the hypothesis that such targets will also play roles in tumor progression by examining the expression of these factors, and the effects of over-expressing these factors, in a panel of epithelial tumor cell lines","243714",

While loss or attenuation of TGFbet signal transduction is permissive for transformation, introduction of dominant negative TGFbeta receptors into metastatic cancer cells has been shown to inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), motility, invasiveness, survival, and metastases. In addition, there is evidence that excess production and/or activation of TGFbeta by cancer cells can contribute to tumor progression by paracrine mechanisms involving neo-angiogenesis, production of stroma and proteases, and subversion of immune surveillance mechanisms in tumor hosts. These data provide a rationale in favor of blockade of autocrine/paracrine TGFbeta signaling in human tumors with a therapeutic intent. Several treatment approaches are currently in early clinical   development and have been the focus of our laboratory during the last funding period. Many questions remain about the viability of an anti- TGFbeta treatment strategy, the best molecular approach for inhibition of TGFbeta function in vivo, the biochemical surrogate markers of tumor response, the molecular profiles in tumors for selection into clinical trials, potential toxicities, to mention a few. Therefore, in order to address these issues, we propose the following research aims in this competing renewal: 
Specific Aim 1: To determine if conditional deletion of TbetaRII in mammary cancer cells in vitro and in vivo inhibits autocrine TGFbeta signaling and tumor progression. 
Specific Aim 2: To determine whether therapeutic inhibitors of TGFbeta abrogate TGFbeta signaling and induce an antitumor effect both in vitro and in vivo. 
Specific Aim 3: To determine whether TGFbeta transactivates erbB receptors and elucidate if this   transactivation involves cleavage of erbB receptor trans-membrane ligands. 
Specific Aim 4: To determine if the activated type I TGFbeta receptor (Alk5) synergizes with HER2 (erbB2) in mammary tumorigenesis and whether it negates the therapeutic effect of HER2 inhibitors in vivo.","327478",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to PAR-04-023, participants from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), University of California Berkeley (UCB), Massachusetts general Hospital (MGH) and industry (GeneralElectric, GE) propose a competing renewal of a Bioengineering Research Partnership (BRP) focused on the systematic study of the morphology and function of the musculoskeletal system in disease and health. We hypothesize that high field (3 Testa and 7 Tesla), high resolution, fast MR combined with quantitative tissue assessment, would significantly impact the clinical assessment of musculo-skeletal degeneration and reparative processes, spanning a range of scales, from the tissue to the whole organ. The long- term vision of this partnership is to understand the link between morphology, function and clinical symptoms, with a specific focus on osteoporosis, osteo-arthritis, degenerative disc disease. The specific aims are: Aim I: To develop multi-modality imaging tools for in-vitro tissue characterization, including micro-computed tomography, Fourier transform Infra-red imaging for use in characterizing bone, cartilage, intervertebral disc. Aim II: To develop coils, pulse sequences and reconstruction algorithms for optimized parallel imaging at 3 Tesla for high resolution imaging of bone, cartilage, and intervertebral disc. Aim III: To develop quantitative MR imaging of trabecular bone, cartilage and intervertebral disc at 7 Tesla. Aim IV: To develop optimized MR imaging techniques at 3 Tesla and 7 Tesla in rodent models of disc and cartilage degeneration for tracking of iron oxide labeled mesenchymal stem cells in cartilage and disc repair. Dr. Majumdar from UCSF will serve as the PI of the BRP, and will be assisted by a Scientific and Clinical Advisory board. She will focus on the technical developments for musculo-skeletal imaging at high field with Dr. Kelley and Han from GE, and Link from UCSF (for clinical relevance). Dr. Lawrence Wald will serve as the partner from MGH. Dr. Vigneron from UCSF wj 11 serve as the project leader for coil development and testing at UCSF. Dr. Nelson will work closely with the PI in image analysis and processing aspects of the study.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to PAR-04-023, participants from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), University of California Berkeley (UCB), Massachusetts general Hospital (MGH) and industry (GeneralElectric, GE) propose a competing renewal of a Bioengineering Research Partnership (BRP) focused on the systematic study of the morphology and function of the musculoskeletal system in disease and health. We hypothesize that high field (3 Testa and 7 Tesla), high resolution, fast MR combined with quantitative tissue assessment, would significantly impact the clinical assessment of musculo-skeletal degeneration and reparative processes, spanning a range of scales, from the tissue to the whole organ. The long- term vision of this partnership is to understand the link between morphology, function and clinical symptoms, with a specific focus on osteoporosis, osteo-arthritis, degenerative disc disease. The specific aims are: Aim I: To develop multi-modality imaging tools for in-vitro tissue characterization, including micro-computed tomography, Fourier transform Infra-red imaging for use in characterizing bone, cartilage, intervertebral disc. Aim II: To develop coils, pulse sequences and reconstruction algorithms for optimized parallel imaging at 3 Tesla for high resolution imaging of bone, cartilage, and intervertebral disc. Aim III: To develop quantitative MR imaging of trabecular bone, cartilage and intervertebral disc at 7 Tesla. Aim IV: To develop optimized MR imaging techniques at 3 Tesla and 7 Tesla in rodent models of disc and cartilage degeneration for tracking of iron oxide labeled mesenchymal stem cells in cartilage and disc repair. Dr. Majumdar from UCSF will serve as the PI of the BRP, and will be assisted by a Scientific and Clinical Advisory board. She will focus on the technical developments for musculo-skeletal imaging at high field with Dr. Kelley and Han from GE, and Link from UCSF (for clinical relevance). Dr. Lawrence Wald will serve as the partner from MGH. Dr. Vigneron from UCSF wj 11 serve as the project leader for coil development and testing at UCSF. Dr. Nelson will work closely with the PI in image analysis and processing aspects of the study. The project will involve clinical faculty from Departments of Radiology, Orthopedic Surgery, Bioengineering students and post-doctoral researchers, all focused on advancing clinical evaluation of musculo-skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis, osteo-arthritis and lower back pain.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects approximately 8-12 million Americans. Many patients are not candidates for conventional treatments, e.g., surgical bypass or angioplasty, due to the extent and distribution pattern of their disease. Occlusive PAD may not only lead to pain at rest or with walking (claudication), but, if severe enough, may lead to distal limb ulceration and, ultimately, the need for amputation. Moreover, patients with critical limb ischemia have quality of life scores that are comparable to terminal cancer patient. Because the cues for new vessel formation are misplaced (due to the most ischemic areas occurring in the distal limb, i.e., foot, whereas the stenotic or occlusive artery is more proximal, i.e., iliac or femoral disease), exogenous cellular therapy offers a means to administer cells to the regions where they might be most helpful. This can be accomplished by either direct differentiation into blood vessels or by the release the appropriate cytokines to assist in neovascularization. Because patients' native stem cells are often dysfunction, allogeneic stem cells may offer the best choice of cellular products to provide off-the-shelf, high quality, cellular therapy for PAD patients. Clinical trials of cellular therapy will require methods to monitor delivery, engraftment, and therapeutic benefit in a non-invasive manner. In addition, current cellular therapies all suffer from extremely low engraftment primarily due to destruction of the cells in the first 24 hours after administration. Therefore, methods to protect stem cells from early destruction and also immunoprotect the patient from rejection of allogeneic cellular therapies that could be monitored non-invasively would be of tremendous benefit. In the current proposal, we will develop a novel method of combined radiopaque, MR-visible microencapsulation (XMRCap) of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that can be delivered and tracked non-invasively using x-ray fluoroscopy, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the R21 phase of the application, we will focus on three specific aims: 1.) the formulation of an optimized XMRCap that maintains cellular viability, is biocompatible, and demonstrates sufficient sensitivity for non-invasive imaging for delivery; 2.) demonstrate the ability to serially track XMRCaps with CT; and 3.) demonstrate that XMRCaps are immunoprotective and enhance cell survival. After achieving the R21 milestones, the R33 application will determine the degree of enhanced engraftment at 7 days post- administration and therapeutic efficacy by the ability to enhance arteriogenesis relative to naked MSCs in a relevant rabbit model of hindlimb ischemia. Because XMRCaps are composed of clinical grade products, we anticipate that these preclinical data will form the basis of safety and activity data for the FDA for translation of XMRCaps to therapeutic arteriogenesis clinical trials in PAD. Using a novel microencapsulation technique with clinical grade pharmaceuticals, the goal of the current application is to encapsulate stem cells from unrelated donors that can be seen by X-ray imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for precise delivery and tracking in patients. The microencapsulation will: 1.) prevent the rejection of foreign cells; 2.) enhance the survival of the cells compared to cells that are not encapsulated; and 3.) enable the stem cells to assist in the development of new vessels in patients whose arteries that are narrowed or occluded and who cannot be treated with conventional surgery or medical therapies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): TGFBI, induced by TGF-b1, is a fascilin-like protein and has been shown to be a component of extracellular matrix in a variety of human tissues. Using in vitro transformation systems, the applicant and his co-investigators have shown previously that loss of TGFBI expression is causally linked to tumorigenic phenotype in radiation/asbestos fibers-treated human bronchial epithelial cells, which is further substantiated by the studies that reconstituted expression of TGFBI in human lung cancer cells completely abrogate their tumorigenicity. Significant downregulation of TGFBI gene was found in various human tumor cell lines and in one-third of primary human lung carcinomas. Furthermore, hypermethylation of CpG island of TGFBI promoter correlates with the gene silencing. These findings suggest a significant role of TGFBI gene in human tumor progression. Using TGFBI-/- mouse model, the applicant and his co- investigators have provided the preliminary data showing an increased predisposition to spontaneous tumors in TGFBI-/- mice as well as an enhanced cell proliferation and aberrant activation of CREB and cyclin D1 in TGFBI-/- MEFs. This raises the following questions: Is increased frequency of spontaneous tumors in TGFBI-/- mice significantly higher than in wild type and heterozygous mice? What is the potential role of cyclin D1 upregulation in cell proliferation and spontaneous tumor development in mice with disruption of TGFBI gene? And, which signaling pathway is responsible for TGFBI-regulated cyclin D1 expression? To address these issues, a series of 3 specific aims are proposed to address the 3 testable hypotheses. The proposed studies are likely to have a significant impact on our current understanding of functional role of TGFBI loss in cell proliferation and tumor progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interaction between integrin and extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell adhesion and proliferation, anti-apoptotic death and tumor progression. TGFBI encodes a secreted protein that contains an integrin-binding site and promotes cellular adhesion and spreading. We have shown previously that TGFBI is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues, whereas its expression was either decreased or lost in a variety of human tumor cell lines as well as in one-third of primary human lung tumor samples. Recovered expression of TGFBI in human cancer cells that lack endogenous TGFBI protein significantly suppresses their tumorigenicity. We further demonstrate that promoter hypermethylation, one of the mechanisms by which tumor suppressor genes are inactivated in human cancers, correlates with silencing of TGFBI Promoter. These data suggest a tumor suppressor function of TGFBI in vivo. To study this hypothesis, we have succeeded in generating TGFBI-deficient mice. Preliminary data based on this model showed that lack of TGFBI expression results in an increased tendency to spontaneous tumor development in mice, and an enhanced cell proliferation and aberrant activation of CREB and cyclin D1 in TGFBI-null cells. These raise the following questions: Is increased frequency of spontaneous tumors in TGFBI-/- mice significantly higher than in wild type and heterozygous mice? What is the potential role of cyclin D1 upregulation in an increased cell proliferation and an enhanced spontaneous tumor development in TGFBI-/- mice? And, which signaling pathway is responsible for TGFBI-regulated cyclin D1 expression? To address these issues, a series of 3 specific aims are proposed to address the 3 testable hypotheses. Hypothesis 1: Disruption of TGFBI may contribute to tumorigenic progression. Specific Aim 1A-C will address this hypothesis and use the TGFBI-/-, heterozygous and wild type mice to compare the difference in frequencies of both spontaneous tumor growth and DMBA-induced skin tumors. Hypothesis 2: The cell cycle regulator, cyclin D1, may be critical in mediating TGFBI-regulated cell proliferation and tumor progression. Aim 2A will address whether silence of TGFBI in wild type MEFs can activate cyclin D1 and induce aberrant cell proliferation and cell transformation. In Specific Aim 2B, essential role of cyclin D1 upregulation in TGFBI-/- cells will be examined by silence of cyclin D1 expression. Suppression of cell proliferation and transformation phenotypes will be defined in cyclin D1-silenced TGFBI-/- cells. And Aim 2C will further address the importance of cyclin D1 upregulation using an in vivo mouse model. Hypothesis 3: TGFBI, a secreted protein, may regulate downstream targets through an integrin-associated signaling pathway. In Aim 3A, causal role of CREB activation in cyclin D1 upregulation will be defined. Aim 3B will determine whether an aberrant activation of CREB and cyclin D1 are due to a dysregulated PKA (Protein kinase A) activity. In Aim 3C, integrin receptor(s) and functional domain of TGFBI that are involved in TGFBI- integrin interaction and in the regulation of CREB and cyclin D1 activation will be identified. And in Aim 3D, aberrant signaling found in TGFBI-/- cells will be examined in spontaneous tumor tissues arising from TGFBI-/- mice to determine their significance in process of tumor progression. The proposed studies will provide the in vivo evidence for supporting the hypothesis that TGFBI possesses anti-tumor function. Since TGFBI is frequently down-regulated in primary human tumors, the data generated from this application are likely to have a significant impact on our current understanding of functional role of TGFBI loss in development of human cancers.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hedgehog (Hh) signaling regulates cell proliferation and differentiation in various organs during embryogenesis. In the pancreas, the role of this pathway is complex. At early stages, Hh signaling is excluded from the pancreas and ectopic activation of the pathway impairs pancreas formation by disturbing mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. In contrast to this inhibitory role, our preliminary data suggest a positive, cell autonomous role for Hh signaling during endocrine cell formation and function. The exact nature of this novel, cell autonomous activity remains to be elucidated. Little information is also available about the upstream mechanisms that regulate Hh signaling in pancreatic epithelium. Recent results have revealed that primary cilia, cellular appendages found on many cell types, control the level of Hh signaling activity. Primary cilia are present on adult duct and endocrine cells within the pancreas, the same cell types that are marked by expression of Ptc, a transcriptional target gene of Hh signaling. Our preliminary results indicate that cilia control activation of Hh signaling in pancreatic cells. In the first specific aim, we will address the cell autonomous requirement for Hh signaling in pancreatic epithelium. This will be accomplished by analyzing transgenic mice in which Smoothened, the gene coding for an essential component of the Hh pathway, has been eliminated specifically in pancreatic epithelial cells. In the second specific aim, we propose to elucidate the role of cilia in regulating the level of Hh signaling in pancreatic epithelium and in endocrine ¿-cells. Transgenic mice ectopically expressing GLI2, a transcriptional activator of Hh signaling, in pancreatic epithelial and ¿-cells that lack primary cilia have been generated for this purpose. In the third specific aim, we will perform cell culture experiments to analyze the mechanisms by which primary cilia control Hh activity in pancreatic cells. In summary, experiments proposed in this application will address the cell autonomous requirement for Hh signaling in pancreatic epithelial cells and the role primary cilia play in regulating the level of Hh activity in these cells. Given the distinct roles Hh signaling plays at different time points during pancreas and endocrine cell development and function, understanding of these effects will help to optimize strategies designed to generate functional ¿-cells from embryonic stem cells.

DESCRIPTION: (provided by the applicant):  
Reactive periosteal bone formation and post-inflammatory ossific joint ankylosis commonly develop at sites of ligamentous attachment to bone (entheses) in spondyloarthritis. Debilitating mobility loss and lung capacity reduction can result. How synovial and ligamentous immune response-driven inflammation are transduced to bony ankylosis in spondyloarthritis is not well defined. Here, we will study a classic model of spontaneous spondyloarthropathy characterized by synovitis and peripheral joint and intervertebral bony ankylosis in the ank/ank mouse, which express a natural truncation mutant of ANK, a multiple-pass transmembrane protein known to channel intracellular Ppi to the cell exterior. PPi, a potent physiologic inhibitor of hydroxyapatite deposition, has heretofore only been recognized as a regulator of calcium phosphate crystal growth. Based on novel data including mRNA microarray profiling, we propose the paradigm-shifting hypothesis that deficient ANK function stimulates pathologic endochondral ossification at entheses via expression of the inflammatory mediator vanin-1 pantetheinase, which we observe to promote chondrogenesis, and the chemokine GROa, which promotes chondrocyte maturation and calcification. First, we will define the basic mechanism for spontaneous development of chondroid metaplasia at entheses of ank/ank mice, and in doing so, test the specific role of vanin-1. We will test the hypothesis that ANK deficiency, extracellular PPi depletion, and vanin-1 synergistically promote chondrogenesis via an altered redox state and modulation of wnt signaling and N-cadherin expression in mesenchymal pluripotential cells. We also will test for ""phenotype rescue"" of ank/ank mouse bony ankylosis by crossing the mice with existing, phenotypically normal vanin-1 null mice. Second, we will test the role of KC/GROa in the spontaneous development of synovitis as well as calcification at sites of chondroid metaplasia at sponal entheses and periperal joint synovia of ank/ank mice. We will test for ""phenotype rescue"" of ank/ank mouse bony ankylosis by crossing the mice with existing, phenotypically normal KC/GROa null mice. These studies will identify novel targets for enthesopathic bone fusion in spondyloarthritis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Lung immaturity is a major cause of morbidity in premature infants and lung diseases affect millions every year. This grant addresses how lung development is controlled by the Nuclear Factor I B transcription factor (NFIB) and other NFI family members. We have shown that disruption of Nfib causes perinatal lethality in mice due to a failure in lung maturation. We hypothesize that Nfib expression in lung mesenchyme is essential for lung maturation. To test this hypothesis we will: 1) Identify target genes of Nfib needed for mouse lung maturation. Nfib knockout (KO) mice die at birth due to lung immaturity. We will find the target genes of Nfib in lung maturation, assess changes in growth properties of cells from Nfib-/- lungs and determine whether the block in maturation can be overcome by glucocorticoids, a standard treatment for human fetal lung immaturity. 2) Generate a conditional knockout allele of Nfib and eliminate Nfib function separately in different cell populations in the lung, to determine in which cells Nfib is needed for lung maturation. This will directly test of hypothesis that Nfib is essential in lung mesenchyme. 3) Determine how other NFI family members cooperate with or antagonize Nfib function in lung development by making mice deleted for 2 NFI genes simultaneously, Nfib+Nfic and Nfib+Nfix. We propose that these NFI genes interact with Nfib in lung development and in the development of other organs. These studies will yield new insights into the molecular mechanisms of lung development and how they are regulated by the highly-conserved NFI transcription factor family.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Runx1-CBFbeta transcription factor is required for the emergence of all definitive hematopoietic cells. It is the earliest specific marker of sites from which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells are produced in the conceptus. Runx1 is expressed in endothelial cells, mesenchymal cells, and in intra-aortic hematopoietic clusters, and in all committed hematopoietic progenitors and transplantable stem cells. We hypothesize that Runx1-CBFbeta is required, at least in part, for the transition between ""hemogenic endothelium"" and hematopoietic cells during fetal development. However, if Runx1 is deleted in adult mice, after hematopoiesis is established, long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells persist, committed erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic progenitors increase in number, and both erythropoiesis and terminal granulocyte differentiation are normal. Thus, there is an absolute requirement for Runx1-CBFbeta to establish hematopoiesis in the fetus, but not to maintain all aspects of it in the adult. One of our goals is to define the developmental window and cell types in which Runx1-CBFbeta is required to specify definitive hematopoiesis in the conceptus. A second aim follows up on recent findings that the placenta may be a source of hematopoietic stem cells. We will determine where in the placenta hematopoietic stem cells reside, and whether they differentiate from endothelial cells in the allantois or in the placental labyrinth. Finally, we will attempt to identify the signaling sources that induce the first wave of Runx1 expression and definitive hematopoiesis in the conceptus. We will specifically examine whether Hedgehog, the upstream component of a signaling cascade required for definitive hematopoiesis in zebrafish, activates Runx1 expression and definitive hematopoiesis in the mouse conceptus. Together these aims will contribute to our understanding of the earliest events that establish definitive hematopoiesis in the mouse conceptus, and should help guide efforts to produce blood cells from embryonic sources in vitro.

It is well established that the foundation for normal adult reproductive function occurs during fetal life and thus impairment of ovarian maturation in utero may result in irreparable loss of germ cells, endocrine function and reproductive potential in adulthood. Because of the difficulty in conducting in vivo studies during human pregnancy, however, little is known about the regulation of fetal ovarian development in utero and its impact on adult ovarian function. During the previous funding period, we demonstrated that estrogen receptors alpha and beta were expressed in the fetal ovary, and in baboon fetuses in which estrogen had been depleted by administration of an aromatase inhibitor during the second half of gestation, the number of primordial follicles was reduced by 50% with several of the follicles appearing unhealthy. Moreover, the number of interfollicular nests comprised of oocytes associated with but not enveloped by pregranulosa cells was increased and accompanied by
upregulation of alpha-inhibin expression. These findings, plus the observation that ovarian development was normal in fetuses in which estrogen levels were restored, support the hypothesis that estrogen regulates fetal ovarian development in the primate. Therefore, during the upcoming study period, we propose three studies to elucidate the mechanisms by which estrogen regulates fetal ovarian folliculogenesis and determine whether reproductive function and fertility in adulthood is impacted by estrogen programming of the ovary in utero. Study 1 will test the hypothesis that estrogen in utero in the baboon fetus promotes formation of healthy primordial follicles by regulating development of oocyte microvilli via their structural proteins ezrin and ezrin-binding protein. The goals of Study 1 and 2 are interwoven to test the hypothesis that estrogen regulates the envelopment of oocytes by pregranulosa in germ cell cords by down-regulating expression of inhibin and thereby increasing the ratio of activin to
inhibin, and enhances oocyte microvillus formation in newly formed follicles. Studies 1 and 2 are
translated into physiologic/clinical relevance in Study 3, which will test the hypothesis that the estrogen-dependent maturation of the primate fetal ovary in utero determines reproductive function and fertility in adulthood. The results to be derived from these experiments are expected to translate to and improve our knowledge of human female reproductive biology and fertility."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The T-box transcription factor TBX1 was recently identified as the gene responsible for the etiology of 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS). Conductive hearing loss occurs in a majority of patients with this syndrome, while sensorineural deafness has also been reported in some cases. Mutation of the murine orthologue, Tbx1, has proven to be an excellent model for this disease. Mice null for Tbx1 fail to develop an outer and middle ear, while the inner ear never develops beyond the otic vesicle stage. In addition, the cochleovestibular ganglion (CVG), which forms from the otic vesicle, is duplicated in Tbx1 null embryos. Epithelial and mesenchymal interactions are thought to play an important role in the development of the both the cochlea and vestibular system, however many of the signaling pathways that control inner ear development are not known. Tbx1 is expressed both in the otic vesicle epithelium and the surrounding periotic mesenchyme (POM). We hypothesize that Tbx1 signaling in the POM is required for cochlear development via a genetic interaction with the transcription factor Brn4. For Specific Aim 1, Tbx1 will be inactivated in the POM using the Cre/loxP system to create a conditional mouse mutant, enabling the isolation of the role of Tbx1 in this tissue. In Specific Aim 2, the interaction between Brn4 and Tbx1 in the POM will be tested by generating mice mutant for both genes. Heterozygous null mutations in either Tbx1 or Brn4 do not produce inner ear malformation. Compound heterozygous mice harboring mutations for both genes will be analyzed for inner ear defects. Achievement of these specific aims will provide a further insight into the role of Tbx1 in inner ear development and the genetic pathways in which it functions. Deafness is a major public health issue, and the genetic causes of deafness are still poorly understood. TBX1 is the gene responsible for many of the symptoms of 22q11 DS, including hearing loss. Understanding of how this gene contributes to normal ear development is crucial to gaining a better knowledge of the causes of congenital deafness and will lead to improved detection of this disease.

The pathogenesis of interstitial fibrosis is a remarkably monotonous process characterized by de novo activation of the matrix-producing myofibroblasts. Evidence indicates that a large proportion of interstitial fibroblasts are actually originated from tubular epithelial cells via epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the mechanism underlying tubular EMT remains elusive. Studies from the applicant's laboratory demonstrate that integrin-linked kinase (ILK), an intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase that interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of (-integrins, plays an imperative role in mediating tubular EMT and renal interstitial fibrogenesis. The central hypotheses of this application are that: 1) ILK is a central element of a multi-component cellular machinery, and the function of ILK depends on its interactions with key partners; 2) ILK plays an imperative role in the maintenance of tubular cell phenotypes and matrix homeostasis in vivo; and 3) ILK is a prime molecular target for designing an effective therapy for chronic renal fibrosis. These hypotheses will be tested in the following four specific Aims. Aim 1 is to investigate the ILK interactions with its partners and to elucidate their functional significance in mediating tubular EMT. Aim 2 will delineate the role of PINCH, a key partner of ILK, in mediating tubular EMT and renal fibrosis. Aim 3 is designed to investigate the physiologic and pathologic role of ILK in renal tubules in vivo by conditional knockout approach.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The periosteum is now widely recognized as a homeostatic and therapeutic target for actions of sex steroids and intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) administration. Androgens and PTH stimulate while estrogens suppress periosteal expansion in a number of experimental models. However, low estrogen concentrations may also promote periosteal expansion by direct actions or indirectly by permitting the stimulatory effects of androgens or mechanical stimulation. The mechanisms by which sex steroids and PTH influence this key skeletal envelope are not known. We have found that sex steroids and PTH have common properties in protecting periosteal osteoblasts from apoptosis. In sharp contrast, estrogens as compared to androgens and PTH have opposing actions to regulate the recruitment of early periosteal osteoblast progenitors. The estrogen receptor (ER) itself has important actions both as a site for liganded estrogen interaction and as an independent modulator. The liganded ER attenuates periosteal osteoblast differentiation while in its unoccupied configuration, it potentiates periosteal osteoblast differentiation. We hypothesize that sex steroids and PTH promote the survival of mature periosteal osteoblasts. In parallel, estrogens suppress whereas androgens, intermittent PTH, and the unliganded ER promote periosteal expansion by exerting opposite actions on the proliferation and differentiation of early periosteal osteoblast progenitors. The effect of combined estrogen and PTH administration to the periosteal surface reflects the relative balance between prolongation of osteoblast survival, an action shared by both hormones, and opposing actions of PTH and estrogens on proliferation and differentiation of progenitor periosteal osteoblasts. To test these hypotheses, we will examine whether estrogens versus androgens, PTH and unliganded ER differentially regulate differentiation and proliferation of distinct populations of periosteal osteoblast precursors. The contribution of pro-differentiating versus anti-apoptotic actions of sex steroids, intermittent PTH and the combination of PTH and estrogens to the periosteal expansion that occurs with skeletal maturity will be investigated in vivo. Finally, we will establish in vivo that the osteoblast-specific actions of estrogens account for their effects on periosteal bone mass. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which sex steroids and PTH act and interact to regulate periosteal preservation or expansion, could lead to new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of osteoporosis.

Gene expression profiling analysis revealed that Wnt5A induction causes the downregulation of many genes. The few genes upregulated by Wnt5A include those involved in tumor cell metastasis such as CD44, and vimentin, involved in an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Another gene upregulated upon Wnt5A overexpression was the gene p21.  We have shown that p21 protein expression is also increased in a high wnt5a expressing melanoma cell line (M93) as compared to a low-expressing wnt5a expressing one (G361). Moreover, siRNA inhibition of Wnt5A resulted in a decrease in p21 expression in M93 cells. P21 activated kinase has been shown to increase melanoma motility, and Wnt5A can inhibit proliferation of several cell types. We hypothesize that decreases in cell proliferation may coincide with increases in metastatic ability, and are pursuing various mechanism by which to study this.

Factors that induce the proliferation of melanoma cells include TGFbeta. Recent data from Hoek et al have shown that TGF-beta sensitive cells have higher proliferation rates, and are less metastatic. Those that are TGFbeta insensitive have lower proliferation rates, and are highly metastatic. Similarly, Wnt5A is expressed in this cohort, but not the other. Data from our laboratory indicates that indeed melanoma cells with more Wnt5A have increased expression of factors such as phospho-SMAD. What the link between tehee factors, WNt5A and melanoma progression may be is currently under investigation.

Finally, we are interested in the effects of the aging microenvironment on tumor progression. Older individuals who present with melanoma have a worse prognosis, and this could be due to factors such as decreased immunity, or changes in the microenvironment. Klotho is a gene that interacts with Wnts, and whose knockdown can lead to accelerated aging. We are studying the relationship between klotho and Wnt5A using melanoma as a model, and normal, aging skin. We are in the process of determining whether older skin fibroblasts have an increase in Wnt5a, and a loss of klotho. If this is so, we will ask if we can make melanoma cells more invasive if we co-culture them with old vs young fibroblasts. Further, we will knock  klotho out of the younger fibroblasts, and see what effects that has on secretion of different factors from these fibroblasts, and if we can accelerate senescence, and if those senescing fibroblasts make melanoma cells more invasive. On a long term basis we will also ask if oncogene induced senescence can influence surrounding cells in a co-culture system- eg, skin fibroblasts, and make them senesce and in turn, release factors that then cause tumor cells to invade. Gene expression profiling studies will also be performed to obtain a global overview of thes studies.","439301",

evidence shows that this strategy with whole bone marrow (wBM)preparations may improve LVEF in
patients with AMI. Studies with wBM and skeletal myoblasts (SKMB) have yielded promising results
suggesting improvement of LVEF in CHF patients. To further translate the findings of our group and others
into clinical practice we seek to participate in the Cardiovascular Cell Therapy Research Network (CCTRN).
This network will lead the field in developing and implementing cell therapy for the treatment of cardiac
dysfunction. Great advances have been achieved towards developing, understanding and implementing cell
therapy. Recent findings in clinical trials using wBM have highlighted the need for well planned trials that
focus on appropriate populations, have rigorous cell preparation, and ask important questions critical to
advance the field while assuring patient safety. We believe a collaborative center in Greater Cleveland
would be an excellent site for this NHLBI CCTRN. Cell based clinical trials already performed in the
Cleveland area include the RECOVER trial that studied the role of G-CSF in patients with AMI and moderate
to severe LV dysfunction, and participation in completed and on-going multi-center clinical trials testing
SKMB in CHF. This proposal represents a cohesive group of investigators interested in developing a center
at Case Western Reserve University that leverages the broad expertise that is present in the Greater
Cleveland area including: expertise in multi-center cardiovascular trials, non-invasive cardiac imaging, and
non-invasive arrhythmogenic risk assessment. Our Network site will draw patients from diverse hospital
centers in the community as well as tertiary care centers. Our group has been studying the potential of
allogeneic multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC)-based therapy for improving LVEF following AMI.
Allogeneic MAPC therapy for acute Ml is enticing because MAPC can undergo expansion in culture to > 70
doublings generating, from a single donor, a thousand doses that could be available whenever the patients
present. In SPECIFIC AIM 1 we will determine the efficacy of allogeneic MAPC in patient with AMI. We also
have a program to define the mechanism of stem cell homing to injured myocardium. We have shown that
the transient re-establishment of the stem cell homing molecule SDF-1is sufficient to induce homing,
vasculogenesis and recovery of myocardial function in preclinical models of CHF. In SPECIFIC AIM2 we will
test the feasibility of cell based gene therapy and demonstrate whether transient re-establishment of

Unique features including non-pathogenicity, low-immunogenicity and stable expression have positively resulted in successful preclinical and clinical evaluation of this vector. One of the potential, yet, unexplored areas of gene therapy using rAAV is metabolic bone defects characterized by a reduction in the mass of bone per unit volume as in osteoporosis or insufficient mechanisms for anabolic bone remodeling as in spinal fusion and fracture. Although, currently available hormonal and drug therapies for osteopenia aim to prevent further bone destruction by osteoclasts, therapies directed towards increasing bone mass by increasing the event of osteogenesis will be greatly beneficial. Treatments to increase bone density by anabolic agents are limited due to ineffective delivery methods and a short half-life of the drugs and purified proteins. Thus, novel methods to induce sustained in vivo osteogenesis should improve the pathophysiology of the disease.  
  
Our earlier studies established long-term efficacy of rAAV-transduced mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to selectively engraft to bone, repopulate and express a transgene in a mouse model. Preliminary studies pertaining to this application indicated that recombinant AAV-2 (rAAV) transduces human and murine MSC and osteoprogenitors in high-efficiency and that rAAV-mediated transfer of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) leads to their differentiation into osteoblast lineage. Thus, we hypothesize that autologous transplantation of culture-expanded MSC, transduced with rAAV encoding BMP-2 under the control of osteoprogenitor-specific promoters, will result in osteoblast enrichment and increased bone mass. In the current proposal, we will evaluate this hypothesis to: 1) Determine the engraftment of ex vivo cultured MSC and optimize enrichment of homing to bone by ectopic expression of a bone homing signal, 2) Determine bone-specific expression of BMP-2 and its osteogenic significance in vivo and 3) Determine the effects of AAV-mediated gene therapy in osteopenic mice models in vivo. A successful outcome of these studies may form the basis for future development of gene therapy approaches for osteoporosis and other osteopenic diseases in humans.","267698",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY: LMP-1 is an intracellular LIM domain protein identified in our laboratory which has demonstrated an ability to dramatically increase cellular responsiveness to BMP-2 in vitro. The long term goals of this proposal are to confirm the hypothesis that LMP-1 modulates cellular responsiveness to BMPs through regulation of proteasomal degradation of key molecules that are important for BMP-2 signaling. The specific aims are to demonstrate that LMP-1 increases responsiveness to BMP-2 by: 1) interrupting Smurf1-mediated proteasomal degradation of R-Smads (Smad1); 2) blocking interaction of Smurf1 with I-Smads (Smad6), interrupting l-Smad/Smurf1-mediated proteasomal degradation of the BMP receptor (BMPR1A); and, 3) interrupting Jab1-mediated proteasomal degradation of the common Smad (Smad4). Our final aim will identify the specific interacting motifs in LMP-1, enabling design of a small molecule to mimic the ability of LMP-1 to enhance cellular responsiveness to BMP-2. The methods employed will include protein isolation, in vitro transcription/translation, Western blotting, ELSA, ubiquitination assays, real-time RT-PCR, computational drug design techniques, in vitro testing of BMP-2 responsiveness, and in vivo testing of ectopic bone formation. RELEVANCE: One of the greatest clinical challenges in Orthopaedics is the inability to consistently generate bone for spinal fusion and bone defect reconstruction. Use of iliac crest bone graft may fail to achieve solid bony fusion in up to 45% of patients, and up to 25% may experience chronic pain at the donor site. The information learned from these experiments will further the understanding of the regulation of cellular responsiveness to bone morphogenetic proteins, the key regulators of bone formation, and potentially lead to the design of small molecules that could greatly enhance the potency of BMPs, thereby making them more clinically affordable for patients.

A variety of mini- and full-length dystrophin cassettes can prevent the development of most or all dystrophic symptoms in mdx mice, a model for DMD. These cassettes can be delivered efficiently to adult mdx mouse muscles using several viral vectors, including gutted adenovirus (Ad) or adeno-associated virus (AAV), resulting in a reversal of many dystrophic features. Nonetheless, a major rate limiting step for DMD gene therapy is the ability to target muscles throughout the body. Considerable interest has developed in the use of stem cells, such as hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells, to contribute
systemically to the repair of muscle tissue. However, transplantation of normal donor cells into a patient entails substantial risks of immune rejection and graft vs. host disease. Performing autologous stem cell transplantation after transduction with an integrating dystrophin expression vector could ameliorate this risk. We propose to develop a variety of lentiviral vectors and explore their ability to transduce bone marrow cells and myogenic precursors. Lentiviral vectors have a 9 kb cloning capacity and can hold both micro- and mini-dystrophins, together with muscle-specific promoters. Lentiviral vectors also integrate into the host cell genome leading to permanent expression for the lifetime of the targeted cell. We will test and compare the
ability of these vectors to transduce stem cells and muscle precursors, and to deliver functional dystrophin to muscle following either ex vivo or in vivo gene transfer. We will also explore gene transfer methods to stimulate conversion of non-muscle cells to myogenic stem cells and/or satellite cells, and to drive expansion of myogenic precursors in muscle tissue. Together, these studies will increase the prospects of using stem cell technologies for DMD gene therapy. If successful, these methods could be applied to many different types of muscular dystrophy."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Emerging evidence indicates that bone marrow derived cells (BMDC) can participate in renal repair. The current consensus finding is that donor BM derived renal epithelial cells appear at low frequency. On the other hand, there are other sources of stem cells that may contribute effectively in renal regeneration, e.g., the renal papilla is considered the niche for renal resident stem cells, metanephric mesenchyme contains embryonic renal stem cells and resident renal tubular epithelial cells can participate in tubular repair after acute injury. Based on these data, this proposal hypothesized that (a), dramatic reduction or complete ablation of podocytes will enhance BMDC becoming podocytes; (b). metanephric mesenchyme can participate in nephron regeneration after transplantation into recipients with acute glomerular injury and (c). renal resident cells may participate in podocyte regeneration. The long-term objective of this proposal and beyond is to optimize conditions to improve podocyte repair/regeneration by stem cells to prevent or attenuate the progression of acute or chronic glomerular disease into end stage renal disease (ESRD). The immediate goal of this proposed work is to establish new mouse models with inducible, modifiable glomerular injuries to serve as model system to study plasticity of stem cells, compare the efficiency and capacity of different sources of (stem) cells in renal repair. The proposed project will shed fresh lights on the robustness of plasticity of different stem cells in renal repair under proposed experimental settings.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-standing association of chronic inflammation with cancer has led to the discovery that inflammatory mediators such as interleukins can promote tumor growth. These inflammatory mediators are generally conceived as having a primary role inflammation and their effects on tumor cell growth has generally been considered a non-specific growth effect. However, we present evidence that inflammatory mediators actually exert a previously unrecognized role in promoting epithelial growth during normal prostate development. Our preliminary data show robust expression of inflammatory mediators in the developing prostate in the absence of cellular inflammation and demonstrate that these inflammatory mediators promote epithelial growth and a selective expansion of p63+ epithelial cells. We will also show that mice deficient in interleukin-1 receptor exhibit significantly disrupted prostate development and hyperplastic response to inflammation. These observations lead us to propose the provocative thesis that the effects of inflammatory mediators on epithelial proliferation in chronic inflammation and cancer are a re-iteration of their actions during normal development. We propose two specific aims to address the specific hypothesis that IL-1R mediated signaling stimulates proliferation of epithelial progenitor cells and mesenchyme in the developing prostate. Aim 1: Characterize the expression and actions of IL-1 ligands during prostate development. Studies will be performed both in vivo and in vitro using pharmacologic manipulation to determine the role of these inflammatory mediators in promoting epithelial proliferation and expansion of progenitor cells during prostate development. Aim 2: Characterize the effect of IL-1R LOF on prostate development. We will test the biologic relevance IL-1R in prostate growth by examining the effect of genetic disruption of IL1-R1 on prostate development, epithelial and mesenchymal proliferation, and progenitor cell expansion. We expect these studies to show that so-called inflammatory mediators actually play a central role in regulating progenitor cell proliferation. If correct, this would suggest that expression of inflammatory mediators by leukocytes recruited to a site of injury promotes epithelial progenitor cell proliferation as part of the regenerative repair process. These studies have the potential to revolutionize the understanding of cytokine action in the prostate, provide insights into the mechanisms by which chronic inflammation produces hyperplasia and dysplasia, and provide the scientific basis for therapeutic interventions to forestall progression to neoplasia.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The alveolar epithelium is comprised of 2 morphologically distinct differentiated epithelial cells, type I (TI) and type II (TII) cells, both of which are thought to be critical for normal lung function. Although the establishment, maintenance, and repair of a normal alveolar epithelium are essential for mammalian life, we have a limited understanding of the important processes that regulate these events. The broad objectives of the research are to understand how alveolar epithelial maintenance and repair are regulated. Within this context, the overall goals of this project are to elucidate the fates of TI and Tll cells and the cellular mechanisms responsible for the transdifferentiation of both cell types following lung injury. Studies performed 30 years ago using techniques of autoradiography and electron microscopy generated the current paradigm that after lung injury TII cells proliferate and transdifferentiate into TI cells. Based on studies in the literature and work presented in the Progress Report and Preliminary Data, the current paradigm appears now to be incomplete. There are reports in the published literature that TI cells may have reparative potential, and there has been recent speculation that epithelial-mesenchymal transformation may occur in the lung, in a similar fashion to the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. Immunohistochemical data presented in this application provide additional evidence that transdifferentiation occurs between the mesenchymal and epithelial compartments. Recently, we found that TI cells proliferate in vitro, supporting the concept that TI cells may also participate in the repair process in vivo. These observations have prompted us to generate the working hypothesis that repair following lung injury is more complex than a simple linear progression from mature TII to TI cells, involving other cellular processes such as transdifferentiation among TI cells, TII cells, and mesenchymal cells, and the proliferation of TI cells. The proposed studies comprise 3 specific aims to determine the extent to which TI and TII cells exhibit plasticity of expression and to elucidate the mechanisms for transdifferentiation. 1) To determine the fates of TI and TII cells following injury by fate-mapping studies in transgenic mice; 2) To ascertain at various time points in lung injury the molecular phenotypes and proliferative properties of various populations of alveolar epithelial cells, including ""intermediate cells,"" transitional cells expressing markers of both TI and TII cell phenotypes; and 3) To evaluate candidate regulatory genes by Q-PCR, by in situ hybridization, and by functional studies in vitro and in vivo.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several converging lines of evidence implicate Notch signaling as important in colorectal carcinogenesis and that increased Notch signaling occurs in the context of upregulated Wnt/?-catenin/TCF signaling, although its roles and impact on tumor phenotype are incompletely understood. We have developed evidence for increased Notch expression, and downstream target genes including hes and hey as well as four jointed box-1 (FJX1) and others in human colorectal cancers as compared with adenomas and with normal colon mucosa from gene expression arrays of human colorectal cancers. We have also developed evidence that shifting colon cancer cells from the mesenchymal phenotype to the more epithelial phenotype through restoration of the tumor suppressor, Smad4, in colon cancer cells is accompanied by downregulation of FJX1 a downstream target of Notch, thus suggesting that Smad4 expression may disrupt Notch signaling. Taken together, our preliminary findings suggest that interactions between Notch and TGF-?/BMP/Smad signaling have marked effects on determining colon cancer cell phenotype in a potentially regulated manner. In addition, we have found that inhibition of COX-2 activity with celecoxib in a clinical trial resulted in decreased mRNA expression of the Notch target, FJX1. Since COX-2 activity and its products such as PGE2 and other prostaglandins play important roles in cancer cell survival, invasion and angiogenesis, this may link Notch signaling to these important biological processes and to tumor progression. Central Hypothesis: Dysregulation of Notch signaling and overexpression of the Notch target gene, fjx1, contribute to colorectal carcinoma progression. Based on preliminary results, we further we hypothesize that Notch signaling in colorectal cancer is modulated by TGF- ?/BMP/Smad4 and Wnt signaling and that COX-2 enzyme activity enhances fjx1 expression and Notch activity. The following specific aims are designed to test the hypotheses: 1. To determine whether increased FJX1 expression is directly related to increased Notch signaling and determine the role of Notch signaling and FJX1 expression on colon cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and metastasis. 2. To determine the effect of Wnt, TGF-?/BMP signaling and COX-2 activity on the level of Notch activity and FJX1 expression in colorectal cancer. 3. To determine the impact of upregulated Notch signaling and FJX1 expression on colorectal tumors in vivo. A long-term goal of this project is to exploit a better understanding of the roles of Notch signaling and FJX1 expression and their interactions with other pathways in colorectal cancer to identify novel therapeutic interventions for this lethal disease.

We have demonstrated that Tbx5 plays a critical role in chick proepicardial cell migration during embryonic establishment of the epicardium and coronary vasculature. In human embryonic tissue, TBX5 expression is high in the epicardium and coronary vascular wall but is inactivated in the subepicardial cells delaminating from the epicardium to form coronary vessels. Preliminary data also suggest that Tbx5 activity in the proepicardium upregulates expression of the Ets-2, a transcription factor that has also been implicated in coronary vasculogenesis. We then hypothesize that Tbx5-dependent transcriptional circuits involving Ets-2 play critical roles in proepicardial, epicardial and coronary vessel development during embryogenesis. Furthermore, because we have shown that Tbx5 activities is re-expressed in adult human and murine bone-marrow derived stem cells differentiating into angioblasts, we hypothesize that Tbx5 can modify adult endothelial precursor cell differentiation, potentially via Ets-2 activation, and may thereby participate in cell mediated revascularization of the adult ischemic heart. In this application, we propose to utilize chick and mouse experimental models: (1) To determine the contributions of Tbx5 to establishment of the eppicardium and coronary vessels; (2) To define the impact of Tbx5 on Ets-2 expression in the proepicardial derivatives and the contribution of Ets-2 to Tbx5 signaling during epicardial development and coronary vasculogenesis; (3) To determine the role of Tbx5 expression during angioblastic differentiation of adult mammalian bone marrow derived stem cells. These studies will highlight critical transcriptional regulators of coronary vascular progenitor cell behavior and will both shed light on fundamental mechanisms that underlie the development of the coronary vasculature as well as foster novel targets to promote the revascularization of cardiac tissue in individuals with ischemic cardiomyopathies.","398236",

can have a significant impact on tumor progression. Host-derived cells are actively recruited into the tumor
microenvironment by a large variety of chemokines and growth factors expressed by tumor cells, either from
neighboring tissues or from the bone marrow. Vice versa, the bone marrow actively recruits tumor cells and
provides a unique environment where through osteoblast and osteoclast activation, tumor cells establish bone
metastasis. Over the last four years of funding through this grant we have demonstrated that neuroblastoma cells
recruit bone marrow-derived cells as a source of endothelial precursor cells (EPC) and matrix metalloproteinase-9
(MMP-9) expressing CD45 positive inflammatory cells, and that MMP-9 plays a critical role in the establishment of a
mature vasculature by promoting endothelial cell coverage with pericytes. We have also obtained evidence that
neuroblastoma cells, which lack the ability to express osteoclast activating factors, can stimulate the expression of
interleukin-6 (IL-6), an activator of osteoclasts, by bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC). On the basis
of these observations, we hypothesize that bone marrow-derived cells positively contribute to
neuroblastoma tumor progression by two specific mechanisms, first by being a source of EPC and
inflammatory cells that contribute to the establishment of a mature vasculature in the primary tumor, and
second by being a source of IL-6 expressing BM-MSC and of osteoclasts, allowing malignant bone invasion.
Our two specific aims are: Aim #1: To examine the mechanisms by which neuroblastoma cells recruit bone marrowderived
cells, their role in vascular morphogenesis, and the consequences of a lack of pericyte coverage on vascular
permeability, drug delivery and clinical outcome. Aim #2: To examine the mechanisms by which BM-MSC are
stimulated by neuroblastoma cells to activate osteoclasts and trigger bone invasion, and to test therapies interfering
with this process. This project aimed at a fundamental understanding of the interactions between neuroblastoma
cells and bone marrow-derived cells will identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention based on these interactive
pathways."," ",

Dll4 is a cell-surface ligand of Notch that is selectively       expressed in the developing endothelium and is required for normal vascular development.       Post-natally, Dll4 is expressed in the angiogenic endothelium, particularly in the tumor       vasculature. We generated primary endothelial cells overexpressing Dll4 protein, and found       that Dll4 overexpression reduces endothelial cell proliferative and migratory responses       selectively in response to VEGF-A. We identified reduced VEGF receptor 2 and Npn-1 expression       in Dll4-overexpressing endothelial cells as responsible for defective responses to VEGF-A.       Consistent with Dll4 signaling through Notch, expression of the transcription factor HEY2 was       significantly induced in Dll4-overexpressing endothelial cells, and a gamma secretase       inhibitor significantly reconstituted endothelial cell proliferation inhibited by Dll4. Thus,       these studies have identified the Notch ligand Dll4 as a selective inhibitor of VEGF-A       biologic activities down-regulating the principal VEGF-A signaling receptor, VEGFR-2 and       co-receptor Npn-1. In additional experiments utilizing pre-clinical cancer models, we have       explored the possibility of utilizing Dll4 as an activator of Notch signaling in endothelial       cells to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth. In xenogeneic and syngeneic tumor models       established in mice, we have documented tha Dll4 can markedly reduce tumor angiogenesis and       tumor growth, particularly in tumors of lymphoid origin. Studies of the mechanisms for the       anti-tumor effects of Dll4 have shown that these are attributable at least in part, to Notch       activation in the tumor microenvironment and in the tumor vasculature resulting in reduced       VEGFR2 expression and reduced tumor blood perfusion. Current studies are focused in further       defining the role of Dll4 in reduced tumor neovascularization. 2) We have explored the role of       neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) as a receptor shared by heparin-binding forms of vascular endothelial       growth factor (VEGF) and class 3 semaphorins, protein families that regulate endothelial and       neuronal function, respectively. Previous studies have shown that ligand binding to Npn-1       dictates the choice of signal transduction; plexins tranduce semaphorin signaling and VEGF       receptors transduce VEGF signaling. We have now examined the mechanisms underlying Npn-1       binding to VEGF or Sema3A, and how the engagement of Npn-1 by Sema3A affects endothelial cell       function. We have identified Sema 3A as an inhibitor of endothelial cell adhesion, survival       and proliferation and formation of vascular-like structures. Furthermore, we have found that       Npn-1-binding forms of VEGF block all these activities of Sema3A. We found that VEGF-A can       compete with Sema3A for endothelial cell binding, and can promote Npn-1 internalization from       the cell surface. Biochemical analysis of VEGF-A binding to endothelial cells revealed that       Npn-1 internalization requires ligand bridging of Npn-1 and VEGF receptors. We also found that       Sema3A can promote Npn-1 internalization, but requires a significantly higher concentration       than VEGF-A. Thus, our results unveil an essential role for Npn-1 as a sensor and priority       setter for endothelial cell responses to conflicting signals. In additional studies, we have       explored the possibility of targeting Npn-1 for internalization as a tool to regulate       endothelial cell responses to VEGF. In so doing, we have identified a group of polysaccharides       and other hybrid molecules that can induce Npn-1 internalization and can thus serve as       inhibitors of angiogenesis. We have named these compounds ""internalization       inducers"". Currently, we are exploring a variety of internalization-inducing       compounds that could be useful as therapeutics to reduce angiogenesis. 3) We have studied how       ephrinB ligands and their EphB receptors orchestrate endothelial/pericyte assembly in       newly-formed vessels. EphrinB ligands are surface-bound; in addition to activating their       cognate EphB receptors, they can function as signaling molecules when engaged by the receptor       through ""reverse signaling"". Eph receptors are tyrosine kinases interacting with their       membrane-anchored ephrin ligands. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that signaling       by Eph B receptors in endothelial cells is critical to assembly into vascular structures. We       have now investigated the potential role of Eph/ephrin signaling in the regulation of       endothelial/pericytes assembly. A critical step in angiogenesis consists of the recruitment of       pericytes to the outer vessel wall, a process that stabilizes and fortifies vessels structure.       Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can differentiate into pericytes upon interaction with       endothelial cells. Using bone marrow-derived MSC, we have established that MSC interact with       endothelial cells during extracellular matrix-dependent tube formation in vitro and matrigel       angiogenesis assay in vivo, such that MSC establish contact with endothelial cells in a       time-dependent and spatially-constrained manner. P-ephrinB is activated in the course of       endothelial cell morphogenic processes leading to capillary network stabilization and new       vessel formation in vivo. This activation is inhibited by specific EphB peptide inhibitors and       by a soluble recombinant protein ephrinB2-Fc. In vivo experiments, in which MSC-GFP were       injected subcutaneously into immuno-compromised mice in the context of extracellular matrix,       show that P-ephrinB reverse signaling is present at those sites where endothelial cells/MSC       physically interact. These experiments establish a role for ephrinB reverse signaling in       endothelial/pericyte interactions, and suggest that ephrinB signaling is a potential       therapeutic target for modulation of physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis.","649371",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are requesting support to test the hypothesis that fetal cells, acquired physiologically through pregnancy, and retained in the adult human female following abortion, miscarriage, or delivery, encompass a novel population of cells that we have termed the ""Pregnancy-Associated Progenitor Cell (PAPC)."" To date, the controversy surrounding the plasticity of adult stem cells has virtually ignored the role of pregnancy in females. PAPCs, if shown to be true stem cells, would have the developmental advantages of being fetal in origin yet could be retrieved without ethical controversy from an adult female who has previously been pregnant. We have extensive preliminary data in the human adult, non-transfused female that fetal cells (identified on the basis of the Y chromosome as well as fetal-specific DNA polymorphisms), acquired through pregnancy, are detectable in peripheral blood and clinically diseased organs, and have multi-lineage capacity. Due to the necessity of obtaining clinical material from biopsy and/or autopsy specimens, these studies have been descriptive and not mechanistic. Our hypothesis will be tested in an animal model, a transgenic male mouse expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or luciferase bred to wild-type female mice. This will allow us to control reproductive histories, and test multiple hypotheses regarding the plasticity and activity of fetal cells in the maternal body. The GFP and luciferase sequences are dominant transgenes. Half of the fetal pups will carry the transgene, and express the green fluorescent marker in some or all of their cells, depending on the construct. Fetal cells fluoresce green and can be identified and tracked in maternal tissues using a variety of techniques, including in vivo whole animal imaging, fluorescence microscopy, and real-time PCR amplification. In specific aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that specific factors affect the development of fetal cell microchimerism (FCMC) in the mother. In specific aim 2 we will use chemical, surgical, genetic, and ischemic models to determine if fetal cells are recruited in specific tissue injury scenarios and contribute to the repair of maternal injury by analyzing overall well being and longevity, target organ function, differences in wound healing, and differential gene expression. In specific aim 3 we will examine the cell surface characteristics of the murine microchimeric fetal cells and perform microarray analysis to determine whether FCMC is due to 1 or multiple cell types. In specific aim 4 we will test the hypothesis that fetal stem cells have an advantage over adult stem cells and contribute to prolonged survival or improved organ function. The long-term objective is to determine if pregnancy confers a long-term advantage to a female by resulting in the acquisition of unique cells that have therapeutic potential.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Cell transplantation shows potential promise for treating ischemic heart disease.  Several elegant studies have demonstrated that implantation of skeletal myoblasts and bone marrow stem cells into the scarred myocardium can result in improved function.  However, longitudinal analysis of cell survival remains problematic, because the current methodology relies on postmortem histology.  Recently, we have established the feasibility of monitoring transplanted embryonic cardiomyoblasts expressing reporter genes in living animals using optical bioluminescence charged coupled device (CCD) and micro positron emission tomography (microPET) imaging.  The specific aims of this proposal are well- thought-out extensions of our initial findings.   
  
This proposal will test the following multi-leveled hypothesis.  In Aim 1, we will continue to develop an in vivo imaging model for monitoring the location, magnitude, and survival duration of transplanted human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).  Equally important, cell survival will be correlated with changes in contractility, perfusion, and metabolism, as determined by echocardiography, [13N]-NH3, and [18F]-FDG imaging, respectively.  In Aim 2, imaging results will be validated with traditional ex vivo and in vitro assays, such as morphometric analysis, immunocytochemistry, TaqMan PCR, TUNEL apoptosis stain, Westerns, and enzyme assays.  Afterwards, we will focus on more fundamental questions related to stem cell physiology.  In particular, Aim 3 will evaluate the optimal cell type, cell dosage, delivery route, timing of transplant, and efficacy of repeated injections.  Finally, we will examine the causes of early cell death post transplant in Aim 4, and then screen for pharmaceutical, gene, and cell-based therapies aimed at preventing cell death and apoptosis.  
  
The overall significance of this proposal is to understand the real-time physiologic state of transplanted cells in an intact whole-body system.  These studies will add further insights to the field of stem cell biology.  As PET imaging is readily transferable from small animals to humans, our findings should have direct clinical impact in the near future.  The goal is to use molecular imaging to guide stem cell therapy, which should translate into transplant protocols that are more reproducible, quantifiable, and beneficial.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are affected by permanent hearing deficits and balance dysfunctions that result from losses of sensory hair cells. In mammalian ears, when hair cells die they are not effectively replaced, but the case is quite different in non-mammalian vertebrates. In those species hair cell loss leads to cell proliferation and the subsequent differentiation of new replacement hair cells, which then become innervated. These regenerative events lead to structural healing of damaged ears and can restore hearing and balance a few weeks after non-mammalian vertebrates have experienced damage that would result in permanent deficits for humans. Research has shown that human and rodent ear tissues can activate important elements of the biological machinery that underlies regeneration, but the regenerative responses in mammalian ears are normally limited. The research proposed seeks knowledge that may provide the means to eventually overcome those limits. This request for renewal of a project in its 24th year proposes to continue investigations that focus on identifying and understanding the signaling mechanisms that control the production of cells and the processes that lead to their specialization as sensory hair cells in embryonic and postembryonic ears. The mechanisms that limit self-repair in the ears of mammals will be investigated and treatments that may overcome those limits will be tested. The information sought may identify targets for the development of therapeutic approaches to stimulate self-repair in the ears of mammals. In addition, this project will seek to scale up the in vitro production of hair cells from lines of passaged cells. The availability of specialized cells that are produced in vitro has provided the basis for many examples of significant gains in cancer cell biology, neurology, and other fields. These cell lines and the knowledge gained in their further development and utilization holds the potential for contributing to improved treatments for diseases of the ear. The goals of this research directly pertain to possible recovery from sensorineural hearing loss and balance dysfunctions that contribute to prevalent communication disorders and to falls by elderly individuals. They also are likely to lead to improved understanding of the development of normal and abnormal auditory and vestibular function in human ears. With the proposed investigations, we seek to contribute to better understanding of the cellular lineages and the cellular mechanisms that contribute to the development, regenerative replacement, and in vitro production of inner ear hair cells. Hair cell loss is the leading cause of permanent hearing impairment as well as a contributing cause of balance impairments that can lead to falls in older individuals. The knowledge we seek holds the potential to ultimately contribute to the development of treatments that may lead to partial or complete recovery from forms of hearing or balance impairment that are now permanent.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Snail superfamily genes encode zinc finger-containing DNA binding proteins that act as transcriptional repressors. This superfamily has two main branches: the Snail family (encoded by the Snai1, 2 and 3 genes) and the Scratch family (the Scrt1 and 2 genes). These proteins are key regulators of the epithelial- mesenchymal transition, and also play roles in cell proliferation, survival and movement. We have performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of the requirements for Snail superfamily genes during embryonic development in mice. Our work during the prior funding periods of this grant established the null phenotype of all of these genes, and demonstrated that the most severe embryonic phenotype is observed in Snai1 mutants. However, many questions remain about the requirements and roles of Snail superfamily genes. In this proposal, both molecular and genetic approaches will be utilized to analyze the roles played by Snail family genes during embryogenesis in mice, and to understand the mechanisms causing the mutant phenotypes. The mutant mouse strains we have already generated, as well as the mutant strains we will construct as part of this proposal, constitute a unique set of reagents that will permit us to finely dissect the roles of Snail family genes during embryonic development. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) determine targets for transcriptional repression by the SNAI1 protein during early embryogenesis in mice; 2) test the hypothesis that post- translational regulation of SNAI1 protein by the GSK3beta kinase and the betaTrcp ubiquitin ligase are essential for Snai1 function in vivo; 3) test the hypothesis that Snail family genes are important for muscle development, physiology and regeneration by determining the individual roles of the Snai1, Snai2 and Snai3 genes in these processes; 4) assess Snai3 redundancy with Snai2 and Snai1 function during muscle development, physiology and regeneration.   
  
Public Health Relevance: The long-term goal of this proposal is to understand the roles that Snail superfamily genes play during embryonic development in mammals. Snail superfamily genes encode zinc finger-containing DNA binding proteins that act as transcriptional repressors. The studies described in this proposal will further our understanding of the roles played by Snail superfamily genes during mammalian development, and will be relevant to the study of both normal and abnormal human development.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Aging is associated with an increase in bone marrow adipocytes and a relative deficit in osteoblasts. Thus, it has been proposed that with senescence, there is a shunting of the common marrow precursor cell away from the osteoblast and towards the adipocyte lineage.   Since the increase in marrow adipocytes and relative deficit in bone formation occurs in both women and men, and men were not felt to become sex steroid deficient with aging, it was generally believed that the increase in bone marrow adipocytes with age was independent of sex steroids. However, considerable work by us and others has established that while men do not have the equivalent of a menopause, elderly men do develop significant decreases in bioavailable (or non-sex hormone binding globulin-bound) testosterone and estrogen (E) levels.   Moreover, these declining sex steroid and, in particular, declining bioavailable E levels correlate with bone loss in men. The evidence for decreases in bioavailable E levels with aging in both women and men (albeit through different mechanisms) thus provides the conceptual framework for our central hypothesis that E deficiency leads to increased shunting of bone marrow stromal cells towards the adipocyte lineage at the expense of the osteoblast lineage. We will test our hypothesis using basic, in vitro mechanistic studies as well as in vivo mouse and human models within the context of our three Specific Aims:  Aim 1: Use the bipotential mouse bone marrow stromal cell line, ST2, as well as mouse bone marrow mesenchymal cell cultures to examine the molecular mechanisms by which E inhibits adipogenesis and enhances osteoblast development;  Aim 2: Use aging mice to define the relative contributions of aging vs. E deficiency towards the observed age- related increase in bone marrow adipogenesis. As part of these studies, use the findings from Aim 1 to select the target genes to be evaluated in vivo for changes with age and for modulation of these changes by E; and Aim 3: Assess, in postmenopausal women, the relative contributions of aging vs. E deficiency towards the increased bone marrow adipogenesis seen in these women, as well as the potential underlying mechanisms for this. Collectively, the proposed studies address key questions posed by RFA-AG-06-003 (""The Adipogenic Phenotype in Aging Musculoskeletal Tissues""), as they focus on the mechanisms that control differentiation of mesencymal stem cells down the osteoblastic or adipocytic lineages and test the plausible hypothesis that, like age-related bone loss, age-related bone marrow adipocyte accumulation is driven, at least in part, by declining bioavailable E levels. These studies are also of considerable clinical significance, since understanding the pathways used by E in limiting adipogenesis and enhancing osteoblast development could lead to new approaches to prevent the relative deficit in osteoblasts with aging, which would have significant implications for the prevention and treatment of age-related bone loss.

This signaling pathway is crucial to the ontogeny of the bony and membranous labyrinths. However, the specific roles that BMP signaling plays in the chondrogenesis of the temporal bone, and in the formation of the semicircular canals and vestibular sensory epithelia are poorly understood. Thus, to better characterize the role of this pathway during inner ear ontogeny, we have developed several molecular genetic tools for analysis of BMP signaling during inner ear development. We will use Cre-mediated inactivation of type I BMP receptor genes to study BMP signaling during inner ear embryo genesis; employ transcriptional regulatory elements of the Brn4 gene to direct the expression of genes to the otic mesenchyme of transgenic mice; and exploit a pedigree of mice that mediates Cre-induced gene rearrangements in the otic mesenchyme to address the following specific aims:  
  
Aim #1. To characterize phospho-SMAD expression during inner ear development, we propose to undertake pan immunohistochemical analysis of phospho-SMAD localization to identify regions of active BMP signaling during inner ear development.   
  
Aim #2. To genetically test the role of BMP signaling during temporal bone formation, we will inactivate thepfunction of both BMP type I receptor genes, Bmprla and Bmprlb, in the otic mesenchyme. Functional analyses of these mutants will be assessed by recording auditory brain responses, endocochlear potential and middle ear transfer function with laser interferometer.   
  
Aim #3. To genetically test the role of BMP type I receptor genes during the ontogeny of sensory and nonsensorypepithelia, we will knockout these receptors in the otic vesicle.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The mechanisms that regulate repair of chronic liver injury are poorly understood. Mature hepatocytes proliferative capacity declines during chronic injury. To compensate for this, hepatic epithelial progenitor populations expand and differentiate to replace dying cells. Similar responses occur in the mesenchyme, enriching hepatic stellate cell (HSC) populations with proliferating myofibroblastic cells. Successful reconstruction of liver architecture occurs when mesenchymal-epithelial (M-E) interactions orchestrate balanced expansion and differentiation of both epithelial and mesenchymal cells. However, defective remodeling leads to disorganization of hepatic architecture, resulting in cirrhosis and neoplasia. M-E interactions that involve the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway modulate repair of some adult tissues. We recently discovered that healthy adult livers contain cells that are capable of both producing and responding to Hh ligands. Interestingly, this Hh-reactive population includes immature liver epithelial cells and hepatic stellate cells. Both cell types play important roles in liver repair, suggesting the following HYPOTHESIS: Hedgehog signaling-mediated mesenchymal-epithelial interactions regulate regeneration of adult livers. We found that injury-related factors, such as PDGF-BB, promote the outgrowth of myofibroblastic cells that produce Sonic hedgehog (Shh) to auto-regulate their viability. Liver injury also expands populations of immature bile ductular cells that produce Indian hedgehog (Ihh), while significantly reducing hepatic expression of the Hh inhibitor, Hip. This is accompanied by expansion of stromal and epithelial cell populations that express Hh-target genes, such as Ptc and/or Gli. Double immunofluorescence staining reveals that Ihh expression is relatively restricted to bile ductular cells, while both epithelial and stromal cells express Hh-target genes. Progenitor populations seem to be relatively enriched with Hh-responsive cells. As liver damage resolves, fibrosis, myofibroblastic cells, and epithelial progenitors regress and Hh-pathway activity gradually subsides. These data support our hypothesis and justify further efforts to delineate mechanisms that control Hh activity in adult livers and clarify the role of the Hh pathway in regulating how adult livers respond to injury. Thus, our Aims are to determine: 1) how the activation of HSC alters the production of- and response to- Hh ligands; 2) if the phenotype of different types of liver epithelial cells influences their response to HSC-derived Hh ligands, or their ability to elicit HSC production of Hh ligands; and 3) if modulating Hh signaling activity alters regeneration following liver injury. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Results from this work will extend current understanding about the complex homeostatic mechanisms that maintain and restore liver architecture in adults. Such knowledge is likely to impact upon liver disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment and thus, has important clinical implications.

Our overall, long-term goal is that the answers to these questions should help to hasten the development of
novel stem-cell based strategies for treating human diseases. We will pursue the following aims. First, we
will evaluate a range of antibodies directed against cytoplasmic intermediate filament (IF) proteins as
markers to help identify specific classes of progenitor cells in cultures of human embryonic stem cells
(hESC). We will use these antibodies to track the changing patterns of IF protein expression as cells
progress to terminal differentiation. Second, we will use small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to down regulate
specific IF proteins to help determine the functional significance of the different IF protein expression profiles
that emerge during development. Third, we will make a detailed study of the structure and function of nestin,
a type IV IF protein widely-used as a neural progenitor cell marker, focussing on our recent finding that its C
terminus interacts with the insulin degrading enzyme and may regulate its activity. The experiments will
make use of an extensive collection of mono- and polyclonal antibodies raised against cytoskeletal IF
proteins that we have developed and tested in our laboratory over the years. We will employ high resolution,
confocal fluorescence microscopy to study fixed, immunostained cells. Time lapse studies will be made of
living cells expressing various GFP-IF protein constructs and the dynamic properties of IF of varying protein
composition will be studied using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP).
Public health relevance of this research: Human embryonic stem cells have the potential to give rise to all
cell types of the human body, and thus have great utility for treating diseases such as Parkinsons' Disease
and diabetes, as well as spinal cord injuries. The proposed research will advance our understanding of the
cell biological events that take place as stem cells change into more highly differentiated cell types. This
information is crucial for guiding cells down the right pathway so that they can eventually be used to treat
patients."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The application's broad, long-term objectives are to determine how fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling is crucial for the patterning and interactions between developing renal lineages at early and later stages. The Specific Aims are: 1.To fully characterize the temporal and lineage specific expression patterns of fgfr1 and fgfr2 in the developing kidney. 2. To fully characterize the temporal and lineage specific patterning defects resulting from deleting fgfr1 and/or fgfr2 in the ureteric bud or the metanephric mesenchyme. 3. To determine the functional consequences of blocking FGFR1 and/or FGFR2 signaling in the kidney using a combination of in vitro and in vitro strategies. Elucidating the roles of FGFR signaling in kidney development may impact on a range of devastating congenital kidney disorders, which are the most frequent causes of end stage renal failure in children.   
The expression patterns of fgfr1 and fgfr2 in the kidney will be characterized at early and later stages of kidney development by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.  
The temporal and lineage-specific patterning defects resulting from conditional targeting of individual and combinations of fgfr1 and fgfr2 will be assessed first by examining histological markers for each of the lineages. Assays for abnormalities in apoptosis and/or proliferation will also be assessed in each of the conditional knockouts.  
The functional consequences of deleting the receptors will be addressed first by whether the fgfrs are truly functionally equivalent in the kidney, with a combination of in vitro and in vitro approaches. The mechanisms responsible for the phenotypic abnormalities described in Aim 2 will be investigated in each conditional knockout. Expression of other genes that control renal development will be assessed to place FGFR signaling in molecular pathways. In vitro explant approaches will be used to knockdown FGFR signaling to uncover additional developmental roles of the FGFRs in the kidney. Finally, complementary in vitro and in vitro assays will be performed to determine the FGFR downstream signaling pathways relevant to kidney development.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
E-cadherin is a calcium-dependent transmembrane molecule that mediates homophilic interactions that are critical in mediating cell adhesion. Disruption of E-cadherin function is a hallmark feature of esophageal cancer (a common cancer in the US and worldwide), and other epithelial cancers. This leads to the promotion of esophageal cancer cell migration and invasion. Our preliminary data reveal that overexpression of E-cadherin upregulates TGFb receptor II (TGFRII) and statistically significant coordinated loss of both in esophageal cancer tissues. We have used primary human esophageal epithelial cells to analyze the loss of E-cadherin by retrovirally introducing a dominant-negative mutant version of E-cadherin lacking the cytoplasmic tail resulting in augmented cell migration and invasion. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that there is functional interplay between E-cadherin and TGFRII in esophageal cancer cell migration, invasion and EMT. We will test our hypothesis by pursiung [sic] the following interrelated Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: A. To identify the domain(s) mediating the physical interaction between E-cadherin and TGFRII. We will generate deletion mutants of TGFRII and E-cadherin and map the specific domains necessary for interaction in vitro and in vivo. B. To analyze the mechanistic effects on cell migration and invasion mediated by the TGFRII / E- cadherin interaction. We will use the above mentioned mutants and a dominant-negative mutant of TGFRII to test how the normal interaction and loss of interaction influences cell migration, invasion and EMT. Specific Aim 2: To determine how E-cadherin stabilizes TGFRII and regulates its degradation and function. We will analyze the effects of E-cadherin on TGFRII expression and determine the kinetics of TGFRII degradation by analyzing TGFRII association with the endosome or proteasome machinery. Specific Aim 3: To analyze the effects of loss of E-cadherin function in vivo using mouse models. We will use mouse models to investigate the loss of E-cadherin in the esophagus and how this pertains to the regulation of TGFRII function and the induction of tumorigenesis. In addition, new mouse models will be established using dominant-negative E-cadherin to directly model and recapitulate our in vitro findings. In aggregate, these studies will provide insights into the importance of E-cadherin and TGFRII to mediate esophageal cancer cell migration and invasion, hopefully translating into novel approaches for therapeutics.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
  
The objective of this project is to determine the role of laminin a5 in lung alveogenesis.  Laminin a5, a component of basement membrane, has been shown to be important for lung lobar septation and formation of a visceral pleural basement membrane in early lung development using the laminin a5 null mouse.  Because the laminin a5 null mouse has embryonic death, the role of laminin a5 in the latter stages of lung development, including alveolization, cannot be assessed.  Using an allograft implant model, the laminin a5 null lung has abnormal development of the pre-alveolar saccules, hinting at abnormal alveolization.  The specific aims of this project are to determine the effect of lack of laminin a5 on alveolization during lung development and in alveolization in the adult lung using the post-pneumonectomy model.  This will be achieved through generation and study of an inducible, lung-specific laminin a5 null mouse using the Tet-Cre system.  In addition to characterization of alveolization during development and alveolization in adult lungs, domains of laminin a5 important for alveolization will also be identified using in vitro studies with alveolar epithelial cells from lung-specific laminin a5 null mice and peptides of domains of laminin a5.  These studies will be of value in understanding and controlling the mechanisms behind lung growth.  
  
Implementation of these studies will provide the investigator with training from which an independent career in academic medicine can be constructed.  The investigator will be supervised by Robert Senior, a leader in the study of lung biology, and Jeffrey Miner, a leader in basement membrane and laminin biology.  The training will be enhanced by collaboration with Richard Pierce, who is an expert in the study of post-pneumonectomy lung growth.  In addition, an advisory committee of highly regarded medical scientists will provide scientific and career advice.  The research will be completed at Washington University, a world-renowned institution for medical and scientific research which will allow access to top scientists and the latest technologies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
Spatial concentration gradients of endogenous soluble growth factors play critical roles directing cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation during development, homeostasis, and wound healing. This grant application addresses the question: Could an exogenous solid-phase growth factor immobilized in specified directional gradients within an engineered biomimetic extracellular matrix (bECM) be an effective approach to recruit and guide surrounding host cells into a bECM and promote a desired biological outcome? The goal is to determine if this growth factor delivery paradigm would be relevant for future therapy development in tissue engineering applications. The paradigm in vitro models will include human microvascular endothelial cell, MG-63 human preosteoblastic cell, and human adult mesenchymal stem cell responses to solid-phase human fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) in fibrin bECMs. The in vivo model will be a chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay to assess directed angiogenic response within fibrin bECM/FGF-2 structures placed on the CAM. The research will systematically progress from two-dimensional patterns of FGF-2 on fibrin films to three-dimensional (3D) patterns of FGF-2 within fibrin bECMs, and from isolated cell responses in vitro to angiogenic responses in vivo. The overall hypotheses are spatial gradients of solid phase FGF-2 in a fibrin bECM will direct cell migration in vitro in register with gradient directionality, and cell migrational flux will be greater in response to gradient patterns than patterns with uniform distributions. And in vivo, a directed angiogenic response will be greater in designs with gradients in comparison with uniform distributions. The bECM/FGF-2 structures will be fabricated with a solid freeform fabrication printing process that produces specified 3D spatial patterns of growth factors within 3D fibrin bECMs. Fluorescent based quantum dot imaging technology and fluorescence optical sectioning microscopy will be used to validate printed structures and assess cell and CAM responses. The research will be carried out by multidisciplinary bioengineering with expertise in endocrinology, advanced manufacturing, and biophysical imaging.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The esophageal epithelium is an exquisitely regulated epithelium with equilibrium between proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. As a prototype stratified squamous epithelium, it is a vehicle to understand normal homeostasis, regenerative biology and malignant transformation. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most aggressive forms of human squamous cell cancers. ESCC tumors often have a dense accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins within them, a phenomenon known as desmoplasia. While alterations in critical oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are common to squamous cell cancers, the extent of desmoplasia may serve as a distinguishing feature. The transformed epithelial compartment and the mesenchymal compartment consisting of stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells, myocytes and other cell types constitute the microenvironment of the tumor. Signals from tumor cells activate a dynamic process of ECM remodeling that creates an environment conducive for tumor growth. Specialized tumor activated fibroblasts (TAP) have been identified to mediate this remodeling process and promote tumor progression. Using an in vivo-like organotypic 3D cell culture system, we are able to recapitulate classic features of ESCC. This work has led us to hypothesize that activated fibroblasts surrounding the tumor cells help create an environment primed for tumor growth and invasion via the secretion of paracrine growth factors. The interrelated Specific Aims to test this hypothesis and to determine the molecular mechanism(s) by which mesenchymal stromal fibroblasts promote tumor growth and invasion are as follows: (1) To characterize the importance of activated mesenchymal stromal fibroblasts in promoting esophageal cell tumorigenicity. (2): To identify the molecular mechanism(s) by which activated mesenchymal stromal fibroblasts increase the invasive potential of transformed esophageal cells into the surrounding tumor microenvironment. These studies will be done in 3D culture systems and animal models using molecular and cellular biological approaches. In aggregate, our studies will provide new insights into how tumor activated fibroblasts influence squamous cell tumorigenesis, using esophageal cancers as a paradigm, and these findings may unravel innovative combinatorial therapies for treating esophageal cancer through the targeting of both transformed epithelial and mesenchymal stromal cells.

This is very important since failure of these processes has been shown to lead to cleft palate, one of the most common birth defects in humans. Others and we have previously shown that during palatal fusion transforming growth factor-betas (Tgf-betas) induce several downstream responses that contribute to the successful palatogenesis. This proposal focuses on the role of epithelial and mesenchymal Tgf-beta signals in coordination of palatal fusion. Our overall hypothesis is: Tgf-beta/Bmp signaling events both in the palatal mesenchyme and in the epithelium are critical for successful palatal fusion and play a concerted role during palatogenesis. We propose to test this hypothesis by five Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we propose to determine the effect of neural crest cell specific abrogation of the Tgf-b type I receptor AIk2 on palatal development. In Aim 2, we propose to define the role of Tgf-beta type I receptors AIk2 and AIk5 in the palatal midline epithelium during palatal fusion, in Aim 3 we propose to determine the role of reciprocal epithelio-mesenchymal Tgf-beta signaling during palatal fusion, in Aim 4 we propose to analyze why direct contact between the palatal epithelium and mesenchyme can bypass the Tgf-beta3 signaling defect, and finally in Aim 5 we propose to determine the role of gap junctions in Tgf-beta-induced palatal midline epithelial fusion.   
  
Our unique experimental models and the state-of-art strategy allow us to determine the role Tgf-beta signaling via AIk5 and AIk2 in palatogenesis. Collectively, the proposed experiments are likely to be of critical importance in attempting to understand the molecular bases of facial and palatal cleftings in humans, and to develop possible therapeutic approaches to treat cleft palate during the fetal period.","212660",

protein in the Wnt pathway, p-catenin is regulated by the ARC tumor suppressor protein, and mutations in both
p-catenin and E-cadherin are implicated in many forms of cancer. The two overall objectives of the project are
to determine the mechanism underlying the cytoplasmic regulation of p-catenin signaling, and to determine
how cadherins affect p-catenin signaling, cell differentiation, and tumor cell growth.
 Nuclear import of p-catenin is important for signaling and occurs by a novel mechanism involving its
interaction with the nuclear pore. The mechanism of p-catenin nuclear pore docking and its regulation by the
Wnt signaling pathway will be studied, p-catenin signaling is regulated by a very large protein complex that
includes ARC, axin, and the kinase GSKSp. The properties of the intact complex will be studied using an in
vitro p-catenin signaling assay, phosphorylation assays, and analyses of p-catenin interactions. The complex
will also be purified in order to identify key protein components. Furthermore, the role of a recently identified
second ARC protein, APC-2, in p-catenin signaling in the early Xenopus embryo will be evaluated.
 Cadherin expression antagonizes p-catenin signaling by binding it up at the plasma membrane, providing a
potential mechanism to couple changes in cell adhesion to regulation of gene expression. The possibility that
cadherin regulation of p-catenin signaling plays an important role in development of the neural crest in the
Xenopus embryo, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, will be explored. Similarly, experiments will be done to
determine the relative contributions of regulating P-cateninsignaling or enhancing cell adhesion to the tumor
suppressor function of E-cadherin. Experiments will also be performed to determine whether E-cadherin can
directly generate signals that mediate contact inhibition of cell growth.
 These experiments should help us understand the mechanisms of p-catenin-mediated signaling and
provide insights into the relationships between cell adhesion, tissue morphogenesis, and tumor growth.","521940",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project addresses signaling processes during formation of the aorta and pulmonary trunk, and then in the maturation and maintenance of these vessels. A greater understanding of these processes might lead to diagnostic or therapeutic opportunities for malformations that occur when these processes go awry. We have undertaken neural crest-specific disruption of the type II TGFb receptor gene (Tgfbr2) in mice, to address the role of TGFb signaling in the formation and maturation of the outflow tract vessels of the developing heart. Mutant embryos have persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA) and interrupted aortic arch (IAA- B); later in gestation, the elastic matrix of the neural crest-derived vessel wall of the ductus arteriosus becomes disorganized, leading to vessel wall dilation (aneurysm). The central premise to explain these defects is that the behavior of neural crest cells is dictated by local signaling events, that neural crest cells respond directly to these signals, and that TGFb is one such signal. Specific Aim 1: To identify mechanisms by which absence of TGFb signaling in neural crest cells results in PTA. In this Aim, we will identify and characterize the role of genes that are misregulated in neural crest- derived smooth muscle cells; we will also address the requirement for Smad-dependent signaling pathways downstream of the TGFb receptor. Specific Aim 2: To address the role of retinoic acid and RA receptors in the formation of the A/P septum, and the potential convergence of this pathway with TGFb signaling pathways. Mutation of retinoic acid receptor genes leads to a virtually identical PTA defect as in Tgfbr2 mutants. We will define the tissue in which retinoic acid signaling occurs, and address the convergence of RA and TGFb signaling pathways in the process of outflow tract septation. Specific Aim 3: To address the role of TGFb signaling in vessel wall maturation. In this Aim, we will study the onset of vascular wall deformation, address the extent to which TGFb signal transduction is required in mesodermally-derived vs. neural crest-derived smooth muscle and resolve whether vessel dilation results directly or indirectly from a mechanically impaired vessel wall.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three genes (GJB2, GJB3, GJB6) encode for gap junction proteins (connexin 26 (Cx26), (Cx30) and (Cx31) respectively), are found to cause dominant and/or recessive hearing loss. How these mutations cause hearing loss remains unknown. While both recessive and dominant mutants have impaired function, the dominant mutants might have additional dominant negative effects on the wild type counterparts or even trans-dominant inhibition effects on each other, as Cx26, Cx30 and Cx31 are all expressed in the cochlea. The loss of gap junction coupling in cochlear cells may affect the homeostasis of potassium ions in the inner ear and cause hearing impairment. To test these hypotheses, cellular and animal models will be generated to analyze the effects of dominant GJB2/Cx26, GJB6/Cx30, and GJB3/Cx31 mutations, with the following three Specific Aims: 1) to determine the effects of dominant GJB2/Cx26, GJB6/Cx30, and GJB3/Cx31 mutations on the assembly, trafficking and function of their cognate mutant protein in gap junction-deficient HeLa cells; 2) to determine the effects of dominant GJB2/Cx26, GJB6/Cx30, and GJB3/Cx31 mutations on HeLa cells that express wild-type human Cx26, Cx30 and Cx31; 3) to generate and analyze animal models of selected dominant GJB2/Cx26 mutations, by expressing these mutants in the mesenchymal cells of the cochlea. The trafficking and functional results of the cellular and animal models will elucidate the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanism of dominant GJB2/Cx26, GJB6/Cx30, and GJB3/Cx31 mutations, and the animal models of selected mutations will serve as a fundamental resource for further study of the causes and treatments of these inherited causes of deafness. The principle investigator proposed this five year supervised research experience and didactic training to serve as a transitional period from a clinician to a clinician scientist. Dr. Scherer, who has performed similar analyses on the effects of GJB1/Cx32 mutations, will mentor her scientific development, along with Dr. Crenshaw, an established investigator in neurobiology and auditory biology. The work will be supported by the collaboration of Dr. Saunders, an established investigator in the neurobiology and physiology of hearing. An external advisory committee of highly regarded expert in connexin and auditory biology will provide additional support and advice. My goal is to become a well trained independent investigator in biomedicine. The excellent academic environment and the tremendous resource at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as the commitment of her institute will maximize her potential to succeed.

Dr. Anthony Gerber is a pulmonary and critical care physician with a well-defined interest in developmental biology that was fostered as a member of the medical scientist training program at the University of Washington.  His overall career objective is to combine his clinical and basic science interests through studying the relationship between developmental pathways and lung disease in an academic medical center.  This proposal is constructed to provide the framework to achieve that goal.  Through a series of specific aims, Dr. Gerber will test several hypotheses regarding the role of the hedgehog (Hh) pathway, a critical developmental control network, in the lung.   Specifically, he will explore the effects of transgenic misexpression of the Hh regulated transcription factor, Gli1, in the lung epithelium and mesenchyme.  This will test the hyopthesis that Gli1 regulates patterning, proliferation, and differentiation in the developing lung.  The hypothesis that the effects of Hh signaling in the lung vary depending on timing will be tested using temporal regulation of Gli1 mis-expression.  Microarrays will also be used to identify targets of Hh signaling in the lung to test the hyopthesis that distinct subsets of genes respond to the Hh signal at different times; ultimately the effects of Gli1 on gene activation and lung injury will be assessed using mouse and cell culture models.  The relevance of the proposed work to lung disease is based on the general notion that developmental pathways are activated in disease, coupled with specific recent observations that the Hh pathway is activated in response to lung injury and is expressed in lung cancer and pulmonary fibrosis.  Additionally, this proposal is designed to complement Dr. Gerber's prior laboratory experience and provide him with the requisite technical and intellectual background in lung development to function as an independent investigator.  A committee of physicians and scientists will oversee Dr. Gerber's progression towards independence; his scientific development will also be enriched through attendance at several seminar series at UCSF, departmental retreats, and national meetings.  UCSF is committed to the development of careers in academic medicine, and at the end of the grant period, Dr. Gerber will be prepared to embark on a career as an independent physician scientist investigating developmental pathways that are active in lung disease.","121770",

However, definitive downstream mediators of Cbfa1 that critically impact osteoblast differentiation and bone formation have yet to be described.  Ne1 (a protein strongly expressed in neural tissue encoding epidermal growth factor like domain) was first identified in chicken embryos. The preliminary data shows that Nell-1 (Ne1-like molecule-1) in vivo is associated with normal and pathological suture fusion, while Nell- 1 in vitro is associated with increased osteoblast differentiation and mineralization. Furthermore, the human Nell-1 promoter contains three osteoblast-specific cis-acting element 2 (OSE2) response elements for Cbfa1 and that Nell-1 overexpression mice can functionally compensate for some aspects of intramembranous bone deficiency in heterozygous Cbfa1 deficient mice. These data have led to the hypothesis that Nell-1 is a central downstream target of Cbfa1 that supports continued differentiation and function in committed osteoblasts and proper Nell-1 expression is required for normal membranous bone growth and formation. To test this hypothesis, this proposal will analyze the following: 1) the regulation of Nell-1 transcription by Cbfa1 during osteoblast formation and function and by Cbfa1 through OSE2 response elements; 2) the functional compensation of Cbfa1 deficiency by Nell-1 in vivo and in vitro; and 3) the effects of targeted Nell-1 disruption in vivo.   
  
If Nell-1 is proven to be a critical mediator of intramembranous bone formation, it can further aid in understanding the development of intramembranous vs. endochondral bone. In addition, since sutures are major sites of calvarial intramembranous bone growth the close association of Nell-1 with calvarial sutures can also impact present knowledge on cranial vault development. Lastly, Nell-1 can be tremendously useful as a clinical tool to inhibit or induce intramembranous bone growth, with the secretory nature of Nell-1 making this utility even more feasible. Controlled inhibition of intramembranous bone growth by anti-Nell-1 strategies in CS patients may offer a less invasive, biologically based, therapeutic alternative to radical surgical craniofacial reconstruction. In addition, the ability of Nell- 1 to induce calvarial osteoblast differentiation may be clinically applied to situations where membranous bone formation and regeneration are desirable (e.g., cleft lip or cleft palate repair and craniofacial distraction osteogenesis).","325984",

However, manipulation of stem cells can only be achieved by understanding how they are regulated. It is increasingly evident that this regulation is achieved by environmental cues emanating from their specialized environment (niche). While many signaling pathways influence stem cell activity, beta-catenin signaling profoundly impacts the stem cell fate, inducing divergent cellular responses when induced or ablated. Recently, we have shown that during intestinal development over-expressing Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the stem cell niche impacts the stem cell's proliferative capacity. Based on this data we believe that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in establishing the developing intestinal stem cell niche and maintaining the mature niche in the adult. The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is organized in a temporal manner to establish the intestinal stem cell niche and in a spatial manner for maintenance of the proliferation-to-differentiation progression within the mature niche. To test this hypothesis we will use Wnt-reporter and DNTcf-4 expressing mice (ablated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling) to characterize the temporal and spatial expression pattern of Wnt/beta-catenin activity during the stem cell niche morphogenesis and adulthood. Additionally we will determine if spatial expression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is required to maintain the adult stem cell niche by dissecting and analyzing discrete cell strata within the niche. Disruption of the normal expression of Wnt/beta-catenin by induction of a beta-catenin signaling molecule or a DNTcf-4 molecule will determine the dependence of signaling upon crypt establishment and maintenance. Finally, DNA microarray analysis will identify global changes in gene expression between the cellular regions of the developing stem cell niche (wild-type and DNTcf-4 intestines) to directly determine the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling on stimulation of molecules and pathways. These proposed studies will directly examine the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling on maintenance of the stem cell niche and will shed insight into the regulatory control of intestinal stem cells.","308286",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three genes (GJB2, GJB3, GJB6) encode for gap junction proteins (connexin 26 (Cx26), (Cx30) and (Cx31) respectively), are found to cause dominant and/or recessive hearing loss. How these mutations cause hearing loss remains unknown. While both recessive and dominant mutants have impaired function, the dominant mutants might have additional dominant negative effects on the wild type counterparts or even trans-dominant inhibition effects on each other, as Cx26, Cx30 and Cx31 are all expressed in the cochlea. The loss of gap junction coupling in cochlear cells may affect the homeostasis of potassium ions in the inner ear and cause hearing impairment. To test these hypotheses, cellular and animal models will be generated to analyze the effects of dominant GJB2/Cx26, GJB6/Cx30, and GJB3/Cx31 mutations, with the following three Specific Aims: 1) to determine the effects of dominant GJB2/Cx26, GJB6/Cx30, and GJB3/Cx31 mutations on the assembly, trafficking and function of their cognate mutant protein in gap junction-deficient HeLa cells; 2) to determine the effects of dominant GJB2/Cx26, GJB6/Cx30, and GJB3/Cx31 mutations on HeLa cells that express wild-type human Cx26, Cx30 and Cx31; 3) to generate and analyze animal models of selected dominant GJB2/Cx26 mutations, by expressing these mutants in the mesenchymal cells of the cochlea. The trafficking and functional results of the cellular and animal models will elucidate the fundamental cellular and molecular mechanism of dominant GJB2/Cx26, GJB6/Cx30, and GJB3/Cx31 mutations, and the animal models of selected mutations will serve as a fundamental resource for further study of the causes and treatments of these inherited causes of deafness. The principle investigator proposed this five year supervised research experience and didactic training to serve as a transitional period from a clinician to a clinician scientist. Dr. Scherer, who has performed similar analyses on the effects of GJB1/Cx32 mutations, will mentor her scientific development, along with Dr. Crenshaw, an established investigator in neurobiology and auditory biology. The work will be supported by the collaboration of Dr. Saunders, an established investigator in the neurobiology and physiology of hearing. An external advisory committee of highly regarded expert in connexin and auditory biology will provide additional support and advice. My goal is to become a well trained independent investigator in biomedicine. The excellent academic environment and the tremendous resource at the University of Pennsylvania, as well as the commitment of her institute will maximize her potential to succeed.

DESCRIPTION:  For more than a century, heart disease has been one of the most devastating health care issues facing the Western world, and is the single leading killer in America. Because the capacity for cardiac muscle to repair itself appears to be minimal at best, cardiac patients are often left with permanent damage that compromises pump function and deteriorates to a chronic state of heart failure. The associated economic cost of heart disease in the US alone is expected to exceed $250 billion dollars in 2006. Therefore, there has recently been tremendous excitement about novel cell-based approaches for replacing, repairing or regenerating damaged myocardium. However, the practical benefit of such strategies has been obscured by inconsistent results and very low survival rates of implanted cell grafts. The success of these techniques has been limited by a lack of control and understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved. This is partly due to a missing link in the available experimental methods. Success in the petri dish does not ensure translation to the animal model, and testing in animal models often involves such a complex combination of factors that it is difficult to interpret the outcomes. One approach that has been central to the study of cardiac muscle physiology is the use of isolated organ or tissue preparations. However, viability is limited to a few hours or days at best, which is insufficient to test a long term healing response. Clearly, the understanding of heart disease and mechanisms of repair would benefit from a simplified heart model that could be created in a tissue culture laboratory for high throughput in vitro testing. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to use the principles of tissue engineering to create the first simplified heart chamber, or cardiac organoid, that exhibits the essential characteristics of ventricular pump function and can serve as an idealized surrogate heart for efficient evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies in vitro. By allowing independent control of chamber geometry, tissue composition, circulating biochemical factors, and mechanical loading conditions, this system would offer an unprecedented ability to study the effects of modulating a myocardial niche environment. Unlike more traditional cardiac patches or strips, the engineered tissue chamber would allow direct measurement of relevant functional relationships between pressure and volume that ultimately characterize the heart as a pump. Key aspects of this proposal are considered to be exploratory and developmental in nature, consistent with the objectives of the R21 funding mechanism.

From work funded by the first cycle of this grant, we now know that PTHrP acts as a signal from the epithelial cells of the mammary bud to the surrounding mesenchyme that promotes the differentiation of a mammary-specific condensed mesenchyme, maintains the mammary fate of the epithelial cells, instructs the overlying keratinocytes to form the nipple and supports outgrowth of the bud into the initial duct system. In this cycle, will plan to study the molecular mechanisms by which PTHrP signaling accomplishes these developmental events. We have also found that PTHrP is made by terminal end-buds in the growing epithelial ducts of the mammary gland during puberty, while the PTH1R is expressed in the surrounding stromal cells. Our data suggest that PTHrP inhibits the effects of estrogen on ductal growth. In this cycle, we will explore the mechanisms by which PTHrP modulates the effects of estrogen on mammary stromal cells during puberty. In order to pursue these goals, we propose three specific aims. The first will examine the interactions between PTHrP and BMP signaling in the embryonic mammary bud. The second will use gene array technology to define the mesenchymal factors that are responsible for promoting ductal outgrowth in response to PTHrP signaling. The third will seek to establish whether endogenous PTHrP acts to restrain ductal growth in response to estrogen, and will explore the potential interactions between PTHrP signaling and estrogen-induced epidermal growth factor receptor activation in mammary stromal cells. The processes involved in breast cancer progression and metastasis are in many ways similar to those involved n embryonic and pubertal mammary development. We hope that our studies will contribute to a better understanding of both normal mammary development and the pathogenesis of breast cancer.","357030",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating disabled-2 (Dab2) protein expression levels. Dab2 is a cytoplasmic adaptor molecule that is associated with clathrin mediated endocytosis. It was originally identified as a protein down-regulated in ovarian carcinoma and it has since been established that its expression levels have significant impact on cellular proliferation, differentiation, and cancer development. It has been designated as a putative tumor suppressor due to its decreased expression levels in ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic carcinoma cells. We have obtained preliminary data suggesting that, in addition to transcriptional regulation, cellular Dab2 expression levels are also maintained through post-transcriptional mechanisms involving transcript-specific translational control and ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. In two cellular differentiation systems, a TGFbeta-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation model in mouse mammary epithelial (NMuMG) cells and a retinoic acid (RA)-induced visceral endoderm differentiation model in F9 teratocarcinoma cells, we present data suggesting that transcriptional induction of Dab2 mRNA alone can not account for induced Dab2 protein expression levels. We demonstrate that under basal .conditions, Dab2 expression levels are translationally silenced through a mechanism driven by sequence elements contained in the Dab2 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Cytosolic extracts from TGFbeta-treated NMuMG or RA-treated F9 cells can overcome this 3'- UTR-mediated silencing, resulting in increased Dab2 protein expression. We further show that once synthesized, Dab2 levels are regulated through a GSK-3beta-dependent phosphorylation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation pathway. These results demonstrate that Dab2 expression is highly regulated and support the hypothesis that its expression levels underlie its proliferate and differentiative functions. In this proposal, we wish to further explore the molecular mechanisms through which Dab2 expression levels are regulated and determine whether dysregulation of these mechanisms might underlie its aberrant expression in cancer.

mechanisms that control tumor cell aggressiveness and metastasis. Important changes occur in cellular responses to
external signals when cells are neoplastically transformed by potent oncoproteins such as Ras, and this may result in
collaborative effects that push the phenotype toward aggressive tumor behavior. This application seeks to explore the
mechanisms underlying the transition of tumor cells from a benign to a malignant phenotype. A clear understanding of
the mechanisms behind these processes will provide avenues to more selective therapeutic interventions for the
prevention of metastasis from primary tumors. Exploration of these areas also holds promise for the identification of
more sensitive and specific biomarkers that may be predictive of cancer patient outcome. Our Central hypothesis is
as follows: EMT is a critical and potentially reversible step in the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype in
carcinoma. Improved understanding of the regulators of EMT may lead to novel biomarkers or novel molecular
targets for cancer therapy. We and others have demonstrated that the Smad4 protein is a key regulator in these
processes. Specific sub-hypotheses for each aim relate to this central hypothesis regarding the role of Smad4 in EMT
and provide the basis for hypothesis-testing experiments. Aim 1) Determine the mechanisms by which Ras
cooperates with Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-ft) to promote EMT and tumor progression.
Hypothesis: Ras transformation of intestinal epithelial cells sets the stage for effective EMT induction by TGF-J3. We
will test whether the combined effects of Ras + TGF-P exert their effect via (1 A) altered BMP signaling, or through the
production of EGF ligands (1B). Aim 2) Determine the TGF-[}-independent mechanism of Smad4 action in cancer
cell EMT. Hypothesis: Smad4 is a critical modulator of EMT that functions in TGF-P independent cell regulation. We
will test the whether Smad4 exerts its effects via (2A) regulation of the tight junction protein, claudin-1, through
changes in claudin-1 gene expression (2B) or by (2C) restoration of BMP signaling. The clinical relevance of our
findings will be explored in 2D. Aim 3) Determine whether gene expression differences between Smad4 deficient
colorectal cancer cells and their Smad4 expressing clones predict a set of regulatory factors critical to EMT
and the metastatic phenotype. Given the importance of Smad4 as a tumor suppressor and our preliminary
observations that it has important roles independent of TGF-p, we will use a gene expression microarray approach to
identify gene expression differences that are associated with the phenotypic response to Smad4 expression that occur
independently of TGF-p signaling. Hypothesis: Smad4 mediated EMT reversion is associated with altered gene
expression patterns that are linked to mechanisms underlying EMT and metastasis. We will test for differences in
expression profiles in human colon cancer cells transfected with Smad4 (3A) and validate the findings of microarray at
mRNA and protein levels and determine the roles of selected targets in the phenotypic response to Smad4 expression
(3B).","272145",

A key issue in skin morphogenesis is how the topological arrangements of keratinocytes are organized to construct the complex three-dimensional appendage structures. Our long-term objective is to study the cellular and molecular basis of morphogenesis during the development and regeneration of skin appendages. We have been using chicken skin as the model for distinct forms, possibility for epithelial-mesenchymal recombination experiments and new technology for misexpressing genes in developing feathers. In the last funding period, we focused on early events of feather bud development. In this renewal, we will focus on late events in feather follicle morphogenesis, which have a complex, three level hierarchical branch structure and involve reciprocal interactions between feather stem cells and the dermal papilla.  
  
In Aim 1, we will study the axial determination of epithelial organs by analyzing how the bilaterally and radially symmetric feather follicle designs are built differently. We will test the tilting stem cell ring hypothesis that suggests the rachis and bilateral symmetry can be generated simply by tilting the ring of stem cells down toward the anterior end and creating a molecular gradient that breaks symmetry. Wnt and beta-catenin pathways are involved. In Aim 2, we will study how a cylindrical layer of feather filament keratinocytes can be ""sculpted"" into the elaborate barb/barbule branches with distinct structures and functions. We hypothesize that the geometric forms reflect the dazzling regulation of keratinocyte proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation functioning to its extreme (barbules are composed of a single row of keratinocytes), and that the length and characteristics of barbules mirror the antagonizing balance of molecular activities. BMP, Shh and Wnt pathways will be prioritized, among other pathways. In Aim 3, we will study the control of plasticity and specificity of different skin appendages. We propose that there is a gradual restriction of competence of the epidermis, coupled with a gradual increase of regional specificity conferred by the mesenchyme. FGF and T-box homeobox genes in feather / scale paradigm will be the model. These aims will be tested using the methodology mentioned above.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human adult skeleton undergoes continuous remodeling, a delicate balance between bone formation by the osteoblast and bone resorption by the osteoclast. Intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is able to greatly stimulate bone formation by acting through its receptor on the osteoblast. Recently, I, in Dr. Nicola Partridge's laboratory, identified that amphiregulin, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like ligand, is strongly upregulated by PTH in the osteoblast and that the EOF signaling pathway plays an important role in normal bone development. Although EGF-like ligands and their signaling pathways have been extensively studied in many tissues and cancers, there are few reports of them in the skeletal field due to the lack of evidence that they are expressed in bone and that they participate in remodeling. From my preliminary data, I hypothesize that EGF signaling participates in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal cell lineages, such as osteoblasts, adipocytes and chrondrocytes, and that PTH uses amphiregulin as the mediator to manipulate the microenvironment of bone marrow stromal stem cells. Thus, the goal of the present application is to delineate the role of EGF-like ligands, especially amphiregulin, in bone metabolism and in PTH's action on bone. To achieve it, I will use the following approaches: 1. Identifying amphiregulin target cells in bone and investigating how PTH treatment affects these cells, 2. Studying the effect of amphiregulin on the proliferation and differentiation of stromal stem cells, 3. Examining the physiological role of amphiregulin signialing in bone development and in PTH's action using animal models. The results of this work will provide insight into a novel and potentially important signaling pathway in bone development and metabolism and its role in PTH's action on bone.

mediolateral embryonic axis while extending its anteroposterior dimension. We implicated in this cell
polarization process a non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway, similar to the D. melanogaster planar cell
oolarity (PCP) pathway, and identified several of its components: Knypek (Glypican4), Trilobite (Van
gogh/Strabismus) and Rho kinase. However, the mechanisms this pathway employs to polarize cells during
vertebrate gastrulation are not known.
 Our studies revealed that both knypek (kny/gpc4) and trilobite (tri/vang!2) are essential for a subset of
gastrulation cell behaviors, fast directed dorsal migration and mediolateral intercalation. To establish the
dynamic properties underlying these polarized cell behaviors that depend on kny and fri function, we will
determine formation, polarization and stabilization of protrusions, and the orientation of microtubule
cytoskeleton by analyzing cells in kny and tri single, and kny;tri compound mutant gastrulae, and embryos
overexpressing dominant negative Dishevelled (dnDsh).
 We will determine the sequence of cellular events leading to the mediolateral polarization of mesoderm
cells. We will test the involvement of kny, tri and dsh in increased cell packing and other aspects of the
mediolateral cell polarization process. We will use different types of mosaic analyses to test the hypothesis
that kny, and tri are involved in a short-range intercellular communication that mediates cell polarization.
 We will discover new regulators C&E by analysis of mutant loci identified in our screen for genes that
modify the kny gastrulation mutant phenotype. A new mutation, car69 sensitizes embryos to copper levels,
and enhances aspects of the kny mutant phenotype. We will characterize patterning and morphogenetic
defects caused by calvu69, test its genetic interactions with other C&E mutations, and molecularly
characterize the cal locus. Given that aspects of cat phenotype are phenocopied by inhibition of copper
uptake, we will test the hypothesis that Wnt signaling via Kny depends on copper homeostasis. We propose
to carry out precise phenotypic, genetic and molecular characterization of vu66 mutation, which weakly
impairs C&E and acts as homozygous recessive enhancer of the kny gastrulation defect.
 Recent studies demonstrate that the molecular regulation of tumor growth and metastasis is strikingly
similar to that of morphogenetic processes, such as gastrulation. In particular, overexpression of non-
canonical Wnts affects cell motility and invasion of melanoma cells. Our work will further elucidate the
mechanisms whereby non-canonical Wnt signaling regulates invasive cell behaviors in the context of a
developing organism, and will identify additional components of this important pathway.","320454",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Properly formed heart valve leaflets are essential to achieve unidirectional blood flow and thus, are critical for life. The delicate leaflets open and close with each heart beat, promoting optimal heart function by preventing regurgitation and thus, oxygen delivery to tissues throughout the body. Congenital heart defects, many of which affect the heart valves, occur in about 1 in 100 infants. Some congenital valve defects are life threatening from the moment of birth; others are less problematic, but eventually valve replacement becomes necessary in adult life. Despite the critical role of the valves in heart function, relatively little is known about the development of the valves and even less about the cellular and molecular processes that sustain valve function through adult life. We have shown that endothelial cells from adult pulmonary and aortic valve leaflets exhibit valve specific properties that are reminiscent of critical steps in valvulogenesis, indicating that endothelial cells from adult leaflets retain the ability to recapitulate embryonic developmental processes. We have shown that in human valvular endothelial cells, activation and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFATc1 is required for VEGF-induced proliferation and migration, we have also shown that clonal populations of adult valvular endothelial cells can be induced to undergo an endothelial to mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT), a critical event in formation of valve leaflets from the endocardial cushions. The valvular endothelial cell culture models we have established provide powerful tools for identifying genes that control endothelial proliferation and differentiation and for understanding the interplay between proliferation and differentiation in cardiac valves. Three specific aims will be pursued. The first will be to identify and functionally characterize targets of the VEGF/NFATc1 signaling pathway in valve endothelium. The second will be to identify and functionally characterize genes involved in TGF-beta mediated EMT. The third aim will be to examine the cross-regulation between proliferation and differentiation in cardiac valve endothelial cells. Based on new preliminary data, we hypothesize the bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) links these two pathways. Aim 3 has been expanded in this revised application to specifically test the role of BMP-2 in proliferation, migration and EMT in cardiac valve endothelium. The studies proposed here will provide insights on 1) normal functions and capabilities of valvular endothelium, 2) heart valve diseases and potential mechanisms for repair, and 3) strategies to create improved valve replacements for patients suffering from valve-specific defects.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital heart defects affect 1/200 live births and many of these defects have poor surgical outcomes. Recently it has been shown that surgical cures during the neonatal or pediatric period can result in significant morbidity and mortality later in adulthood [1]. In order to have better patient outcomes in the future it is evident that alternate therapies are needed for the treatment and prevention of congenital heart diseases. To create useful therapeutics directed at preventing or treating these defects, the molecular events controlling normal and aberrant heart development must be uncovered. The retinoid X receptor alpha knockout mouse (RXRa-/-) shows cardiac defects which phenocopy human cases of congenital heart disease. In this mouse, proper chamber and outflow tract (OFT) septation does not occur due to hypoplasticity of cardiac cushion tissue and fetal death occurs in late-midgestation due to cardiac failure [2]. Transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF(32), a cytokine affecting cellular growth, differentiation, and apoptosis is upregulated in the hearts of RXRa-/- versus wild type (WT) animals [3]. This increase in TGF02 signaling is related to increased apoptosis in the RXRa-/- heart and these knockouts, when bred onto a TGFB2 background show an attenuation of OFT septation defects [3]. These data suggest that the retinoid and TGFB pathways intersect to regulate cardiac development and preliminary studies support the potential for direct interaction between retinoid signaling and signaling molecules downstream of TGFB2 (i.e. Smad2) [66]. The proposed study will establish the nature of these interactions and their relevance during heart development. We hypothesize that direct interactions between TGFB and retinoid signaling regulate critical aspects of cardiac development particularly OFT remodeling. Spatial and temporal characterization of TGFB and retinoid pathway players will be performed to determine any relevant canonical feedback mechanisms at work in the RXRa-/-. Additionally, the effects of heterozygosity for Smad2 and SmadS on the RXRa-/- will be investigated on the morphological and molecular levels. Public Health Relevance: These experiments will yield a better understanding of the molecular events controlling normal and aberrant cardiac development. It is our hope that discoveries generated from these studies will lead to the eventual development of therapeutics to better treat congenital heart disease.

Indeed, organogenesis can initiate in the absence of transferrin/transferrin receptor, and in many lineages, iron delivery by transferrin is stage specific. However, there are few, if any proteins that can substitute for, or complement
transferrin. These studies are of general importance because acquisition of iron is required for growth, and it is of local importance, because iron regulates specific subsets of genes by transcriptional and translational effects.
My lab is dedicated to finding mechanisms of kidney induction, a process that generates nephrons from mesenchymal cells. We previously identified a set of cytokines that stimulate this conversion and now we have identified a new nephron inducer called Ngal, a member of the lipocalin superfamily. These proteins are not well known, and functional
data are limited, but they are thought to transport low molecular weight compounds, which they deliver to cells by endocytosis. We propose that Ngal can transport iron, and that its inductive activity results from iron-Ngal. Ngal was not a substitute for transferrin-they traffic to different organelles and they target different domains in the developing mesenchyme. In vitro, Ngal and transferrin were both required for induction, acting in a sequential fashion.
To evaluate Ngal traffic, we will isolate the Ngal receptor. The receptor should describe a domain of cells in the periphery of the kidney that is likely to include epithelial progenitors and stroma and it will describe a unique subcellular pathway. The identification is also important in order to evaluate why Ngal is so highly expressed in a variety, of epithelial diseases. Then we will identify the pool of iron that regulates gene expression and determine how it
varies with development by using a novel genetic probe in vivo. The response to this pool of iron is tested by examining candidate genes and microarrays; it appears to include genes that are known to control kidney development. Lastly, we will test the hypothesis that iron delivery is required at particular stages of mesenchymal conversion by first
determining whether Ngal requires iron for its inductive activity in vitro, and then examining when and where transferrin is essential in vivo. The later requires rescue of the embryos in vivo. These studies implicate iron as a critical regulator in morphogenesis, and define its stage specific functions during the conversion of mesenchyme to epithelia."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cadherin cell-cell adhesion junctions establish the epithelial cell phenotype, prevent their epithelial to mesenchymal transition, define cell cytoarchitecture and signal morphogenesis. We seek to understand the function of these cell-cell junctions as guardians against the induction of cataract. Our studies show a unique structure/function relationship between cadherin junctions, their cytoskeletal linkages and lens differentiation state. Dynamic, highly detergent-soluble N-cadherin/2-catenin adherens junctions define the cytoarchitecture of lens epithelial cells while establishment of the highly ordered and elongated cytoarchitecture of differentiating lens fiber cells involves stabilization of cadherin junctions. We discovered the presence of a novel N-cadherin junctional complex in lens fiber cells, linked to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton through 3-catenin. We will investigate this novel cadherin complex for its role in providing the elongating lens fiber cells with the unique structural properties required for their differentiation and stability. In addition, we will study the differentiation-specific role of N-cadherin junctional complexes in the organization of the cytoskeleton and examine the role of the cytoskeleton in stabilizing cadherin differentiation-specific function. Interestingly, Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs), regulators of cadherin junctions, have a dual role in lens differentiation. The SFK Src maintains lens epithelial cells in a proliferative, undifferentiated state and the SFK Fyn signals lens fiber cell differentiation. In this proposal we continue our investigation of the mechanisms of SFK regulation of N-cadherin junctional stability, and N-cadherin-linked SFK signaling of lens cell differentiation, in a pathway involving PI3K and Rac. Our previous studies show that the unregulated, constitutive activation of Src kinases disassembles lens cadherin junctions. We now find in a culture model for stress-induced cataract that lens opacities result from activation of a p38 stress kinase/Src kinase signaling pathway that targets the cadherin junctions. If Src kinase activation is blocked, both cadherin junctions and normal lens cytoarchitecture are maintained, and the development of lens opacities is prevented. We will investigate the mechanism of N-cadherin junction destabilization in cataract, focusing on the role protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) as molecular regulators of both Src kinases and cadherin junctions. PTPs are inactivated by reactive oxygen species, a common cause of stress-induced cataract. It is hoped that in the long-term, understanding of this pathway will provide suitable pharmaceutical targets for the prevention of cataract. Will investigate our hypotheses in three specific aims: (1) Examine the hypothesis that N-cadherin regulates the cytoskeleton to establish and maintain lens structure and stability; (2) Examine the hypothesis that the Src kinases regulate lens cell differentiation state by their action as both upstream regulators and downstream signaling effectors of cadherin junctions; (3) Examine the hypothesis that misregulation of Src kinases abrogates the role of cadherin junctions and the cytoskeleton as protectors of lens structural stability and guardians against cataract. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cataracts are opacities of the lens that interfere with its ability to focus an image on the retina. While many of the properties of cataract have been determined, the mechanism of cataract induction and potential methods of cataract prevention still remain elusive. The long term goals of this proposal are to understand the role of cadherin cell-cell junctions as guardians against this lens disease.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will uncover the roles of Sox4, Sox11, and Sox12 in skeletogenic cells in vivo. These three highly related proteins form the subfamily C of Sry-related HMG box (Sox) transcription factors. Their genes are co-expressed in skeletogenic mesenchymal cells throughout the mouse embryo, and remain differentially expressed when these cells undergo chondrocyte and osteoblast differentiation. While the roles of Sox12 in vivo remain unknown, mice lacking Sox4 and/or Sox11 have started to reveal important roles for these two genes in multiple steps of skeletogenesis. The molecular roles of Sox C proteins remain largely unknown, but preliminary studies have suggested that they may bind DNA and activate transcription similarly but with different efficiencies. These data raise the hypothesis that Sox C proteins may have redundant, complementary, or distinct molecular roles in controlling skeletogenic cell fate and differentiation. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 is to further study the roles of the Sox C proteins in mouse embryo skeletogenesis. Mice carrying Sox11 and Sox12 conditional null alleles will be generated using the same strategy that was used to generate a Sox4 conditional null allele. Well-established Cre transgenes will be used to specifically inactivate the genes in the entire embryo or at specific steps during skeletogenesis. Skeletal defects will be characterized at the morphological, cellular and molecular levels, and primary cell culture experiments will be carried out to complement in vivo studies. Aim 2 is to characterize the molecular roles of Sox C proteins in skeletogenic cells. The DNA-binding and transactivation properties of the three Sox C proteins will be further studied using standard in vitro and cell culture assays. Potential target genes will be identified by gene expression array screening. The action of Sox C proteins on target gene regulatory sequences will be studied using DNA-binding and transactivation assays in vitro and in vivo. It is anticipated that this study will identify Sox C proteins as essential determinants of skeletogenic cells from pluripotent precursor stages until late maturation in specific cell lineages, and will thereby provide significant insights into molecular mechanisms involved in normal skeletogenesis and in genetic and acquired diseases of the skeleton.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Approximately 90% of breast cancer deaths are caused by metastasis, and the median survival time for patients with metastatic breast cancer is approximately 2 years. Therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms at work in the initiation and progression of metastasis is important for prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Our long-term goal is to reduce the incidence of breast cancer metastasis by gaining an understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the initial step of breast cancer metastasis. As the master switch for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the initial step of metastasis, Snail plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of metastasis. Overexpression of Snail correlates with tumor grade and nodal metastasis of breast cancer, but the mechanism remains unclear. We recently demonstrated that the activity of Snail is regulated mainly by its protein stability and cellular location. Using an unbiased approach-tandem array purification (TAP) coupled with mass spectrometry analysis, we identified the interaction of Snail with EPLINb (Epithelial Protein Lost in Neoplasm). We found that downregulation of EPLINP correlated with the upregulation of Snail in breast cancer cell lines and metastatic breast cancer specimens. We further demonstrated that expression of EPLINb induces degradation of Snail and relieves suppression of the E-cadherin promoter mediated by Snail. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that EPLINb functions as a negative regulator for Snail and that loss of EPLINb in breast cancer induces the stabilization and nuclear localization of Snail, thus triggering breast cancer progression and metastasis. The objective of this proposal is to decipher the functional regulation of Snail by EPLINb in breast cancer and explore the prognostic value of EPLINb and Snail as markers of metastasis in breast cancer. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test this hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to delineate the regions on Snail and EPLINb required for their association; (2) to determine whether the loss of EPLINb enhances the stabilization of Snail; and (3) to define the functional regulation of Snail and EPLINb in mouse and human breast cancer. Our proposal is innovative and significant to public health because knowledge gained from this study will expand the understanding of the initiation and progression of metastasis and holds great promise for novel interventions for preventing and treating breast cancer.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this project is to determine the role of bone marrow (BM) stem/progenitor cells in regulating fibrocyte homeostasis in the mammalian inner ear. It is well established that specific subpopulations of inner ear fibrocytes are actively involved in the generation of electrochemical gradients essential to normal auditory function. Injury to or loss of these cells resulting from ototoxins, noise-trauma, genetic defects and aging is associated with a range of hearing and balance disorders. These highly specialized fibrocytes undergo continuous replacement throughout life and their turnover rate has been shown to increase with injury and decrease with age. However, it is not known whether this self renewal is mediated by a resident population of adult stem/progenitor cells or through some other mechanism. New data provided here document that cells derived from BM have the capacity to engraft and differentiate towards ion transport fibrocyte phenotypes in the mouse inner ear. These data also suggest that BM may provide a continuous source of stem/progenitor cells for fibrocyte turnover in the inner ear but this remains unproven. Three Specific Aims are designed to address these important issues. Aim 1 will evaluate the relative ability of two highly purified populations of BM stem/progenitor cells to engraft and differentiate into fibrocytes in the normal inner ear. Aim 2 will investigate the potential of BM stem/progenitor cells to replace fibrocytes or other inner ear cell types damaged by chemical injury, genetic mutations or aging. Aim 3 seeks to develop and optimize procedures for the direct introduction of BM stem/progenitor cells into the inner ear. The experimental design incorporates mouse BM transplantation and parabiosis models employing donor cells that express high levels of EGFP, allowing their tracking with immunological and histochemical procedures. Given the increasing evidence that defects or injuries to inner ear fibrocytes are associated with a wide range of hearing and balance disorders, it is important to obtain further knowledge about the derivation of these cells and the mechanisms mediating their turnover and replacement in both the normal, traumatized and aging inner ear. Such knowledge will be essential in the design of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of inner ear disorders associated with injury or destruction of specialized populations of inner ear fibrocytes.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infertility and pregnancy loss represent major public health problems in women. Our long- range goal is to discover and understand the hormonal, cellular, and molecular mechanisms regulating uterine morphogenesis and function in order to provide fundamental information useful for prevention and clinical treatment of women's health problems. The success of developmental mechanisms regulating uterine morphogenesis dictates, in part, the embryotrophic potential and functional capacity of the adult uterus. In humans, uterine morphogenesis begins late in fetal life and is not completed until after birth, thereby precluding study of this critical process. Therefore, the proposed research will utilize mice as a model system to investigate genes governing uterine morphogenesis and function. The focus of this proposal is on Wnt7a, a gene that encodes a secreted protein that is expressed specifically in the epithelium of the developing and adult uterus. Genome- wide disruption of Wnt7a results in infertility due to uterine and oviductal malformations arising from developmental defects in Mullerian duct patterning and specification in the embryo. The central hypothesis is that Wnt7a is a critical regulator of postnatal endometrial gland morphogenesis and stromal growth and uterine receptivity to the embryo during pregnancy. In order to circumvent the developmental defects when Wnt7a is deleted in the embryo, we propose to conditionally ablate Wnt7a in the epithelium of the uterus after birth using the Cre/LoxP system and the innovative progesterone receptor-Cre knockin mouse model. The progesterone receptor is only expressed in the epithelium of the uterus after birth and is not expressed during Mullerian duct differentiation. The conditional mutant mice will be used to test our central hypothesis and understand the biological roles of Wnt7a in postnatal uterine morphogenesis, endometrial regeneration and adult uterine function. Accomplishment of these research goals is expected to significantly advance our understanding of the developmental aspects of uterine biology, determinants of adult uterine function, and provide a foundation for the design of clinical therapies to prevent, identify and treat human reproductive problems, such as infertility and pregnancy loss, due to uterine dysgenesis, dysplasia or dysfunction. This research will advance our understanding of the how the uterus develops. Abnormal development of the uterus can cause infertility and pregnancy loss in women. This research will help determine important genes for reproduction and help to design clinical therapies to prevent, identify and treat reproductive problems in women.

Despite recent advancements in medical intervention, babies born with calvarial defects often suffer multiple handicaps that significantly compromise the quality of their lives. The cranial neural crest (CMC) is an important population of multipotent embryonic progenitor cells which ultimately contribute to a diverse array of differentiated craniofacial tissues, including the calvarial mesenchyme, and plays an integral role during calvarial morphogenesis. An understanding of the manner in which CMC cells contribute to calvaria development and the molecular mechanism which regulates the fate of CNC are critical for understanding normal craniofacial development as well as CMC-related congenital malformations. Multiple growth and transcription factors have been identified as critical regulators for calvarial morphogenesis. Specifically, TGF-beta in the CMC-derived mesenchyme can induce premature cranial suture obliteration in postnatal calvaria development. It is not understood; however, what is the functional significance of TGF-b signaling in regulating the fate of the CMC-derived mesenchyme during initial calvaria morphogenesis. To address this issue, we have generated mice with conditional Tgfbr2 fl/fl; Wnt1-Cre gene ablation in neural crest cells. These Tgfbr2 fl/fl; mice show missing frontal bones and other craniofacial malformations with 100% phenotype penetrance. Significantly, disruption of the TGF-b signaling does not adversely affect the CNC migration, indicating that the TGF-b-mediated gene expression is specifically required locally during calvarial morphogenesis. Taking advantage of our Tgfbr2 fl/fl and other mutant animal models we design studies to investigate the hierarchy of TGF-b signaling in regulating the fate of CNC cells during frontal bone development by testing the hypothesis that TGF-beta signaling regulates the expression of Msx1, which in turn controls the progression of cell cycle to regulate the fate of CMC-derived mesenchymal cells during frontal bone morphogenesis. Ultimately, this study will provide a better understanding on how the TGF- beta signaling cascade regulates the fate of CNC cells during normal craniofacial development and how signaling disruption can lead to craniofacial malformations.

Multipotential mesenchymal cells have been identified that can be propagated indefinitely amd differentiate within weeks into any one of a number of different cell lineages, in a manner controlled by the culture conditions. In addition to sequence specific DNA binding proteins, gene expression can be modified by the state of DNA methylation and the types and positions of modified residues in the core histones of nucleosomes. Further groups of proteins have been identified genetically and biochemically that function to stabilize gene activity or silence and interact with or participate in chromatin modification.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application aims at deciphering the molecular pathways supporting satellite cell function and at understanding how these are influenced during aging. Age-related skeletal muscle deterioration (sarcopenia) is characterized by a decline in mass, strength, endurance and repair capacity, and by fat accumulation between and within myofibers. Myofiber repair is enabled by satellite cells, myogenic stem cells situated underneath the myofiber basal lamina. Subtle muscle injuries that occur during routine muscle activity raise a continuous demand for functional myofiber repair throughout life. However, satellite cell performance declines in old age and this decline can be a contributory factor to sarcopenia. While satellite cells have classically been thought to function as tissue-specific myogenic progenitors, we have shown that they can also enter a mesenchymal alternative path, which culminates in terminal adipogenic differentiation. Such an alternative lineage commitment may contribute to impaired myogeneity and increased muscle adipostiy in old age. Gaining insight into mechanisms involved in impairing satellite cell self-renewal and myogeneity, and in promoting their mesenchymal plasticity, will contribute to the design of therapies to improve the number and function of myogenic progenitors in aging muscle. Accordingly, the aims of this proposal are: 1) Investigate the potential of satellite cells to contribute myogenic progeny and undergo self-renewal throughout life. 2) Determine the role of the myogenic transcription factors Myf5 and MyoD, and the muscle integrin alpha7, in the balance between myogenic versus mesenchymal alternative fate of satellite cells. 3) Investigate the effect of metalloproteinase and disintegrin activities on mesenchymal fate and self-renewal of satellite cells. Wildtype and genetically modified mice, of age groups ranging from juvenile to senile, will be investigated. Satellite cell performance will be examined in isolated myofibers and clones, using protein and RNA expression methodologies. Additionally, the functional role of relevant genes will be determined by transducing satellite cells with viral-based expression vectors. The proposed studies will contribute new insight into the status of satellite cells in adult and aging muscles, and will, therefore, provide important information for muscle rehabilitation strategies during disease and aging.  
Skeletal muscle repair is enabled by myogenic progenitors named satellite cells. Age-associated decline in the performance of these cells can be a contributory factor to the deterioration of skeletal muscle in old age (sarcopenia). The proposed studies will contribute new insight into the regulation of satellite cell function throughout the lifespan and will, therefore, provide important information for muscle rehabilitation strategies during disease and aging.

important role in the development of fibrotic repair pathologies. In the lens of the eye, fibrotic pathologies
mediated by TGFP include anterior subcapsular cataracts (ASC) and posterior capsular opacification (PCO).
The cellular changes that precede fibrosis in ASC and PCO include an increased proliferation of lens
epithelial cells (LECs), which under go an epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) into
myofibroblasts, involving loss of E-cadherin and induced a-smooth muscle actin (aSMA) expression. The
long-term goal of this project is to determine the TGFp-mediated signals, which alter the genetic makeup and
phenotype of lens epithelial cells during ASC. Using a previously developed rat lens culture model in which
exogenous TGFP induces ASC we have shown that treatment with agents that inhibit enzymatic activity of
Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) family members (MMPIs) suppresses the TGFp-induced cataractous
changes. Further preliminary findings suggest the testable hypothesis that MMPIs act to inhibit TGFP-
induced EMT and ASC in the lens by suppressing MMP-mediated E-cadherin degradation by
shedding. The RSmad, SmadS, is a common effector of TGFP signaling, which has been identified in the
lens. However, we have found using two different mouse models that in the absence of SmadS (in Smad3 KO
mice) TGFpl can induce EMT in the lens, demonstrating the involvement of SmadS-independent signaling in
ASC formation. Additional findings suggest that the hypothesis that TGFp-induced ASC involves signaling
MAP kinase pathways, specifically p38,which act independently of Smad3. To test these hypotheses we
will utilize the in vitro TGFp-induced rat lens model of ASC, as well as, genetically modified mice, including
MMP-2, MMP-9 and SmadS KO mice. The effect of MMPIs on E-cadherin expression and shedding will be
further examined using RT-QPCR in combination with laser capture microdissection, western blotting and
immunolocalization. The requirement for activated pSSMAPKin ASC formation will be investigated in both
the in vivo and in vitro models using specific Pp38 kinase inhibitors. These data will aid in defining the
TGFp-mediated pathways controlling EMT and fibrosis in ASC. Furthermore, since the genes and signaling

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
The kidney regulates water/salt balance, nitrogenous waste, blood pressure and blood composition. Kidney function is vital to homeostasis of the body fluids. Chronic kidney disease affects one in nine Americans, a similar number are at risk. The heath care, societal and individual toll of kidney disease is profound. A rigorous understanding of normal kidney development and repair should underpin logical efforts to design new therapeutic strategies for this vital organ system. The basic functional unit of the kidney is the nephron. The full complement of nephrons, approximately half a million in man, form over a lengthy period of fetal life. In this process, uncommitted mesenchymal progenitors are induced to form epithelial nephron precursors, the renal vesicle and other cellular components of the adult organ. The renal vesicle undergoes a complex morphogenesis and patterning process to establish the mature nephron with its distinct physiological domains positioned appropriately along the length of the epithelial tubule. Depending on the mammalian species, nephrogenesis is complete in fetal or early post-natal life. Thereafter, the only option is to maintain and repair these early-formed structures. The long-term goal of our research effort is directed at defining the molecular and cellular processes that establish a functional physiological system during the course of organ development. Given the clinical importance of the kidney, its well-defined physiological roles and the rich history of embryological study over several decades, this organ is an attractive model. We will combine genetic and genomic approaches to understand how the kidney is built from its constituent cell parts in the mouse. In Aim 1, we will define the cellular complexity of the developing kidney's progenitor pools, determine the progenitor-product relationships between uncommitted cells in the kidney and their mature descendants, and identify the cellular mechanisms that maintain progenitors thereby establishing the full complement of nephrons. In Aim 2, we will specifically address the transcriptional actions of opposing regulators, Six2 and _- catenin/canonical Wnt signaling, on the maintenance and commitment of purified nephron progenitors. The transcriptional programs of each will be examined by transcriptional profiling and direct DNA-binding studies and the regulatory networks mined from these data sets. In Aim 3, we will determine whether Notch, a proximalizing factor in the context of the epithelial nephron, can directly induce mesenchymal nephron progenitors to form clinically relevant proximal cell fates, notably podocytes. We will utilize similar strategies to those above to understand Notch's regulatory action in the critical early patterning processes that establish functional cellular asymmetry in the developing nephron. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease affects one in nine Americans, a similar number are at risk. Determining the normal mechanisms of organ assembly and repair are high priorities. The proposed study utilizes mouse genetic models and genomic strategies to determine the molecular and cellular processes that establish a full complement of functional nephrons during mammalian development from pools of early renal progenitor/stem cells.

During development, these events are central to the outgrowth and branching of structures such as the ureteric bud as it forms the collecting system of the kidney and the epithelial bud of the lung as it forms the bronchial tree. In the adult, injury to the kidney results in a reversal of this process with de-differentiation of the surviving epithelia into a more mesenchymal phenotype, which must then undergo growth factor mediated cell spreading, migration, and proliferation to successfully regenerate a functional tubule. Due to the central nature of cell shape change in both of these processes, our laboratory has focused its research efforts on understanding how growth factors can mediate cell morphogenesis. The results of this work have led us to an understanding that activation of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in the regulation of cell morphogenesis by several growth factors, and has resulted in our discovery that paxillin, a protein in the focal adhesion complex that is critical for the turnover of sites of contact between the cell and its matrix, is associating with, and phosphorylated by, the Raf/MEK/ERK members of the MAPK pathway. We believe that this association underlies a novel role for paxillin as a scaffold to selectively facilitate MAPK signaling at the focal adhesion complex. Exploration of the mechanism of this scaffolding effect is of particular importance because it addresses the fundamental question of how the effects of a signaling pathway (such as MAPK) that is activated by multiple different stimuli can still be insulated in such a way as to ultimately regulate specific cellular targets under specific conditions. This will be undertaken by first identifying the role of paxillin as a scaffold for MAPK activation in the cell (SA 1), then determining the events that ERK regulates at the focal adhesion (SA 2), and finally exploring the importance of these events in both single cell morphogenesis as well as multicellular organogenesis during development (SA 3).","357028",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal extends our ongoing investigation into the molecular basis of cellular interactions that guide the proper development and adult function of the female reproductive tract. We have demonstrated that Wnt genes direct the proper cytodifferentiation and overall development of the female reproductive tract. Analyses of two WNT mouse mutants (Wnt7a and Wnt5a) has confirmed that Wnt gene activity is not only crucial for proper development but also participates in regulating adult function including changes that occur during estrous in the uterus, cervix and vagina. The fact that circulating steroid hormones regulate Wnt gene expression led us to investigate how exogenous estrogenic compounds may adversely affect reproductive tract development. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic estrogen agonist, which was administered to pregnant women between 1940-1976. Daughters born to mothers who took DES experienced a high rate of reproductive tract malformations and a higher incidence of reproductive tract precancerous and cancer pathologies. We have demonstrated that Wnt7a is down-regulated by DES exposure during a critical perinatal period of perinatal development. Furthermore, since the transient down-regulation of Wnt7a recapitulates the effects of a complete loss-of-function of Wnt7a in the female reproductive tract, we conclude that the key molecular and cellular responses to Wnt genes occur at birth. This proposal will focus upon determining the signaling pathway(s) through which these crucial Wnt signals are transduced. We will also examine the role of Msx1, which is expressed in the reproductive tract and is a strong candidate for mediating specific aspects of Wnt signaling. Lastly, we plan to identify 'early' Wnt gene targets in the female reproductive tract that are regulated in response to these signaling events. It is anticipated that changes in gene expression will be both direct and indirect. In women, the pathological effects of fetal DES exposure were recognized several decades later in adult life. In mice, both the DES-exposed wildtype and Wnt7a mutant mouse show aberrant morphology by 1-2 months after birth and precancerous and bona fide tumors by 9-18 months after birth. Thus, the characterization of the genes whose expression is altered at birth as a function of loss of Wnt7a promises to lead to potential early diagnostic markers of cancer and help elucidate early steps in teratogenic and tumorogenic processes in the female reproductive tract. To this end, we will test the function of candidate Wnt7a target genes by direct gene transfer in vivo or use of available mouse mutants. It is anticipated that results from these studies will have a high impact upon our understanding of mechanisms underlying how complex intact tissues in vivo respond to normal hormonal signaling and that this mechanistic understanding will bear upon our understanding of clinical applications of hormone replacement therapies and endocrine disruption.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human embryonic stem cells provide a potentially unlimited source of oral mucosal tissues that can revolutionize the treatment of oral diseases. These stem cells are essential to the success of novel regenerative therapies, due to their plasticity and to their tremendous regenerative potential that can overcome the shortcomings and currently limited supply of post-natal, oral epithelial stem cells. However, many obstacles still limit their therapeutic application, as it is not known if human embryonic stem cells can 1- form 3D epithelial tissues with hierarchical structure, 2 - give rise to cells similar to post-natal, epithelial stem cells or 3 - maintain their differentiated state in 3D tissues. To help overcome these barriers, the immediate goal of this application is to use our novel approaches in 3D tissue biology to provide key insights into the biological properties of human embryonic stem cells to generate 3D oral epithelial tissues that will demonstrate the feasibility of using these new technologies for future oral therapies. We hypothesize that the tissue microenvironment, instructed by basement membrane proteins and fibroblast-derived soluble factors, regulates the self-renewal and differentiation of keratinocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells to generate specialized tissues that mimic oral epithelium. To test this hypothesis, our AIMS are to: 1- Determine if keratinocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells give rise to progenitor cells with properties of post-natal stem cells that can undergo long-term, self-renewal and can differentiate to form 3D epithelia and 2- Begin to explore the cellular- and tissue-based cues, mediated by the stem cell ""niche"" at the basement membrane interface and by fibroblast-derived soluble factors, that direct these events. We expect to set the stage for future studies that will dissect signaling pathways that direct these cues and optimize the growth, differentiation and survival of 3D epithelia. This research is made possible by two major advances in our lab: 1 - Development of engineered, 3D tissues that mimic the oral mucosa to a significant degree and have established a link between the tissue microenvironment, self- renewal of post-natal stem cells and predictable tissue regeneration after in vivo transplantation. 2 - Propagation of H9, human embryonic stem cells (NIH-WA09) committed to an epithelial lineage and generation of immature but multilayer 3D epithelial tissues from their progeny. Our long-term goal is to harness the developmental potential and growth capacity of pluripotent, human embryonic stem cells by gaining convincing evidence that oral epithelial tissues derived from them can serve as long-term, functional replacement tissues to treat oral diseases for which there are no current practical therapies. By doing so, we will advance our understanding of stem cell biology in a fundamental manner to enable future efforts to tailor and engineer lineage-specific tissues of therapeutic importance in humans.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted gene disruption studies have confirmed that Hox genes affect prostate development, but phenotypes of single mutant animals have been generally mild, pleiotropic, and incompletely penetrant. Because of the nature of these defects, it has been difficult to determine the genetic function of Hox genes in the developing prostate. By removing all six functional copies of the Hox11 paralogous genes, we have generated animals with profound defects in the developing prostate. Preliminary data suggests that triple mutant animals display a very disrupted bud pattern and, while the anterior and dorsolateral lobes of the prostate bud from E18.5 urogenital sinuses, they do not branch or develop past this stage. Surviving four-allele animals show incomplete penetrance of these defects as adults. Together with previous data on single mutants in the Hox10 and Hox13 paralogous groups, it appears that the prostate develops in response to anteroposterior patterning signals from the AbdB Hox genes, with Hox10 genes patterning the anterior prostate, Hox11 genes patterning primarily the dorsolateral prostate and Hox13 genes patterning primarily the ventral prostate. The nature of these defects have important implications for understanding the development of this organ system, as well as beginning to understand potential roles for Hox genes have in disease. Results in the laboratory suggest that Hox11 proteins, together with Pax2 and Eya1, form a regulatory complex that, together can activate downstream genes, such as Six2 and Gdnf in the kidney. Both of these genes are also expressed in the developing prostate, and our preliminary data shows Gdnf functions in the developing prostate, supporting the conservation of this pathway in prostate development. We have also engineered new constructs in the Hox11 paralogous genes that produce null alleles, but also express fluorescently fusion proteins from the endogenous loci. Additionally, as triple mutant and high-allele mutants in the Hox11 colony die at newborn stages due to insufficient kidney development, we have worked out culture conditions that allow us to continue prostatic growth through early ductal morphogenesis. Using our newly generated fluorecent alleles in culture experiments will allow real-time imaging of Hox expression during early prostate organogenesis. We hypothesize that Hox11 paralogous genes contribute to patterning the dorsolateral prostate and their mesenchymal expression is necessary for branching morphogenesis and growth of this region of the developing prostate. These studies will provide key insights into the genetic and molecular basis of Hox regulation in prostate development.

To this end we will mechanistically address the role of the FGFR signaling axis on specific molecular events, focusing on a stringent quantitative approach to elucidate how deregulated FGFR signaling can facilitate and cooperate with the androgen signaling axis (ASX) to control growth and differentiation of the prostate gland and the development and progression of prostate cancer.

Cellular cardiomyoplasty using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been shown to be a viable strategy for limiting LV remodeling following MI and/or regenerating necrotic myocardium. At the same time, there is a growing body of literature to suggest that endogenous mechanisms of stem cell mediated myocardial repair become defective with age and that this may limit the application of cellular cardiomyoplasty to the population most in need. Preliminary results from our group show that MSCs delivered intravenously dramatically improve post-MI structure and function in young, but not old, rats. We propose a series of experiments to study this defect further by characterizing the efficacy of the four primary stem-cell-related treatment strategies in an aging rat model of permanent coronary artery occlusion. We will investigate the following therapies 1) stem cells (MSC) injected intravenously post-MI 2) administration of a cytokine cocktail (G-CSF/SCF) over the first week after MI 3) stem cells plus cytokines delivered simultaneously 4) direct injection of stem cells into the left ventricle immediately after MI. These experiments will help to identify which treatment strategy is most effective in the aging heart. They will also help to identify whether there are age-related defects in stem cell mobilization, homing, engraftment and/or survival. In a second series of experiments we will further investigate these defects at the cellular and molecular level by determine age-related differences in the differentiation of MSCs at the infarct, their anti-apoptotic effects on surrounding tissues and the expression levels of two proposed injury signals (nitric oxide and SDF-1) by the native myocardium. In the last step we will further investigate targets for counter-measures that may be useful in improving MSC engraftment and survival in old animals towards that seen in young. We will test which injury signals are required for MSCs homing and we will conduct a trial using the cytokine erythropoietin to enhance MSC survival at the infarct in old rats. Taken together, our studies will help guide the development of age-specific treatment strategies employing cellular cardiomyoplasty.","284340",

The long-term goal of this proposal is to determine the role of CSF-1 in osteoclast- and monocyte-mediated bone and cartilage destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using animal models and whether inhibition of CSF-1 alone or in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ameliorates the disease. Recently, we identified a -3.3 kb/+183 bp region of the CSF-1 promoter that confers lacZ expression in joint tissues of transgenic mice which will be useful for targeting exogenous genes to joint tissue. Our hypothesis is that CSF-1 acts in concert with VEGF, an angiogenic factor that promotes pannus expansion, to enhance cartilage and bone destruction in RA. Patients with RA show increased levels of CSF-1 and VEGF in synovial tissues and serum. However, whether the soluble (s) and membrane-bound (m) forms of CSF-1 mediate distinct biologic effects in RA is unknown. To address this issue, we will use a knock-out and high throughput knock-in approach to selectively express sCSF-1 or mCSF-1 in mice and examine their effect in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a model that mimics the human counterpart of RA. Optimal management of RA would require inhibition of synovial hyperplasia, cartilage and bone destruction. Our plan is to inhibit CSF-1 and VEGF in the joint microenvironment using soluble CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1 R) and soluble VEGF receptor (FLT-1), thereby preventing the onset and/or ameliorating established arthritis. The efficacy of osteoclast antagonists in combination with anti-angiogenic factors in RA has not been explored. For these studies, transgenic mice carrying the CSF-1 R under the control of the -3.3 kb/+183 bp CSF-1 promoter will be generated and assessed for clinical and histologic severity of CIA. The effect of combined treatment with FLT-1 in CIA will be determined by delivering FLT-1 to the joints of CSF-1 R transgenic mice using adenoviral and retroviral based approaches. These studies should elucidate the role of CSF-1 isoforms and the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting osteoclast activity and angiogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis and perhaps, identify novel strategies for therapeutic intervention in this disorder.","208926",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
The long-term objective of this project is to better define risk factors for age-related bone loss and fractures, For the past 15 years, this research program has focused on three specific themes; 1) fracture epidemiology by establishing the Framingham Fracture Registry, 2) the genetics of bone traits, 3) the influence of dietary factors on the skeleton, including the interaction between genes, diet and other environmental factors on bone density. The next five years will expand on these three themes using both previously collected data as well as new data to be generated. The first aim is to examine the association between lower extremity lean mass and total lean mass, previously measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and the risk for hip and non-vertebral fracture using the Framingham Fracture Registry of the Original and Offspring Cohorts. The second aim is to measure lumbar spine volumetric trabecular bone mineral density (vTBMD) and vertebral cross-sectional area (CSA) using QCT scans of the spine acquired in 3,529 members of the Offspring and 3rd generation Cohorts. These new measurements will be used in aim 3 to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using 3529 subjects from the Offspring and Gen3 Cohorts who will have genotyping data from the ""Framingham Heart Study SNP Health Association Resource"" (FHS SHARe Project) that will provide 550K dense single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genome wide. We will also separately perform a second GWAS on 3507 Original and Offspring participants with DXA measures of areal BMD (aBMD) using the same FHS SHARe Project genotyping data. Following the GWAS analyses using vTBMD and CSA, a staged replication will be performed in two separate cohorts: the Family Heart Study - SCAN (FHS-SCAN) and the AGES Reykjavik Study (AGES). These two cohorts have identical QCT phenotypes and will undertake new genotyping to replicate findings from our GWAS. This staged replication will lead to the identification of the 5 most significant non-overlapping (r2<0.8) SNPs/candidate regions across all three cohorts that will then be further explored with additional genotyping in the Framingham Study. We will also replicate our GWAS results using DXA-derived aBMD phenotypes in silico with results from the identical phenotypes in the Rotterdam Study GWAS. The final aim will be to investigate the interaction of SNPs in four genes related to age-associated accumulation of marrow fat and osteoblast dysfunction (PPAR3, Runx2, HIVEP3, and WWP1) with dietary fat intake on vTBMD, and the interaction of four genes related to methylation pathways (MTHFR, MTR, MTRR, CBS) with plasma folate, vitamin B12 and B6 levels on vTBMD. The findings from this study will provide important new data on the influence of leg muscle mass on fracture risk. This will also be the first GWAS in the U.S. to use dense SNP genotyping data along with state-of-the-art skeletal imaging phenotypes to find genes related to bone density. Finally, using dietary assessments and B-vitamin levels, this study will characterize important potential interactions between genes and nutrients as they affect bone density. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This research is relevant to public health in several ways. First it will determine how muscle mass in the legs contributes to fracture risk. Second it will identify genes as well as nutritional factors such as the B-vitamins and dietary fat that work together to increase the risk for osteoporosis.

New targeted therapies are needed for cancer patients that improve survival and
decrease side-effects of therapy. Ewing's Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) are
highly malignant tumors of bone and soft tissue that occur in children,
adolescents, and young adults. The tumors often grow in close proximity to
bone, but can occur as a soft-tissue mass. Current standard therapy for ESFT
patients is a five-drug regimen that lasts for approximately 9 months. Patients
who present with localized ESFT have approximately 70% disease-free survival.
Patients who present with metastatic ESFT have a poor prognosis (20% disease-
free survival) despite intensive therapy. These clinical response rates have
persisted for the past decade, even after dose-intensifying chemotherapy and
bone marrow transplantation. The identification of a Ewing's Sarcoma Stem Cell
(ESSC) and elucidation of its properties will be critical to advancing both novel
and effective therapies into patients with ESFT. Our identification of ESSC along
with the use of a novel inhibitor of EWS-FLI1 are directly responsive to the RFA-
CA-08-019. This project will specifically address the need for new targeted
therapies for ESFT and potentially a large number of related malignancies that
have chromosomal translocations.","NCI","7623791","9/25/2008 12:00:00 AM","RFA-CA-08-019","1R01CA138212-01","1","R01","CA","138212","01"," ","KOPELOVICH, LEVY","9/25/2008 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","ZCA1-RPRB-O(O2)"," ","6182845","TORETSKY, JEFFREY A","Not Applicable","98","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","049515844","TF2CMKY1HMX9","049515844","TF2CMKY1HMX9","US","38.904729","-77.016304","2869001","GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY","WASHINGTON","DC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","200570001","UNITED STATES","N","9/25/2008 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2008"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","  
DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The ""Cancer Stem Cell Hypothesis"" posits the existence of a scarce stem cell population within each tumor that is resistant to chemotherapy and is responsible for generating and maintaining the bulk tumor population. Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ESFT) typify the response to treatment expected of a tumor driven by cancer stem cells. Current therapies most likely target the stem cells' progeny (the bulk of the tumor) and spare the true cancer stem cells. Consequently, although the majority of patients achieve a remission, relapse is common. ESFT contains a characteristic translocation, t(11:22), which encodes the oncogenic transcription  
factor EWS-FLI1. EWS-FLI1 is thought to drive tumorigenesis, so inhibition of EWS-FLI1 should be an effective treatment strategy. Because EWS-FLI1 lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity, our approach to pharmacologic inhibition is through targeting protein-protein interactions. RNA Helicase A is a critical binding partner of EWSFLI1. We have identified a lead compound, YK-4-279, that blocks EWS-FLI1 interaction with RHA. Furthermore, our preliminary data suggest that a subpopulation within ESFT cell lines with stem-like properties still expresses EWS-FLI1. Therefore, EWS-FLI1 is expected to be a key molecular target in ESFT stem cells. We hypothesize that a drug that blocks the interaction of RHA with EWS-FLI1 will target chemotherapyresistant ESFT stem cells. These studies will provide the necessary preclinical data to justify clinical trials with a compound designed specifically to target ESFT stem cells. The primary objective of this study is to develop a targeted therapy for Ewing's sarcoma stem cells (ESSC). We are proposing an integrative, collaborative research program aimed at the identification and characterization of ESSC which will allow the development of an effective therapeutic strategy to target and eliminate these cells in patients. The first aim of the study is to identify and characterize ESSC. We will employ a variety of assays that have been proposed to identify cancer stem cells, including expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase, dye efflux, the ability to form spherical aggregates under nonadherent conditions, and the expression of characteristic genes. Gene expression profiling will be hypothesis-driven, and will be performed specifically to test the hypothesis that Ewing's sarcoma is derived from the neoplastic transformation of mesenchymal stem cells. We will then demonstrate that inhibition of the EWS-FLI1/RHA interaction is lethal to chemotherapy-resistant ESSC. The final aim of the study is to identify other key signaling pathways that are amenable to small molecule targeting. This will address the possibility that inhibition of EWS-FLI1 activity alone might be insufficient to eliminate ESSC. Simultaneous targeting of multiple signaling pathways is likely to be a substantially more effective therapeutic strategy. We anticipate that at the conclusion of the project, ESSC will have been isolated and sufficiently characterized to allow the development of targeted therapies that can be rapidly translated into clinical trials and dramatically improve the prognosis of patients with Ewing's sarcoma family tumors.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our long-term goal is to determine how cells establish and maintain progressive motility to repopulate tissues in response to external signals. In wound repair, soluble growth factors direct fibroblasts and endothelial cells repopulate the immature matrix to form both the supporting matrix and vasculature required to regenerate the tissue structures. The initial migration is driven by stimulatory cues arising from within the wound bed. However, once within the wound bed, the cells must distribute often in the absence of stimuli gradients. A central question is therefore how cells establish the sustained asymmetry required for progressive migration. Cell migration requires asymmetry of biophysical force-related processes; in eukaryotic cells this is likely governed by intracellular signals. At the front, the cells must extend lamellipodia and form new adhesions to stabilize the dominant protrusion, while rear de-adhesion and retraction is required to enable progressive movement. Between these two cell regions, contractility occurs to bring the cell body forward. To productively choreograph these processes, a cell must establish persistent directionality. During the initial grant period we have found that during motility induced by near ubiquitous chemokinetic EGFR ligands, that the initial actviation of PLCy (phospholipase-Cy) establishes an asymmetry of an important membrane moiety, PIP2 (phosphoinositide bisphosphate). Our preliminary data suggest that the biochemical cascades leading to the biophysical processes are regulated at least in part by this membrane moiety and docking site. Thus, we hypothesize that the localized activation of key biochemical signaling cascades required for productive cell motility results from the integration of phospho-inositide asymmetry in the plasma membrane. We propose to test the following postulates: /. That m-calpain (CAPN2), required for rear release during motility, is localized to an activatable peri-plasma membrane locale by binding to PIP2. II. That PKCS-mediated contractility, required to pull the cell body and tail forward, is localized to regions of PLCy activity linked by phospho-inositide turnover. III. That PI3 kinase designates and stabilizes the leading, dominant lamellipod to provide directionality. We focus on human fibroblasts and endothelial cells, with extension to mesenchymal stem cells. These studies will define molecular bases for spatial restriction of receptor signaling and resultant biophysical responses, offering promise for design of 'smart' scaffolds for tissue engineering to support tissue function.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is designed to develop a non-invasive magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique for monitoring the in vivo viability, homing and engraftment of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) in arthritic knee joints. Central aim will be to show that clinically applicable iron oxide based MR contrast media can be used to label hMSC effectively without impairment of their viability or differentiation capacity and that signal characteristics, provided by these iron oxide contrast media, may be used to diagnose a successful or non-successful hMSC engraftment in arthritic joints. The overall hypothesis is that iron oxide nanoparticles exhibit differences in signal intensity on MR images with respect to different states of biology of the investigated, transplanted stem cells and that these signal differences can be detected and quantified by MR imaging. We hypothesize, that iron oxide based MR contrast agents can yield estimates of the viability of the transplanted cells by differences in the T2-effect of intracellular iron oxides in viable cells and extracellular iron oxides, released from apoptotic cells. In a systematic, step-by-step approach, experiments will be carried out in cell cultures, then ex vivo in pig knees with focal cartilage defects, then in vivo in knee joints of rats with focal cartilage defects and, finally, in vivo in knee joints of rats with an antigen-induced arthritis. Studies are designed to investigate differences in MR signal characteristics of iron oxide nanoparticle labeled viable and apoptotic hMSC in these different experimental models and at different time intervals up to 8 weeks after labeling and/or intraarticular transplantation. Complementary optical imaging studies as well as electron microscopy, confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry and spectrometry studies will be correlated with the MR findings. These data should elucidate biological and physicochemical changes of the investigated cells and iron oxide nanoparticles that influence the observed MR signal characteristics. Results should be immediately helpful in the preclinical assessment of new stem cell based therapies for arthritis treatment, in the design of related clinical trials for hMSC therapy of arthritis, and ultimately, in the assessment of those hMSC therapy regimens in clinical practice.

We have focused our efforts on transcription factors since       they are essential for stem cell growth and differentiation, and are frequently deregulated       during the development of leukemias and lymphomas. We previously found that the helix loop       helix (HLH) transcription factor, inhibitor of differentiation 1 (Id1), is induced during the       early stages of myeloid development, and can instruct hematopoietic stem cells toward a       myeloid versus erythroid and lymphoid cell fate. Furthermore, we discovered that deregulated       expression of Id1 immortalizes hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro, and leads a       myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in vivo. In addition, we       discovered that Id1 and Id2 genes are over expressed in human acute myelogenous leukemia       (AML), and may represent a potential therapeutic target to treat human hematopoietic       malignancies. In this regard, we found that reducing the levels of Id gene expression in human       leukemic cell lines using Id1 siRNA inhibits cell growth in       vitro. Future studies are planned to determine if we can inhibit or promote       the differentiation of AML patient samplesin vitro,       andin vivo when transplanted into severe combined       immuno-deficient (SCID) mice. We have extended these studies to determine if Id1 is required       for normal hematopoietic development using Id1-/- mice. Id-/- mice are viable and show no       obvious defects. However, these mice have hematopoietic phenotypes including increased       hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell cycling and defects in B cell and myeloid cell development.       We determined that the hematopoietic phenotype observed in the Id1-/- mice was not intrinsic       to the Id1-/- hematopoietic cells, but were due to defects in the microenvironment or niche.       We found that stromal cells that lack Id1-/- expression can not support normal hematopoietic       development in long term bone marrow cultures in vitro,       suggesting that Id1 is required for the differentiation or function of the stromal cells. The       Id1-/- stromal cells show altered hematopoietic growth factor (HGF) production including       GM-CSF, SCF, G-CSF, SDF-1, which could explain, in part, the hematopoietic phenotype in Id1-/-       mice. In addition, these mice showed a defect in the number of mesenchymal stem cells, which       suggest that Id1 could also affect the development of specific stromal cell lineages including       osteoblasts and adipocytes. Future experiments are planned to generate Id1 conditional knock       out mice to specifically delete Id1 in endothelial cells, osteoblasts and other stromal cell       populations. In addition, experiments are planned to determine if loss of Id1 gene expression       in the microenvironment could contribute hematopoietic malignancy by promoting the survival       and proliferation of tumor cells (tumor cell       niche).            Id proteins (Id1, Id2 and Id3) have been shown to be negative regulators of lymphoid       development by antagonizing E protein function. However, it is not known if all Id proteins       are physiologically required for lymphocyte development. By analyzing Id2-/- mice we       discovered that Id2 is required for B cell development in       vivo. In addition, we determined that Id2 positively regulates erythroid       development by antagonizing the function of Pu.1. Thus, Id2 regulates lymphoid and erythroid       development via the interaction with different transcription factor target proteins. Future       studies are planned to evaluate the role of Id2 in regulating the survival, proliferation and       self-renewal of HSC.             In       an effort to identify novel transcriptional regulators of myeloid cell growth and       differentiation, we have compared the global gene expression profile of undifferentiated and       differentiating hematopoietic progenitor cells. We have identified a novel zinc finger       transcription factor of unknown function, POGZ, which is down regulated during the early       stages of myeloid development. We have generated a mouse strain with a targeted deletion of       POGZ. POGZ-/- mice do not survive beyond the first few hours of life, and die at birth of       unknown causes, suggesting that POGZ is essential for mouse survival. We have discovered that       fetal liver hematopoietic cell development is impaired in POGZ-/- mice, which includes a       dramatic decrease in cellularity. In addition, fetal thymic development is arrested at a very       early stage of development suggesting that POGZ is required for thymic development. Future       studies are planned to transplant POGZ fetal liver cells into wild type recipient mice to       evaluate the development of the entire hematopoietic system, and to determine if any of the       observed defects are intrinsic to hematopoietic cells. Alternatively, POGZ will be deleted in       adult hematopoietic cells using the POGZ conditional mice established in our lab, and mx1-cre       and vav-cre transgenic mice.","1047533",

We used EGFP (Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) labelled bone marrow to transplant into mice with middle cerebral artery occlusion (stroke model) to study the contribution of BM derived cells to tissue repair. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF) induces proliferation of bone marrow derived cells. G-CSF is neuroprotective after experimental brain injury, but the mechanisms involved remain unclear. Stem cell factor (SCF) is a cytokine important for the survival and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. Its receptor (ckit or CD117) is present in some endothelial cells. We aimed to determine whether the combination of G-CSF/SCF induces angiogenesis in the central nervous system by promoting entry of endothelial precursors into the injured brain and causing them to proliferate there. We induced permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in female mice that previously underwent sex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation from enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expressing mice. G-CSF/SCF treatment reduced infarct volumes by more than 50% and resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in vessel formation in mice with stroke, a large percentage of which contain endothelial cells of bone marrow origin. Most cells entering the brain maintained their bone marrow identity and did not trans-differentiate into neural cells. G-CSF/SCF treatment also led to a 2-fold increase in the number of newborn cells in the ischemic hemisphere. These findings suggest that G-CSF/SCF treatment might help recovery through induction of bone marrow derived angiogenesis, thus improving neuronal survival and functional outcome.

        2.  We have initiated several studies to examine the effect of intravenously injected bone marrow stromal cells in disease models.  We used CLP (cecal ligation and puncture) to induce sepsis in mice.  Acute kidney injury (AKI) in septic shock is associated with a high mortality in ICU patients. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), which are often referred to as mesenchymal stem cells, have been shown to improve outcome in a number of different animal injury models by altering inflammation, apoptosis, and necrosis. In this study we set out to determine whether BMSCs can attenuate the severity of sepsis-induced AKI. Sepsis was induced in C57/BL6 mice using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). BMSCs were obtained from the bone marrow of 6-8 week old mice.  Intravenous administration of BMSCs (1 million cells/mouse) immediately before CLP surgery resulted in significantly longer survival and improved kidney, liver and pancreatic function. Such organ protection was not obtained with either hematopoietic stem cells or necrotic BMSCs. Searching for a mechanism of action, we found that 24 hours after CLP the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-6), peritoneal and kidney vascular permeability, splenic apoptosis and blood bacterial count were significantly reduced in BMSC-treated animals vs controls;  the level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was not affected. Six hours after their injection, fluorescently-labeled BMSCs were detected mostly in the lung.  By prelabeling BMSCs with quantum dots and later performing immunostaining with a macrophage marker (Iba-1), we found the BMSCs adjacent to macrophages in the lung.  Some were in the spleen, and rare cells were seen in the kidney; 24 hours after they were injected, we found few BMSCs in any organ. The positive effect of BMSC treatment was still present in Rag-/- mice; in NK cell depleted mice, and in IFN-&#947; -/- mice, suggesting that B,T and NK cells, and IFN-&#947; do not play a significant role in mediating the effects of the BMSCs. On the other hand, macrophage depletion or pretreatment with IL-10 or IL10 receptor antibodies eliminated the beneficial effects of BMSCs in the sepsis model. Our results suggest that BMSCs may act on tissue macrophages resulting in enhanced production of IL-10, a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine.","901122",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Matrix-induced Myogenesis & Pharmaco-Screens of MSCs Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) are capable of differentiating into many tissue lineages, including muscle, leading to the belief that such cells contribute to homeostatic repair processes. In many diseases, including muscular dystrophies, tissue matrix is abnormal and progenitor contributions to repair are inadequate. Our goal is to develop tissue-mimetic cell culture models of normal and diseased myogenesis, focused on the influence of normal and abnormal matrix elasticity, in order to assess known drugs (eg. Prednisolone) and ultimately screen an NIH library for drug candidates that steer matrix-coupled myogenesis of stem cells. As a specific disease, we also focus on nucleo-dystrophies because of relevance to muscle and also for deeper insight into differentiation mechanisms. The nuclear lamina interacts with chromatin and   through linker proteins that span the envelope   the lamina also interacts with the cytoskeleton. We have shown recently that the cytoskeleton is strongly influenced by matrix elasticity in acto-myosin striation of skeletal muscle cells [Engler J. Cell Biology 2004] as well as in multi-lineage differentiation of MSCs [Engler Cell 2006]. Adhesion to matrix physically couples to myosin-based contractility in these cells and most other tissue cells, and so a linkage is formed from the matrix through the cytoskeleton and into the normal nucleus. This continuous linkage from nucleus~cytoskeleton~matrix makes MATRIX ELASTICITY A CRITICAL BIOLOGICAL INPUT. This R21's ""develop and explore"" objectives will therefore (1) adapt our elastic matrices to both low & high throughput screening formats and eventually screen for novel myo-differentiation inducers on normal human MSC on abnormal matrix (that mechanically mimics fibrosis), and will (2) develop a myogenic disease model both for the screen and to test the hypothesis that nuclear defects strongly influence myogenic differentiation and nuclear plasticity. In just serum media, we will use matrix elasticity to control myogenic differentiation of normal MSC and also, importantly, to mimic rigid and fibrotic tissues typical in disease. The same matrix system allows comparisons to osteogenesis on rigid matrices and neurogenesis on soft, brain- mimetic matrices. Soluble induction factors (eg. glucocorticoids) that enhance or inhibit the lineages will be screened and studied for safety & efficacy with a particular goal to promote myogenesis. We will also engineer human MSC to express known dystrophy causing mutants such as those in Lamin-A/C, while knocking down endogenous protein to minimize over-expression artifacts. With select differentiated states and nuclear mutants treated with lead drugs from the screen, insights into protein folding and association state of nuclear components such as lamins within the intact cell will be probed by a novel proteomic-scale Cys Shotgun labeling strategy that exploits quantitative Mass Spectrometry methods [Johnson 2007].   
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop an elastic matrix culture format for multi-well screens of soluble factors that influence myogensis of adult-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The various elastic matrices mimic the influential variation of tissue mechanical properties in normal and diseased states. We will apply the screen to normal human stem cells on abnormal matrices (that mechanically mimic fibrosis), and ultimately to re- engineered cells expressing known muscular dystrophy-causing mutants such as those in Lamin-A/C. A goal will be to understand mechanistic blocks to differentiation and also to screen known compounds and eventually libraries that over-ride matrix signals and promote differentiation in diseased cells.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a five-year training program to develop an academic career in Medical Genetics and gene therapy. The program will further advance the investigator's research in the development of an AAV-mediated gene targeting strategy for the treatment of Osteogenesis Imperfecta. The investigator will be mentored by Dr. David Russell, well recognized for his achievements in developing the adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector system for gene targeting. Osteogenesis Imperfecta (01) is a group of inherited collagen disorders characterized by bone fragility with clinical manifestations varying from a mild increase in fractures to severe bone deformities and death. Mutations that cause Ol are located in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes. Current treatment options are limited and do not alleviate the complications seen in Ol. Most gene therapy systems involve the process of gene addition, where a promoter and a gene are delivered into a cell and integrate randomly. In contrast, gene targeting uses homologous sequences to alter the cell's endogenous genes in a site specific manner. By this method mutated genes can be either ""knocked-out"" or corrected. The major advantage of gene targeting is that genes can be modified at their proper location on the chromosme without disrupting cellular gene regulation. Previous work by Dr. Russell has demonstrated that an AAV-mediated gene targeting vector can target the COL1A1 gene and disrupt dominant negative mutant procollagen production. It was shown that the loss of the mutant protein improved the processing, stability and structure of the collagen fibril. The objective of this proposal is to develop an AAV gene targeting vector that will target the COL1A2 gene, reduce random integration, and target multiple individuals with Ol. The specific aims include: 1) Develop an AAV gene-targeting vector to target the COL1A2 gene in Ol; 2) Develop an improved AAV gene-targeting vector to reduce the recovery of random integrants; and 3) Determine the effects of human variation on gene targeting.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is accumulating enthusiasm and experimental support for repairing damaged cardiac tissue using cell- based therapies. One of the most promising cell sources, supported by substantial pre-clinical data, is bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We have shown that MSCs ameliorate the damage induced by anterior wall myocardial infarction (Ml) in a pig model of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Of great clinical relevance, MSCs may be administered as an allogeneic graft and have received FDA approval to be studied for acute Ml. Several critical mechanistic issues require study in order to rationally advance the clinical development of MSCs as a therapy for acute and chronic cardiac injury. This program of work will examine a series of hypotheses regarding the mechanism of action of MSCs as an agent of cardiac repair. In aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that MSCs stimulate cardiac repair by several mechanisms, including stimulation of endogenous repair mechanisms. We will utilize a well-established porcine model of Ml and administer GFP labeled MSCs. Cardiac repair will be monitored with cardiac MRI and multi-detector CT and cardiac tissue will be submitted to confocal microscopy to quantify cell engraftment, differentiation, and the proliferation of endogenous cell sources. Aim 2 will address several critical issues regarding MSC therapy. We will compare autologous and allogeneic MSCs both at functional and molecular/cellular levels to address whether allogeneic cells are equivalent to autologous cells as an agent of cardiac repair. Additionally, we will test the hypothesis that MSCs are superior to whole bone marrow mononuclear preparations, and finally we will assess various cell delivery methods. In aim 3, we will perform studies in 2 established heart failure (HF) models - chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and pacing induced HF. MSC efficacy in chronic HF will be assessed using comprehensive evaluation of myocardial performance including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), hemodynamic pressure-volume catheterization, and electrophysiology testing. The results of this aim have the potential to broaden the patient population eligible to receive cellular myoplasty. Together, these experiments will advance the translational and mechanistic understanding of cellular myoplasty using MSCs and evaluate whether these cells represent a novel treatment for a wide range of acute and chronic structural heart disease.

In response, the tumor provides growth factors, cytokines, and cellular signals that continually initiate new stromal reactions and recruit new cells into the microenvironment to further support tumor growth. It is not fully understood how stroma influences the neoplastic cells, but there is evidence for involvement of soluble paracrine factors, extracellular matrix formation, and direct cell-to-cell interaction. Therefore, it might be possible to manipulate the tissue stroma cells and thereby interfere with the stroma-tumor interactions for therapeutic benefit. The prerequisite for this approach is that stromal cells be accessible to therapeutic manipulation. We have previously demonstrated that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) integrate into solid tumors as stromal elements and contribute to the development of tumors. Importantly, MSC are precursors of structural and supportive tissues and have been implicated in the repair of damaged tissues and in wound healing. Of interest is that the tumor microenvironment appears to exhibit cytokine profiles and cellular signals similar to those characteristics of wounded or damaged tissues. Given this, we hypothesized that MSC would home to and selectively proliferate in the tumor microenvironment and that gene-modified MSC could be used as cellular vehicles to deliver gene products into tumors. Preliminary data suggests that MSC home to and participate in tumor stroma formation in both subcutaneous and metastatic tumor xenografts in mice. Additionally, once homed to tumor beds, MSC proliferate rapidly and integrate. Migration assays have identified apoptotic cells as a potent attractant of MSC in vitro. Our proposed studies aim at understanding the factors that influence MSC homing and selective proliferation in the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, our goals focus on optimizing the cellular delivery of therapeutic genes into the stroma of metastatic and subcutaneous tumor xenografts. 
Specific Aim 1: To determine the biodistribution and selective proliferation of intravenously administered MSC in the stromal microenvironment, to identify cellular mediators that may enhance the selective proliferation and engraftment of MSC, and determine the phenotype and fate of MSC that have engrafted and proliferated in the tumor microenvironment.   
Specific Aim 2: To investigate the tumor targeting ability and normal distribution of MSC in vivo utilizing noninvasive imaging techniques.  
Specific Aim 3: To determine which of several viral gene delivery systems + MSC results in optimal tumor growth inhibition and cell killing. Additionally, to determine the effect of MSC + vector specifically targeted to breast cancer or metastatic melanoma in vivo, on the growth of tumors in immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice.","183473",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term goals are to develop non-hematopoietic cellular approaches to improve bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for the treatment of non-malignant and malignant disorders. We will test 2 non-hematopoietic cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into multiple non-hematopoietic lineages, inhibit in vitro allogeneic T cell responses and are being tested clinically to reduce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Much remains unknown about their immune suppressive and multi-organ system regenerative potential. In aim 1, we hypothesize that infused mMSCs will suppress allogeneic T cell responses that generate GVHD and BM graft rejection. We will determine the responsible mechanism(s) and whether suppression is alloantigen-specific or non-specific, findings that have clinical implications. We hypothesize that mMSCs will contribute to post-BMT regeneration of GVHD organs and regimen-related toxicity (RRT). MAPCs are multipotent progenitor cells that can be induced to differentiate into endodermal, mesodermal, or ectodermal lineages. We hypothesize that MAPCs may be superior to MSCs in tissue regeneration post-BMT by their broad tissue differentiation. MAPCs also suppress in vitro allogeneic responses. We hypothesize that MSCs may be superior to MAPCs for suppression in vivo. BMT injury from RRT or GVHD may benefit from MSCs or MAPCs. Tissue injury can occur in storage disorders. Mucopolysaccaridosis type IH (MPS IH) (Hurler syndrome) is caused by (-L-iduronidase (IDUA) enzyme deficiency. Although BMT reduces some symptoms, the CNS, cardiac and bone are more recalcitrant to correction. We hypothesize that MSCs or MAPCs may be additive with BMT in correcting MPSIH recipients since both populations can give rise to bone, cartilage and pulmonary cells. We hypothesize that MAPCs may be superior to MSCs for use in MPSIH by their in vivo differentiation potential to cardiac cells and into CNS cells after systemic injection in adult rodents. We will test these in a congeneic and then allogeneic BMT model.

The gel environment will be tailored to provide localized signals to induce osteogenesis, maintain cell function and promote mineralization, and lead to integration with the native tissue. Within the hydrogel carrier, we plan to design 3D scaffold chemistries that support hMSC viability and proliferation (aim 1), osteogenic differentiation (aim 2), and mineralized tissue formation (aim 3). We hypothesize that three factors will be important in this design. First, we aim to tune the macroscopic hydrogel properties including water content, mesh size, and degradation rate to support 3D hMSC culture. Second, we propose that the composition of the extracellular hydrogel environment and localized presentation of osteogenic factors will induce hMSC differentiation to osteoblasts. Third, we will manipulate the gel degradation mechanism (i.e., hydrolytic vs proteolytic) and rate, as well as introduce mineralization nucleators, to facilitate neotissue evolution. The experimental approach for each aim will be to photoencapsulate hMSCs in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels. BRDU incorporation and gene expression with time, as determined by real time RT-PCR, immunostaining, and in situ hybrization, will be used to assess hMSC cell proliferation and differentiation. Functional activity of differentiated hMSCs will be assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium deposition, and extracellular matrix formation. Effects of gel chemistry, especially the introduction of osteogenic epitopes and mineralization nucleators, on hMSC function will be screened by culturing cell-laden hydrogels in vitro. The gel provides a three dimensional environment that is easily controlled to mimic critical aspects of bone extracellular space during fracture healing. Results from these aims will be used to identify hydrogel formulations that permit hMSC function, promote osteogenic differentiation, and facilitate mineralized tissue formation. These in vitro results will then provide the foundation to select formulations for testing in an animal model of bone regeneration in a critical-sized rat calvaria defect (aim 4).","320840",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis is one of the most common diseases suffered by elderly persons in Western countries. This disabling joint disorder is usually multifactorial in nature and thus of unknown origin in individual cases. During the early stages of osteoarthritis, localized lesioning of the articular cartilage layer is a characteristic occurrence. Once initiated, this lesioning process is progressive, and no prophylactic measures are available to arrest it. Likewise, no established biologically-based treatment strategies are available to induce the healing of these structural defects. Endeavours are now being made to adopt a more biologically rational approach to the repair of articular cartilage lesions using tissue-engineering principles. We have recently developed a growth-factor-based strategy which induces the healing of small articular cartilage defects. But when applied to very large defects in experimental animals (goats), the same strategy is unable to induce their repair within a short period of time. - We postulate that by introducing an adult stem cell population directly into the defect space by the autotransplantation of synovial membrane flaps, the difficulties can be overcome and the repair of large defect areas and volumes induced. We hypothesize that a ""layered synovioplasty"" performed in a single intervention (surgery or arthroscopy) can form the basis for the repair of bulk volume articular cartilage defects. Layers of synovial flaps will be interposed with a matrix containing growth factors in a controlled release system, which will assure their transformation. - We will first optimize the transformation conditions using a tissue-culture system based on the availability of fresh synovial bovine tissue (from young adult cows). - We also hypothesize that adult stem cell populations within different synovial joints of the body contain positional information respecting their differentiation potential into joint- specific articular cartilage. This being the case, the local recruitment of adult synovial stem cells would be a great advantage, in that the cells would carry local positional information to form the same type of joint-specific articular cartilage. We will test this hypothesis using articular cartilage tissue as well as synovial tissue from three different bovine joints that differ significantly both structurally and functionally, i.e., from the shoulder joint, from the knee joint and from the metatarsal joint of bovine origin. - Following fine-tuning, the optimized protocols will be cross- checked in vitro using adult goat material derived from the knee joint. The finalized protocols will be tested at mid- term (5 weeks post-operatively) and long-term (6 months post-operatively) junctures in adult goats. The repair tissue will be analyzed quantitatively with respect to mRNA expression profiles and the post-translational expression of cartilage matrix components, as well as morphometrically, ultrastructurally and biomechanically. We believe that this project is highly innovative and that the results of this research will have a significant impact on the future treatment of osteoarthritic lesions and on improvement of the health status of the US population.

developmental stages until death. It is well established that the lens capsule is crucial for lens development
and function and lens capsule pathologies can threaten vision. An established function of the lens capsule is
to serve as a selectable filter between the lens and the ocular environment, however, relatively little is known
about the properties of this filter. During the prior grant cycle, we developed a robust fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching (FRAP) protocol which can evaluate both the ability of molecules to enter the lens
capsule and quantitatively determine their diffusion coefficient. In the first aim of this application, we propose
to use FRAP to elucidate the molecular properties of the normal lens capsule filter. It is also known that
mutations in extracellular matrix (ECM) protein genes result in cataract. The second aim tests the hypothesis
that alterations in collagen IV activate the unfolded protein response leading to cataract. Another
established function of the lens capsule is to engage ECM receptors on lens cells, providing both a structural
anchor for the cell and inducing cell signaling cascades crucial for lens cell phenotype. Integrins are a major
class of ECM receptors present on lens cells and (31 integrin is the major p-integrin subunit expressed by the
lens. In the prior grant cycle, we created mice lacking pi integrin in either all lens cells or just lens fibers to
test the hypothesis that pi -integrin is important for lens cell/lens capsule communication. The phenotypes of
the resulting animals are quite distinct and we now propose in specific aim three to elucidate the function of
pi-integrin in the in vivo lens by analyzing the molecular abnormalities seen in these animals.
Public Health Relevance: The lens capsule is important for the function of the normal ocular lens, although
little is known about how diseases affecting the lens capsule result in lens abnormalities. Further, the lens
capsule is usually retained in the eye after the surgical removal of cataracts to both support the implanted
artificial replacement lens and to serve as a barrier,between the anterior and posterior portions of the eye,
although the resulting abnormal lens cell/capsule interactions often result in secondary cataract. A complete

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drosophila's Dorsal Closure is a model system for cell sheet morphogenesis during development and wound healing. We plan to investigate the molecular, cellular, and emergent properties that drive morphogenesis during closure using biophysical (laser microsurgery), genetic, pharmacological and modeling approaches. Previously, we showed that nonmuscle myosin II drives contractility in the amnioserosa and in the supracellular, actomyosin-rich purse-strings and that both tissues drive the bulk of progress toward closure. In addition we showed that the tissue forces are coordinated by adhesion- mediated zipping, that there is an asymmetry between the anterior and posterior zipping rate constants, and that the zipping rate constant can be upregulated in response to laser perturbation. We also showed that the removal of one or another force leads to upregulation of the forces that remain and closure proceeds to completion at wild type rates. Furthermore, the upregulation of the amnioserosa force and the zipping rate constant together address the robustness and resiliency of closure. Finally, we showed that the vector sum of the forces that drive closure is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the individual forces that contribute. This indicates that regulation of these large forces is required so that cell sheets move inexorably to closure. Here we focus on applying laser-surgical, pharmacological and quantitative-modeling tools to explore the emergent properties that are the consequence of the cellular and molecular machines that drive cell sheet morphogenesis in wild type and mutant animals. By applying these methods to the analysis of wild type embryos an selected mutant embryos that fail in on or another aspect of closure, we plan the following. 1) We will investigate the hypotheses that mechanically gated channels and/or cell-matrix and cell-cell junctions sense and respond to forces to regulate the rate of closure. 2) We will measure the absolute magnitude of the forces each tissue contributes to closure. 3)We will investigate the role of microtubules in regulating actin function for closure. 4) We will formulate mathematical models that recapitulate at tissue and/or cellular resolution the behavior of closure in mutant, pharmacologically perturbed or laser investigated embryos. These studies on cell sheet morphogenesis in Drosophila will provide insight into the cellular and molecular basis for the biological processes that coordinate cell shape changes in vertebrate morphogenesis and wound healing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This work focuses on dorsal closure, a process in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster that models cell sheet movements in vertebrates. Drosophila offers unique opportunities for multidisciplinary approaches and many of the proteins involved in movement are highly conserved between flies and humans (some are > 90% identical and many human proteins can experimentally rescue genetic defects in their fly orthologs). In addition, comparable sheet movements characterize early stages of human development (for example, neural tube formation) and wound healing. Moreover, the programmed interplay between cell-cell junctions and cell-matrix junctions that occurs during closure is crucial for the epidermal-mesenchymal transition that is activated when epithelial cells become metastatic and cause cancer. These studies in Drosophila will provide insight into the molecular and cellular basis of motility and provide a window onto the emergent behaviors that characterize morphogenesis and wound healing.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cleft palate, the most common craniofacial deformity in the USA, may caused by a failure of palatal medial edge seam (MES) cells to undergo complete disintegration, which is necessary in establishing confluence of the palatal stroma. While, Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) (-1, 2 and 3 are involved in palatogenesis, interestingly, TGF(3 is the only member of this family that is involved in palatal seam disintegration. TGF(3 signaling initiates and completes sequential phases of cellular differentiation that is required during MES disintegration, which progress between 14 to 17 embryonic days in the murine system. Understanding the cellular mechanism of palatal MES disintegration in response to TGF(3 signaling will result in new approaches to defining the causes of cleft palate and other facial clefts that may result from failure of seam disintegration. We have isolated MES primary cells to study the details of TGF(3 signaling mechanisms during palate development. To elucidate the mechanisms of MES disintegration by TGF(3, using several biochemical and genetic approaches, we demonstrated a novel mechanism of MES disintegration where MES undergoes cell cycle arrest, cell migration and apoptosis chronologically to generate immaculate palatal confluency during palatogenesis. We have shown that robust TGF(3 signaling induces both Smad dependent and Smad independent pathways to activate many transcription factors such as Snail, Slug, SIP1 and LEF1. It is unclear how these pathways and activated transcription factors promote cell cycle arrest, cell migration and apoptosis in the same cell type. We, therefore, wish to further study the mechanisms and diversity of TGF(3 signaling in MES cell function and how they are related to differential transcription factors and pathways to cause controlled MES disintegration. In this proposal, we would like to examine TGF(3 signaling towards these three individual cell functions. The broad objective of this grant is to understand the tissue transitions involved in the development of the palate and craniofacial mesenchyme in response to TGF( signaling. Each specific aim in the proposed study is designed to analyze the three phenotypical changes triggered by TGF(3, such as cell cycle arrest (Aim #1), migration (Aim #2) and apoptosis (Aim #3) required for MES disintegration to generate structural and functional component of the confluent palate. The rationale for this study is that successful completion of the proposed research will contribute to a missing, fundamental element to our base knowledge about the diverse functions of TGF(3 without which the cell cycle arrest, migration and apoptosis during MES disintegration cannot be understood. We believe that in some cases, knowledge of the basic cell biology will lead to more effective treatment of facial clefting.

of EGF receptor (EGFR) ligands in the context of polarized epithelial cells. TGFa and amphiregulin (AR) are
delivered preferentially to the basolateral surface where they are cleaved by TACE/ADAM-17. Mature
soluble TGFa then is avidly taken up by basolaterally restricted EGFRs. We have identified and
characterized two TGFa cytoplasmic tail-interacting proteins (Naked2 and MAGI-3) that regulate,
respectively, the fidelity and efficiency of TGFa delivery to the basolateral surface. Naked2 associates with
TGFa-containing exocytic vesicles as they emerge from the Golgi, and escorts these vesicles to the
basolateral plasma membrane where they dock and fuse in a Naked2 myristoylation-dependent manner.
Functional Naked2 appears to be required for the proper basolateral delivery of TGFa since TGFa is
""trapped"" in the cytoplasm of myristoylation-deficient Naked2-expressing cells. Full length Naked2 protein is
downregulated in colorectal cancer where TGFa immunostaining is often cytoplasmic. Studies are proposed
to further examine the function of Naked2 and MAGI-3, and to test the hypothesis that trafficking of TGFa in
polarized epithelial cells correlates with the oncogenic potential of an epithelial cell in that proper basolateral
trafficking of TGFa contributes to the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis whereas aberrant trafficking of
TGFa is tumor-promoting.
In contrast to TGFa, AR is delivered to the basolateral surface in a Naked2-independent manner. AR binds
basolateral EGFRs but less avidly than TGFa. Exogenous AR, but not TGFa, disrupts epithelial junctional
integrity leading to an epithelial to mesenchymal-like transition. We hypothesize that a consequence of
impaired delivery of TGFa to the basolateral surface is that AR binds ""unoccupied"" basolateral EGFRs,
perturbs epithelial polarity and predisposes the cell to tumor progression. Based on our success in identifying
proteins that functionally interact with the cytoplasmic tail of TGFa, we propose to conduct a similar analysis
with the cytoplasmic tail of AR.
Overall, these studies will elucidate mechanisms underlying the delivery of TGFa and AR to the basolateral
surface of polarized epithelial cells, enhance our understanding of the role of these two EGFR ligands in
epithelial cell biology and lead to important insights into the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and provide
novel, more effective ways to diagnose and treat this disease.","556959",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): COUP-TFII is an orphan nuclear receptor that belongs to the steroid receptor superfamily. Ablation of COUP-TFII in mice results in early embryonic lethality due to defects in angiogenesis and heart development. To further understand the biological functions of COUP-TFII in vascular and heart development, LacZ knock-in and floxed COUP-TFII mice were generated. X-Gal staining of the LacZ knock-in mice shows high COUP-TFII expression in the endothelium of the vein but not in the artery. Further, chimera analysis showed that COUP-TFII plays a cell autonomous function in the endothelial cells of the vein but not the artery. These studies show for the first time that COUP-TFII is an essential transcription factor for vein identify. The insertion of loxP site into the COUP-TFII locus reduced the expression of COUP-TFII, rendering the COUP-TFII flox/- mutants genetically hypomorphic. The hypomorphic mutants exhibit atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD) commonly observed in congenital heart disease patients. The atrium malformation displayed by the COUP-TFII null mutant coupled with AVSD elicited by the hypomorphic mutant together suggest that COUP-TFII plays a critical role in cardiogenesis. Whether the heart defects are intrinsic or secondary to the vascular defects is currently unknown. Proper heart development requires the coordinated interactions between the endocardium and myocardium. Whether the endothelial cells in the endocardium or the myocardial cells in the myocardium are the targets of COUP-TFII regulation is also unclear. To elucidate the role of COUP-TFII in the maintenance of vein identity and in heart development, two Specific Aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will employ gain-of-function and loss-of-function of COUP-TFII in the endothelial cells to examine the role of COUP-TFII in the maintenance of arteriovenous identity. In addition, we will use DMA chip microarray analysis to identify novel downstream targets and signaling pathways that are regulated by COUP-TFII in the arteriovenous decision. In Aim 2, we will use the hypomorphic mutant and the endothelial and myocardial conditional COUP-TFII knockouts to investigate the role of COUP-TFII in heart development. This study will enable us to determine how endothelial COUP-TFII versus myocardial COUP-TFII affects cardiogenesis and how COUP-TFII modulates the interaction between the myocardium and endocardium. Our proposed studies should provide timely new insights into how COUP-TFII impacts cardiovascular development and facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart disease.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital cardiac malformations are the most common birth defects in humans affecting about 1 in 100 newborns. While recent studies both in mice and in humans have identified several different signaling processes and transcriptional regulators that are required for appropriate cardiac development, very little is still known about interactions between these factors during heart morphogenesis, and about pathogenetic mechanisms leading to the congenital heart disease (CHD) in humans. We have previously demonstrated that the BMP type I receptor Alk2 plays a critical role both in cardiac neural crest cells as well as in endocardial cells regulating aortico-pulmonary septation and endocardial transformation (EndMT), while other investigators have demonstrated that another type I receptor mediating BMP signaling called Alk3 is playing a critical non-redundant role in cardiac outflow tract septation and endocardial transformation as well. Moreover, we have recently discovered mutations in the coding region of Alk2 and Alk3 genes in human patients suffering from CHD. However, it is currently not known, how Alk2 and Alk3-mediated BMP signaling pathways interact and cooperate with each other to regulate EndMT and how TGF-2 signaling via Alk5 is coordinated with BMP signaling in this process. In this proposal I want to test the central hypothesis that that concerted action of TGF-2 and BMP signaling is required for appropriate endocardial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EndMT) during mammalian cardiac development. In aim 1 we propose to determine the collaborative signaling via the BMP type I receptors Alk2, Alk3 in EndMT and endocardial cushion development, and in aim 2 we propose to test whether signaling via the TGF-2-type I receptor Alk5 is critical for BMP-induced endocardial EMT. Our unique experimental models and state-of-art strategy will allow us to determine the role Tgf-2/Bmp signaling in EMT during cardiac development. Collectively, the proposed experiments are likely to be of critical importance in attempting to understand the molecular bases of endocardial defects in humans, and may ultimately allow us to develop possible preventive and/or therapeutic approaches to treat congenital cardiac defects during the fetal period and to identify new therapeutic targets to treat heart disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congenital cardiac malformations are the most common birth defects in humans affecting about 1 in 100 newborns. The proposed studies dissect the role of specific signaling mechanisms via the so called type I receptors of bone morphogenetic proteins in cardiac morphogenesis, particularly in the development of atrio-ventricular (AV) canal, which gives raise to AV valves and septa. We expect that the proposed studies will be important for understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to congenital cardiac malformations in humans.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goals of this project are to gain insight into the role of Wnt-4 signaling during cutaneous wound healing and to provide the principal investigator, Anne Hocking with the scientific tools and career development necessary for a successful career as independent investigator in the field of wound healing. During the next three years, Dr. Hocking will follow a research career development plan consisting of a program of educational classes in career skills required for an independent researcher and a laboratory based research project under the guidance of a advisory committee comprised of Dr. Frank Isik (Mentor), Dr Randall Moon (Mentor), and Dr. Nicole Gibran (Advisor) at the University of Washington and Dr. William Carter (Advisor) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Cutaneous wound healing is imperfect in adult mammals. Healed skin lacks epidermal appendages such as hair follicles, sweat and sebaceous glands which can result in problems with thermal regulation and desiccation. Scarring can also be disfiguring, diminish tensile strength and cause contraction which may limit mobility. In addition, abnormal wound healing can cause complications such as hypertrophic scarring and chronic wounds that fail to heal. In order to develop therapies to improve adult wound healing it is necessary to understand the role of cell signaling pathways in the coordination of cell proliferation, migration and biosynthesis of new extracellular matrix during cutaneous wound healing. Therefore, Dr. Hocking proposes to address the functional consequence of the up-regulation of Wnt-4 signaling during wound healing with the following specific aims: 1) determine the temporal and spatial regulation of Wnt-4 expression during cutaneous wound healing; 2) determine if Wnt-4 regulates dermal fibroblast proliferation, migration and biosynthesis of extracellular matrix during cutaneous wound repair; and 3) determine if Wnt-4 regulates keratinocyte proliferation and migration in the cutaneous wound. The significance of this application is that it will improve our understanding of how cell signaling coordinates the cellular processes required for wound healing and may suggest novel therapies to improve adult wound healing.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
Although adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are being used routinely in clinical transplantation, the lack of a suitable source of donor cells remains a major limiting factor depriving many patients of this potentially curative treatment. The ultimate goal of the Principal Investigator is to generate HSCs from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) as a novel source of cells suitable for clinical transplantation. We are proposing an intensive research program to study the developmental biology of hematopoiesis from rhesus ESCs, and to establish the rhesus macaque model as a relevant pre-clinical large animal model for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of ESCderived HSCs. Using methodologies such as co-culturing with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) of murine bone marrow origin, non-human primate and human ESCs have been differentiated into primitive hematopoietic cells as defined by surrogate in vitro assays. However, those derived cells have been shown to possess only limited in vivo engraftment potential upon transplantation into NOD/SCID immunodeficient mice. Our underlying hypothesis is that by providing the appropriate extrinsic and intrinsic inductive mechanisms that play critical roles in embryonic hematopoiesis, we can effectively recapitulate those processes in vitro and thus promote the efficient differentiation of rhesus ESCs into HSCs that will be capable of engraftment and long-term hematopoietic reconstitution in vivo. In aim-1 we will generate MSC cells from rhesus ESCs and will test their potential as a hematopoietic supportive microenvironment in coculture experiments for the generation of HSCs from rhesus ESCs. In aim-2 we will test our hypothesis that the over-expression of HOXB4, a transcription factor which plays a key role in embryonic hematopoiesis, in rhesus ESCs via gene transfer, or the exogenous delivery of the HOXB4 protein, can improve the efficiency of their differentiation into HSCs. In aim-3 we will assess the in vivo engraftment potential of hematopoietic cells derived from rhesus ESCs alone or when co-transplanted with rhesus ESC-derived MSCs into NOD/SCID mice as we hypothesize that the co-transplantation of rhesus ESC-derived MSCs would potentially provide an appropriate niche and thus enhance the in vivo engraftment potential of rhesus ESCderived HSCs. The results of these proposed studies would help us to design a rational approach toward moving such cells into actual rhesus transplantation experiments. Embryonic stem cells have the potential to generate an unlimited number of diverse differentiated cells for human therapeutic applications including hematopoietic stem cells. We are proposing to develop a rhesus monkey transplantation model to study the efficacy and safety of such cells as they should be carefully tested in appropriate pre-clinical animal models before being moved into human clinical applications.

This problem lies at the heart of how pattern is generated in       the embryo and, conversely, how pattern is disrupted when these processes are damaged as in       tumor formation. The developing limb is an ideal system to address these problems because a       wealth of data exists concerning limb development due to studies in genetics and experimental       embryology. Previously, we have shown an essential role for Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF)       signaling during limb development by examining mice lacking genes that encode FGF ligands       (Lewandoski et al. 2000 Nature Genetics 28:167, Sun et al       2000 Nature Genetics 25: 6 ). However, the complexity       caused by Fgf gene redundancy has led us to consider       approaching the problem by examining FGF receptor mutants leading to the insight that FGF       signaling controls limb size (Verheyden et al       2005Development 132:4235). Signaling through the pathway       governed by Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) is thought to play a role in all aspects of       limb outgrowth: early patterning in all three axes, programmed cell death and bone formation.       The task before us is to understand how BMP and FGF signaling pathways interact during limb       development. One process that BMP are thought to play a direct role in is as effectors of       normal programmed cell death that occurs in mesenchymal interdigit cells, thus removing them       and sculpting the final digit pattern in animals that are born without webbed limbs. However,       we have challenged this paradigm in our recent publication (Pajni-Underwood S. et al 2007       Development 134: 2359). By simultaneously inactivating the       Bmp receptor gene, Bmpr1a as well as       Fgf8 and Fgf4       specifically in the limb bud ectoderm, we have produced genetic evidence for a novel model in       which the surface ectoderm must receive a BMP signal, resulting in down regulation of       Fgfs which in turn induces apoptosis of the underlying       mesenchyme (Pajni-Underwood S. et al 2007 Development 134:       2359). Thus we demonstrated that BMPs control programmed cell death indirectly, by regulating       FGF signaling. We have extended these studies by studying the role of BMP and FGF signaling in       various aspects of limb development using mouse lines that express Cre in specific region of       the developing limb. For example the only way to test the hypothesis that BMPs act as direct       effectors of cell death is to inactivate BMPs receptors only in the lineage that undergoes       cells death, without affecting FGF expression in nearby cells. We have achieved this using new       Cre lines that allow Cre-mediated gene inactivation in these lineages. With these lines are       asking: are BMPs are direct effectors of normal programmed cell death? If not, how is       programmed cell death controlled? If so, how do BMPs achieve this endpont? In another study,       we have uncovered an important node of signaling between FGFs and BMP that is essential for       normal development of the limb skeleton. Our previous work, cited above, demonstrates that       specific FGFs, secreted from a distal structure in the limb bud, regulate the normal outgrowth       and patterning of the limb. In current work, we are generating genetic evidence that BMP       signaling to the progenitor population of the skeletal elements regulates this FGF signal by       controlling the expression of an FGF antagonist. This linking of the two signaling pathways is       not only a unique insight into how the limb is patterned but may provide a model for how the       two pathways interact in other developmental contexts or during cancer.","370767",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Skeletal fracture contributes to significant morbidity throughout the human population. Furthermore, in our aging population, the increased incidence of osteoporosis is associated with skeletal injuries, such as hip fractures, resulting in considerable mortality. It is thus important to understand the mechanisms and the molecules involved in fracture repair and the response of the skeleton to mechanical stress. The importance of FGF signaling in skeletal biology is illustrated by the large number of missense mutations in the genes encoding FGF receptors (FGFRs) 1, 2 and 3 that are the etiology of many human craniosynostosis and chondrodysplasia syndromes. Furthermore, loss of function and skeletal-specific conditional loss of function mutations in mouse FGFRs 1,2 and 3 also show specific defects in skeletal development and in the structure and integrity of adult bone. The studies proposed here should provide guidance for the potential manipulation of FGF signaling to treat skeletal injury and disease. In contrast to our increasing understanding of the function of FGFRs in skelatogenesis, there is little information on the FGF ligands that regulate skeletal development, growth, remodeling, vasculogenesis and repair. Adult mice lacking FGF2 (bFGF) have a mild decrease in bone mineral density but no morphological defects in their skeleton. Mice lacking FGF18 die at birth and show moderate skeletal dismorphology. These mice also have a delayed formation of ossification centers, a phenotype not seen in mice lacking FGFRs 1, 2 or 3 in osteoblasts or chondrocytes. Recently, we have identified a skeletal phenotype in mice lacking FGF9. These data suggest that FGF18 (and potentially FGF9) signals to both skeletal cells (chondrocytes and osteoblasts) to regulate early skeletal development and to non-skeletal mesenchymal cells to regulate peri-skeletal vasculogenesis and vascular invasion of the developing growth plate. In this proposal we will: 1) Test the hypothesis that Fgf9, Fgf18 and possibly Fgf2 have redundancy in expression patterns during skeletal development, repair and response to mechanical loading; 2) We will characterize the skeletal phenotypes of mice lacking FGF9, FGF18 and both FGF9 and FGF18 and we will determine whether FGF2 has redundant interactions with FGF9 and FGF18; 3) We will determine the mechanism by which FGF9 and FGF18 regulate vascularization of endochondral bone; 4) We will test the hypothesis that in response to mechanical load, FGF signaling is required for cortical bone formation and associated increased periosteal vascularization.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the major cause of renal failure in childhood. In order to develop more effective preventive and therapeutic interventions, it is important to better understand the molecular pathogenesis of CAKUT. Branching morphogenesis in the developing kidney involves growth and branching of the ureteric bud (UB) and its daughter collecting ducts. Even subtle defects in the efficiency and/or accuracy of this process have profound effects on the ultimate development of the kidney. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is required for the proper development of the renal medulla and papilla, since mutations in the genes encoding components of the RAS in mice cause renal papillary hypoplasia, hydronephrosis, and urinary concentrating defect. In addition, the UB branches and surrounding mesenchymal stroma express angiotensinogen (ACT) and angiotensin (ANG) IIAT1/AT2 receptors. These findings imply that UB-derived epithelia are targets for ANG II actions during metanephric kidney development. In this proposal, we will test the overall hypothesis that ANG II regulates both early and late steps of renal collecting system development. In Aim 1, we will utilize AGT-deficient mice expressing green fluorescent protein in the UB to test the hypothesis that endogenous ANG II is required for UB branching morphogenesis during early metanephric development. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ANG II stimulates papillogenesis during late metanephric development. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that transgenic expression of AT1 receptor in the UB of AT1-deficient mice rescues UB growth and branching. Aim 4 will characterize the cross-talk between the RAS and stromal factors important for UB branching morphogenesis and papillary development. The results of the proposed studies should yield new knowledge on the role of ANG II in UB/papillary growth and development. Such information can be utilized for the design of interventional strategies aimed at the prevention and treatment of CAKUT.

differentiation, and expression of extracellular matrix proteins. TGFps are best known for their tumor
suppressor activity, and while loss of this activity leads to certain hereditary forms of colon and pancreatic
cancer, in most cancers, including those of.the breast, the TGFp signaling pathway remains intact. This
usually has adverse effects since the tumor promoting activities of TGFp, including its ability to stimulate
immune suppression and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transitions, remain intact, yet its growth inhibitory
activity is lost, due to either inactivation of the retinoblastoma gene product (pRB) or expression of growth
stimulatory genes, such as c-myc. The three isoforms of TGFp share 71 - 79 % sequence identity and
signal through a pair of structurally similar single-pass transmembrane receptors known as TRI and TRII.
The isoforms nevertheless fufill distinct roles in vivo as shown by the non-overlapping and lethal phenotypes
of the isoform specific -/- null mice, by differences in response induced by the addition of purified isoforms in
tissue explant assays, and by the opposing roles they play in diseases, such as breast cancer. The origins
of these differences are not understood, although based on previous cell-based crosslinking and structural
studies, it might be due to differences in the manner by which they bind and assemble their receptors into a
signaling complex. The first major objective of this proposal is to define the molecular architecture of the
extracellular component of the TRI:TRII:TGFp signaling complex. This will provide fundamental information
concerning the interdependent nature of TGFp receptor assembly, as well as how assembly differs for the
isoforms whose monomers are fixed relative to one another (TGFps 1 and 2) compared to those whose
monomers are not fixed (TGFpS). The second major component of this project concerns TGFp2, which also
signals by binding and bringing together TRI and TRII, but which binds TRII weakly, and which is dependent
upon a third cell surface TGFp binding protein, known as betaglycan, to induce its cellular responses. The
objective of the proposed studies is to determine the structural basis underlying the mechanism by which the
endoglin-like domain of the TGFp co-receptor betaglycan facilitates binding of TGFp2 to TRII. This will
provide the first example of how one of the co-receptors in the family functions to selectively enhance the
sensitivity of cells to a particular ligand isoform. The information derived from these studies will then be used
to generate mutant TGFps to test whether differences among the isoforms in their manner of receptor
binding indeed underlie their differences in biological activity using two different cell-based systems.","253513",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Elucidating the transcriptional control of osteoblast differentiation is a prerequisite to achieve a better understanding of vertebrate skeletal development in the craniofacial region. Major progress has been made in the last ten years in identifying transcription factors acting as determinant which between mesenchymal cells and osteoblast progenitors in contrast we still have little knowledge how transcription factors control osteoblast terminal differentiation and function. To address this problem we have used a combination of molecular, human and mouse genetic approaches to identify ATF4 as a regulator of osteoblast terminal differentiation and function and the kinase of osteoblast terminal differentiation and function and the kinase RSK2 as a regulator of ATF4 transactivating function. That RSK2 is inactivated in a human skeletal dysplasia termed Coffin Lowry Syndrome that effects primarily the craniofacial region illustrates the biological importance of this regulatory loop. Because ATF4 regulates expression of osteoblast-specific genes and Type I collagen production post-transcriptionally it raises questions about how it executes all its function. Moreover, that RSK2 kinase activity is regulated by extracellular signals suggests that this regulatory loop may explain some of the bone anabolic effect of secreted molecules. Finally, having in hand three osteoblast-specific transcription factors allows us to ask questions about their relationship during development and after birth. To address these questions the specific aims are: To determine to which extent the skeletal phenotype of Atf4-deficient mice is secondary to a decrease in amino acid import. To analyze whether ATF4 is a transcriptional mediator of known extracellular regulators of bone formation. To compare the effect of an osteoblast-specific versus a ubiquitous over-expression of Atf4 in mice. To determine whether Runx2, Osterix and ATF4 interact genetically to affect osteoblast differentiation. To determine whether Atf4 can rescue the osteoblast differentiation defect of Runx2- or of Osterix-deficient mice. To establish in vivo that ATF4 is the physiological target of RSK2 in osteoblasts.

chromatin remodeling factors and mediators of ECM signal transduction pathways (e.g., IGF-1, integrin,
TGF/BMP and c-Src) for expression of Runx2 target genes. Runx2 was discovered as essential for skeletal
formation and regulates genes that control cell growth (p21), recruitment of blood vessels(VEGF),
differentiation of mesenchymal lineage cells and expression of proteins for ECM formation and degradation
(osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, matrix metalloproteinases). Recently, high Runx2 expression has been
reported in metastatic breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and LCC15) that result in destructive osteolytic
lesions in bone. Based on our findings that mutations in Runx2 which block Runx2 targeting functions and
inhibit tumor progression and osteolysis in bone, we postulate that Runx2 controls expression of genes
inducing metastatic properties associated with tumor progression and osteolysis in the bone
micfoenvironment. Our specific aims are directed to understanding the mechanisms by which 1)
endogenous Runx2 functions in metastatic breast cancer cells and 2) the subnuclear targeting deficient
Runx2 mutant protein (STDmRunx2) inhibits expression of Runx2 target genes and blocks tumor growth and
osteolysis in vivo. Using in vitro molecular and in vivo assays of human MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast
cancer cells expressing WT and STDmutant Runx2 proteins, we will address: 1) the Runx2 response to
signaling pathways hyperactive in metastatic cells (with Project 1); 2) the role of Runx2 mediated histone
modifying (HDACs and HATs) and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factors in the control of target genes in
breast cancer cells (with Project 2); 3) the phenotype change induced by WT and STDmRunx2 proteins and
the in vivo fate of the cells lines (with Projects 1,2 and 3); and 4) a potential role of Runx2 in development of
primary mammary tumors (with Project 2).
Lay Summary: Metastatic breast carcinomas most frequently occur in bone. An estimated 70% morbidity of
patients with metastatic breast cancer is associated with the destruction of bone that occurs when the tumor
cells grow in bone. We have discovered that blocking a unique property of a master regulatory protein Runx2
that activates genes highly expressed in metastatic cells, can prevent tumor growth and osteolytic lesions in

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our long term objective is to study how ectodermal organ size is determined. In the last funding period, we studied the regulation of organ size and shape in feather, hair, beak, tooth, etc. We developed the topobiological concept of localized growth zone (LoGZ), suggesting the number, size, position and activity of clustered transient amplifying (TA) cells can determine an organ's size and shape. In this renewal, we ask what unique characteristics in hairs and feathers enable them to increase in size and regenerate continuously throughout adult life. We hypothesize it is made possible by forming a sustaining growth unit, composed of epidermal stem / TA / differentiated cells and a dermal signaling center, topologically arranged in a follicle design that allows the continuous flow of growth and regeneration without structural constraints. Using the feather model, we postulate that FGF / MARK is the major driving force of cell proliferation for size increases throughout bud and follicle stages. Organized growth is essential in organ building and tissue engineering. In the upward feather bud outgrowth, the Notch pathway may specify a growth - maturation gradient to the feather filament growth zone, conferring orientation to the elongating feather buds (Aim 1). In the downward follicle wall invagination, the dermal papilla may work as a signaling center to direct the epithelial tongue extension via FGF 10 (Aim 2). In the growing follicle, FGF activity is modulated by sprouty and antagonized by BMP to generate different structures along the feather axis (Aim 3). Preliminary microarray data are consistent with these candidate pathways. Efforts are made to alter dermal papilla properties so we can convert small feathers into large ones via modulation of the stem cell microenvironment, rather than stem cells themselves (Aim 4). RCAS retroviral vectors, siRNAs, electroporation, protein coated beads, chicken/quail chimeric explant, follicle dermal papilla transplantations, Oil tracing, time lapse movies, microarrays, bioinformatics analyses, etc. are the techniques we will apply to these studies. Using this excellent animal model, we will identify gene pathways critical for follicle morphogenesis and essential topobiological principles for this process. We should learn the developmental origin of appendage stem cells and dermal papilla. The knowledge acquired can be directed to make short hairs grow longer, and to engineer ectodermal stem cells into follicles with sustaining growth ability.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major goal of this proposal is to understand molecular events preventing primary vitreous hyperplasia and guiding the regression of the hyaloid vascular system (HVS) during eye development. I will specifically investigate the roles of Arf, an important mammalian tumor suppressor gene, and Platelet-derived growth factor receptor 2 (Pdgfr2), which contributes to a variety of developmental, physiological, and pathological processes. To assure normal development, mammalian cells have mechanisms to check cell proliferation stimuli and preserve cell cycle arrest. When gone awry, excess mitogenic signals lead to developmental defects and a wide variety of pathological processes. The Arf gene product, p19Arf, was initially discovered to play a key role as a ""fuse"" to control excess mitogens and prevent tumor formation. Work supported by the first cycle of this R01 has challenged this simple paradigm as I have shown p19Arf plays an essential function during mouse eye development. Without it, excess numbers of perivascular cells envelop the hyaloid vasculature in the vitreous, preventing their normal involution during the later stages of eye development. Mice lacking Arf are blind due to a pathological process strikingly similar to severe persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV). We have identified a new biochemical and genetic pathway in which the Arf gene product blocks signals stemming from Pdgfr2 to prevent primary vitreous hyperplasia, likely by repressing the expression of the receptor. In the current proposal, I will tackle the critical questions that still cloud our understanding of the functional relationship between the two gene products. I will take advantage of existing cell culture system and mouse models one of which will be developed in this proposal to (1) identify how p19Arf- dependent control of Pdgfr2 influences eye development; (2) uncover mechanisms by with Pdgfr2 fosters vitreous hyperplasia without Arf; and (3) elucidate mechanisms by which Arf represses Pdgfr2 expression. Insight into how Pdgfr2 contributes to the eye pathology in the absence of Arf and how p19Arf controls Pdgfr2-dependent signals will address fundamental aspects of eye development; leave me ideally positioned to address whether genetic abnormalities in this new ""pathway"" contribute to the pathogenesis of PHPV or other vitreoretinopathies; and begin to investigate whether pharmacological disruption of Pdgfr2 signaling can ameliorate the disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major goal of this proposal is to understand molecular events preventing primary vitreous hyperplasia and guiding the regression of the hyaloid vascular system (HVS) during eye development. I have identified a new biochemical and genetic pathway in which the Arf gene product, p19Arf, blocks signals stemming from Platelet-derived growth factor receptor 2 (Pdgfr2) to prevent primary vitreous hyperplasia, likely by repressing the expression of the receptor. I will use cell culture-based and mouse models to uncover how Pdgfr2 contributes to the eye pathology in the absence of Arf and how p19Arf controls Pdgfr2-dependent signals.

In mice, the odontogenic potential, defined as the capability of an odontogenic tissue to elicit tooth developmental program in non-dental tissues, resides initially in dental epithelium, and then shifts to dental mesenchyme. Our long-term goal is to delineate the molecular basis of the odontogenic potential. Based on our previous studies, we hypothesize that during tooth initiation, BMP4 functions as an essential component of the odontogenic potential in the early dental epithelium, to induce the formation of the basal layer epithelium as well as to stimulate local cell proliferation to form a tooth bud. We further hypothesize that Wnt signaling pathway constitutes a component of the odontogenic potential in dental mesenchyme. Two specific aims are proposed to test these hypotheses. In Aim 1, the role of BMP4 in the early dental epithelium in tooth initiation will be defined by conditional knockout studies via the Cre/LoxP approach to achieve tissue-specific mutation of Bmp4 in the dental epithelium. This approach will also be used to delete the Bmpr-lA and Bmpr-IB genes in the dental epithelium to study if BMP4 acts intra-epithelially. Whether signaling of BMP4 to dental mesenchyme is essential for the acquisition of odontogenic potential in the mesenchyme will be tested by tissue recombination studies. Furthermore, whether Shh mediates Bmp4 activity in dental epithelium will be examined by conditional knockout and transgenic rescue experiments. In Aim 2, if Wnt signaling acts as a critical component of the odontogenic potential in dental mesenchyme will be studied by disrupting Writ signaling pathway in tissues used for tissue recombination. This will be achieved by overexpressing Wnt antagonist sFrp3 in dental mesenchyme, and Dkk1 and a dominant negative form of Tcf in responding non-dental epithelia via microelectroporation and virus-mediated gene delivery. The potential role of Wnt5a in the induction of tooth formation by dental mesenchyme will also be tested. Lastly, whether different sFrps confer the different inductive properties to incisor and molar mesenchyme will be determined by virus-mediated gene overexpression and RNAi-mediated gene knock-down studies, together with tissue recombination and organ culture studies.","351657",

malformations such as neural tube defects and cortical malformations. Yet, cerebellar malformations are
common, affecting approximately 1/5000 births. Dandy-Walker Malformation (DWM) and cerebellar vermis
hypoplasia (CVH- also known as Dandy-Walker Variant) are the most frequent cerebellar malformations, and
affected individuals often have motor deficits, mental retardation, and some have hydrocephalus. Although
the specific causes of these clinically important birth defects remain largely undefined, there is evidence for
considerable genetic heterogeneity and complex inheritance. Based on physical mapping of chromosomal
abnormalities in patients, we have identified 3 loci harboring human cerebellar malformation genes: on
chromosomes 3q24, 6p25 and 7q36. This proposal describes a series of experiments aimed at
understanding the developmental mechanisms leading to the structural cerebellar and posterior fossa
abnormities associated with these loci through the study of several mouse models.
We have previously demonstrated that heterozygous co-deletion of the closely linked ZIC1/4 genes on
chromosome 3q24 causes DWM. Aim 1 of this proposal describes a series of genetic experiments in mice to
assess the developmental pathways regulated by these Zic genes and a set of in vitro analyses to determine
the physical nature of Zic1and Zic4 protein interactions underlying the observed genetic interaction. The
experiments in Aim 2 are designed to define the basis of 6p25 DWM, through phenotypic characterization of
both null and conditional mouse mutants of a candidate gene influencing both posterior fossa mesenchymal
and cerebellar development. Further, genetic interactions between the 3q24 and 6p25 loci will be assessed.
Finally, Aim 3 describes a series of transgenic experiments to determine the gene(s) and underlying
developmental disruption causing severe CVH in a patient with a small genomic duplication of 7q36. Since
similar mechanisms underlie both mouse and human CNS development, analysis of these mice will to
determine the underlying molecular and developmental causes of human cerebellar malformations. This
information is critical to the identification of additional malformation loci.","324496",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Goals of this proposal are to extend fundamental principles in lung stem cell biology for the development of effective strategies to amplify and purify lung stem cells, deliver them to repair deficient airways, and enhance epithelial reparative capacity. The underlying premise upon which this proposal is based is that defects in the reparative capacity of epithelial cells represent a common factor contributing to the progression of chronic lung disease, and that strategies aimed at enhancing epithelial reparative capacity will be essential components of treatments to effect lung regeneration. To achieve the goals of this proposal we have organized a research team drawing from basic and clinical scientists with expertise in stem cell biology, cell-based therapy, lung injury and repair, and the clinical management of chronic lung disease in humans. The scientific foundation for studies proposed in this application is based upon our previous demonstration that endogenous tissue stem cells are required for maintenance of epithelial reparative capacity, and that potentiation of b-catenin signaling in airways of mice leads to expansion of endogenous stem cells that harbor intrinsic reparative capacity. Accordingly, we hypothesize that pharmacologic interventions capable of transiently activating b-catenin signaling will lead to expansion of endogenous stem cells and enhanced epithelial reparative capacity, and that enriched populations of reparative cells obtained through potentiation of b-catenin signaling can be used for restoration of epithelial reparative capacity in repair-deficient recipient airways. Three aims are proposed that will build a platform upon which cell-based therapies can be further developed. Aim 1 will use transient activation of b-catenin signaling for the amplification of mouse and human airway stem cells. In Aim 2, we will define the cell surface phenotype of bronchiolar stem cells for the prospective purification and enrichment of airway stem cells. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the feasibility of using amplified bronchiolar stem cells for the restoration of reparative capacity in repair-deficient airways. Accomplishing these aims will provide a rational foundation upon which to further develop strategies for the delivery of reparative cells to lung tissue for correction of epithelial repair defects.","18720",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer has a prevalence of 33% and is the third highest cause of cancer-related death in American males (25). In cancer biology, the primary tumor is usually not the main cause of patient death, but rather metastasis of the tumor cells. During the transition from localized to metastatic cancer, cells undergo changes in adhesion and morphology in a process referred to as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (8). This process results in breakdown of intercellular junctions which results to increased cell migratory potential. Several signaling pathways regulate the cell adhesion molecules that maintain an epithelial architecture. Rap1 is one of the signaling cascades that has been shown to regulate most integrins receptors as well as E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesions (20, 21). Our goal is to elucidate the role of Rap1 in cell migration, invasion and survival and to determine how alteration of its signals might play a role in increased tumor aggressiveness. Studies done by our lab and that of our collaborators have shown that downregulation of the Rap1 signaling pathway may be critical for hypoxia-induced cellular migration. It has long been hypothesized that hypoxia can initiate metastatic processes, but the mechanisms underlying this process are not well defined. HIF-1 alpha is a heterodimeric transcription factor that regulates genes essential for survival in hypoxic environments. We hypothesize that HIF-1 alpha regulates RaplA and that decreased Rap1 signaling is important for prostate cancer metastasis. The goals of this project are to elucidate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of RAP1 genes and the role of Rap1 signals in tumor metastasis. Furthermore, the proposed research will increase our understanding of fundamental cellular processes relevant to tumor cell adhesion, migration, invasion, and survival. This research will help validate the Rap1 pathway as a possible new target for therapies to treat prostate cancer metastasis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator):   
  
Although the gestation period in mammals can last more than a year, it is rarely appreciated that the basic body plan of the embryo is established shortly after fertilization. In humans, the embryo establishes the three main body axes, the head to tail, dorsoventral and left/right axes, within the first two weeks of development. The importance of the early stages of embryogenesis for proper embryo development is underscored by the fact that thirty percent of human pregnancies are lost at early post-implantation stages. In previous studies, we have shown that the mouse conceptus is a dynamic and molecularly patterned structure. One major discovery is that the visceral endoderm, an extra-embryonic component, undergoes major rearrangements and is composed of several molecularly and morphologically distinct cell populations. These studies have pushed back the proven boundary of axial patterning in mice to 5.5 days post fertilization and more importantly, suggest that the visceral endoderm provides the blueprint for the establishment of the axes of the embryo. Using the mouse as a model system, we combine embryological, genetic and molecular approaches to investigate: (i) The relationship between the axes of pre- and post- implantation embryos; (ii) The role of the posterior visceral endoderm in the specification of the primitive streak, a structure that serves as a conduit for the generation of mesoderm and endoderm; (iii) The role of the visceral endoderm in the establishment of the primary heart field. Our central hypothesis is that the visceral endoderm has a major role in patterning the mouse embryo during early post-implantation stages and that these interactions are paramount for the initial stages of organogenesis. Our research will provide an understanding of the basic biology of the early mammalian embryo that serves as the foundation for the study of normal and abnormal human development. Project Narrative: The proposed studies are aimed at understanding the biology of mouse development during the initial stages of embryogenesis. We concentrate our studies in the role of the visceral endoderm, an extra- embryonic tissue, in the establishment of the three major axes of the embryo: the head to tail, dorsoventral and left-right axes. We also address the role of the visceral endoderm in the initial stages of heart development. Because development of the mammalian embryo is a hierarchical process, the events of early embryogenesis have profound consequences for the subsequent development of the organism. One of the main goals of our research is to determine if the basic body plan of the mammalian embryo is established at pre-implantation or post-implantation stages. Understanding this process is of major relevance in human procedures aimed at improving conception, such as intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). These procedures require extensive manipulation of gametes and culture of pre-implantation conceptuses that could cause birth defects. The study of axial development requires the understanding of the molecular bases of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. This process is pivotal for the metastasis of carcinomas. Hence, our studies are relevant for cancer research. Finally, by understanding the initial stages of heart development, we provide the foundations for the development of approaches to generate myocardial cells.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of my project is to understand how chondrocytes, which make cartilage, and osteoblasts, which make bone, generate the specific elements of the zebrafish facial skeleton. During endochondral and dermal bone development, cells differentiate, organize into condensations, then proliferate and rearrange to generate the distinct shapes of skeletal elements. My aim is to understand how skeletogenic cells generate pattern by tracking cells from initial condensations at 50 hours post fertilization, to 4 days post fertilization when skeletal elements are easily identifiable. I will examine this process using 4D confocal in vivo imaging of wild-type and myocyte enhancing factor-2c (mef2ca) mutant (hoover) embryos, which have patterning defects in endochondral and dermal bones. Mef2c is a transcription factor in the endothelinl (ednl) pathway, disruption of which is associated with cleft palate defects in humans. With total loss of mef2c function in zebrafish (mef2cb morpholino-injected mef2ca mutants), ossification of bones does not occur. To track chondrocytes in endochondral bone formation (Aim 1), I will study embryos on the mCherry;fli1:EGFP reporter line which marks neural crest cells. Chondrocytes will be distinguished on the basis of morphology. The mCherry;fli1:EGFP line does not allow distinction of osteoblasts specifically, so to track osteoblasts in dermal bone formation (Aim 2), I will generate a fluorescent transgenic reporter line for osterix (osx), a transcription factor required for osteoblast differentiation. I hypothesize that correct morphology depends early cell position and subsequent stereotyped cell movements. I predict that in mef2ca mutants, either the initial organization of chondrocytes and osteoblasts in condensations or the subsequent rearrangement of cells during bone growth is abnormal, generating patterning defects. Recent analyses suggest that class II histone deacetylase-4 (Hdac4) represses Mef2c. Therefore, another aim of my project is to investigate the effects of Hdac4 in regulating bone shape by knocking down hdac4 using splice-blocking morpholinos in wild-type embryos, in mef2ca mutants, and in mef2cb morpholino-injected mef2ca mutants (Aim 3). I predict that loss of Hdac4 in zebrafish lacking mef2c orthologues will either have no effect on patterning or ossification defects, or will rescue defects by restoring normal cell behavior. More than half of all birth defects are associated with some sort of craniofacial malformation. Understanding how normal skeletal cell activity translates into shape is informative towards understanding how abnormal cell behavior can give rise to defects. By investigating the role of genes involved in palate formation, we can begin to test the function of specific genetic pathways in the generation of cleft palate deformities.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Normal as well as neoplastic cells invade surrounding tissues by mobilizing proteolytic enzymes that allow them to degrade the structural barriers established by the extracellular matrix. One group of proteinases, known as the matrix-degrading metalloproteinases or MMPs, is currently believed to play a prominent role in matrix remodeling events since these enzymes can, in concert, degrade all of the major proteinaceous components of the extracellular matrix including collagens, elastin and proteoglycans. Recently, the first membrane-anchored member of the MMP family, termed the membrane type-1 MMP (MT1-MMP), was identified and shown to be expressed not only in normal mesenchymal/epithelial cell types, but also at heightened levels in a variety of human carcinomas. Based on the ability of MT1-MMP to activate progelatinase A and/or collagenase-3, it has been postulated that this metalloproteinase axis may act as the ""master switch"" that regulates the expression of the tissue-invasive phenotype. However, increasing evidence suggests that MT1-MMP plays a direct and critical - role in regulating cell-matrix interactions. More recent data now indicate that MT1-MMP activity may be complemented by a second, membrane-anchored MMP, termed MT2-MMP. While little is known with regard to MT2-MMP structure or function, the protease is postulated to play a dominant, and heretofore, unsuspected role in regulating normal and neoplastic epithelial cell function. To this end, we seek to use a series of molecular, genetic and cellular approaches to i) characterize MT2-MMP structure and function relationships in extracellular matrix degradation and invasion, ii) define the relative roles of MT2-MMP and MT1-MMP in normal tissue development and iii) characterize the functional impact of MT2-MMP and/or MT1-MMP on cancer growth, invasion and metastasis in vivo. These studies should provide new insights into the role of the MT-MMPs in normal as well as neoplastic cell populations and define their potential importance as targets for novel therapeutic interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies should provide new insights into the role of the MT-MMPs in normal and neoplastic cell populations and define their potential importance as targets for novel therapeutic interventions.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integrin-mediated cell adhesion to extracellular matrices regulates the organization, maintenance and repair of numerous tissues, and abnormalities in adhesive interactions are often associated with pathological states. The adhesive process comprises integrin receptor binding to their extracellular ligand, integrin clustering, and assembly of discrete supramolecular structures containing cytoskeletal and signaling molecules. These focal adhesion complexes function as structural links and signal transduction elements between the cell and its extracellular environment. While significant progress has been attained in deciphering biochemical pathways regulating adhesion, the mechanical interactions between a cell and its environment remain poorly understood. The objective of this renewal application is to analyze the role of nanoscale organization and structure of focal adhesions in the generation of cell-extracellular matrix forces. Our central hypothesis is that the precise nanoscale organization of integrins and their interaction with specific cytoskeletal elements regulate adhesive interactions by controlling the distribution of mechanical forces within the adhesive interface. The rationale for this project is that it will provide new insights into how the structure of focal adhesion complexes regulates adhesive processes, such as adhesion strength and migration. Aim 1: Analyze the effects of nanoscale focal adhesion structure (cluster size, spacing) on cell adhesive force and migration. Aim 2: Elucidate the contributions of integrin-cytoskeleton interactions at the adhesion complex to adhesion strength and migration. The proposed research is innovative because it integrates robust quantitative assays, nanopatterning approaches, and unique cell biology reagents to precisely manipulate focal complex architecture and biomolecular interactions in order to analyze how these adhesive complexes generate adhesive forces. We will elucidate the contributions of nanoscale clustering to adhesive force generation. These rigorous analyses will yield new, sensitive measurements of the contributions of biomolecular interactions between focal complex components to adhesive force. Collectively, this research will generate a new understanding of the regulation of mechanical interactions between a cell and its extracellular matrix. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The generation of adhesive forces is essential to cellular functions in physiological processes and pathological conditions. The objective of this research is to derive a fundamental understanding of the molecular events at the adhesive interface that regulate cell adhesive forces. This work will provide new insights in the molecular mechanisms controlling adhesive processes.

of this renewal application will be on mechanisms of environmentally induced asthma in young children, using
the model of environmental allergic asthma in infant rhesus monkeys that we have developed through support
of this program. Using this model over the previous five years of funding, we have made a number of startling
discoveries regarding the effect of chronic ozone exposure on lung development and growth during infancy,
including: stunting of airway growth, postnatal loss of airway generations, impaired establishment of the FGF-2
ternary signaling complex by basal cells, the failure of epithelial surfaces to innervate, impaired central nervous
control, enhancement of the allergic response, airway hyperreactivity, disrupted alveolarization, and airway
remodeling. The analytical framework in which all of the studies proposed for this renewal will be conducted is
the epithelial/mesenchymal trophic unit, whose cellular components establish trophic interactions via an
extracellular signaling complex modulated by the basement membrane zone.
The overall hypothesis for this program is that environmental exposure to oxidant air pollutants promotes the
development of allergic asthma in the developing lungs of young children and exacerbates its severity by: (1)
disrupting the homeostasis within the epithelial/mesenchymal trophic unit and (2) fundamentally compromising
the establishment and differentiation of the trophic interactions that promote normal airway growth and
development. These changes result from the superimposition of continual cycles of acute injury, inflammation,
and repair on the immune response to allergen exposure.
This Project will focus on the epithelial and mesenchymal cells (fibroblasts, smooth muscle) and the basement
membrane zone within the epithelial/mesenchymal trophic unit, with the following specific aims:
1) Define the impact ozone and allergen exposure during postnatal development on the function of airway
epithelium as the principle reactive interface between the environment and the rest of the
epithelial/mesenchymal trophic unit.
2) Define the impact of ozone and allergen exposure during postnatal development on the function of the
basal cell-basement membrane zone-fibroblast complex as both a mediator and a source of extracellular
signaling between luminal epithelium and the matrix within the epithelial/mesenchymal trophic unit.
3) Define the impact of oxidant and allergen exposure during postnatal development on the airway smooth
muscle as a responder to signaling from the basal cell-basement membrane zone-fibroblast complex and
as a player in generating and maintaining the extracellular signaling milieu."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
 The potential importance of lymphoproliferative angiogenesis arises from two critical observations: 1) the association of disease progression with increased angiogenic activity; and 2) the assocation of clinical efficacy in pilot studies with anti-angiogenic therapy. We have shown that the vascular composition of human lymphoproliferative subtypes reflects differential recruitment and assembly of either hemangiogenic (CD68+VEGFR-1+) cells or mesenchymal smooth muscle cells.- The mechanisms leading to the recruitment and assembly of these cells are largely unknown. Annexin 2 (A2) is a fibrinolytic protease receptor that binds plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) at the surface of endothelial cells and monocyte/macrophages. Deficiency in A2 impairs effective neo-angiogenesis, and results in failure of lymphoproliferative progression in A2-null mice. Ongoing preliminary studies in primary human lymphoproliferative specimens indicate that A2 is predominantly expressed by neovascular endothelial cells, perivascular CD68+ hematopoietic cells, and smooth muscle pericytes. The objective of this project is to define the function of A2 in directing lymphoproliferative neovascular formation, with the hope to gain insights into the biology, pathogenesis and therapeutics of the disease. We hypothesize that A2 critically supports lymphoproliferative neo-angiogenesis by mediating vascular and stromal cell recruitment, migration, and assembly via cell surface plasmin generation and matrix metalloproteinases activation. We propose to: 1) establish whether lymphoproliferative angiogenesis is dependent on A2-mediated vascular and perivascular cell recruitment and assembly in a mouse model, 2) define the molecular and biochemical mechanisms by which A2 supports lymphoproliferative angiogenesis, 3) determine whether delineation of subpopulations of A2+ vascular and perivascular cells has prognostic significance in human patients. This proposal describes a 5 year career development program in academic translational medicine. The principal investigator has completed structured residency and fellowship training in Hematology-Oncology, and now will expand her scientific skills through a unique intergration of interdepartmental resources at Weill Cornell Medical Center under the mentorship of Dr. Katherine A. Hajjar, a recognized leader in the field of vascular biology, who is fully committed to the independence of the applicant.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cryptorchidism is by far the most common defect of sexual differentiation in humans. Testicular descent can be anatomically divided into two stages, i.e., transabdominal and inguinoscrotal phases. It is known that both insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) and androgen signaling pathways play critical roles in the control of the transabdominal phase of testis descent. However, the mechanism that regulates the inguinoscrotal phase is not completely understood, even though the incidence of this defect is much more common clinically. Targeted disruption of luteinizing hormone receptor (LHRKO) in mouse impaired development of adult-type Leydig cells which resulted in a dramatic reduction of INSL3 and testosterone levels. Surprisingly, serum estradiol levels were significantly increased. LHRKO males exhibited a bilateral cryptorchid phenotype resulting from a defect in inguinoscrotal testis descent. Histology, morphometry, cell proliferation and differentiation analyses demonstrated the defect was due to a reduction in mesenchymal cell division and differentiation into cremaster muscle cells during the second stage of testis descent. The expression of several genes in the gubernaculum that are known to be involved in gubernacular development, such as Hoxa10, Hoxa11, Wt1, Dll1 and Desrt, were not altered in mutant mice, while Lgr8, Notch1 and Numb mRNA levels were drastically deceased as compared with age-matched wild type siblings. In contrast, the expressions of Esr1 (ER1) and Esr2 (ER2) were significantly elevated. Postnatal testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) completed testicular descent into the scrotum and concomitantly normalized estradiol concentrations in the circulation and Esr1, Esr2, Lgr8, Notch1 and Numb mRNA levels in the gubernaculum. Remedy of the defect by TRT was neither dependent on recovery of adult-type Leydig cells nor the genitofemoral nerve but required androgen receptor activity in the gubernaculum. Using organ culture of the gubernaculum in vitro, androgen alone did not significantly stimulate proliferation of gubernacular mesenchymal cells without activation of the leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 8 (LGR8) signaling pathway by addition of INSL3 or relaxin. Co-treatment of estrogen with androgen prevented androgen-induced Lgr8 expression. Cotreatment of INSL3 and androgen increased Notch1 but not Numb mRNA levels. Taking these results together, we hypothesize that induction of the Lgr8 gene expression by androgen and activation of LGR8 signal impinging on the Notch system to stimulate gubernacular cell proliferation, differentiation and myogenesis are the essential molecular pathways in the control of gubernacular development to facilitate inguinoscrotal testis descent. In addition to androgen deficiency, unbalanced androgen/estrogen signals also play a role in contributing to the cryptorchid phenotype in LHR null animals. In this grant application, we propose four specific aims to verify our hypotheses: (1) to define the underlying mechanism by which androgen modulates the Lgr8 gene expression in the gubernaculum; (2) to assess the role of the LGR8 signaling pathway in androgen-induced inguinoscrotal testis descent in LHR null males; (3) to determine the importance of the Notch signaling pathway in mediating androgen and LGR8 signals to regulate gubernaculum development during inguinoscrotal testis descent and (4) to investigate the effect of estrogen on androgen-induced inguinoscrotal testis descent in LHR null males. Cryptorchidism is by far the most common birth defect in males. Although inguinoscrotal testis descent is known to be androgen dependent, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The current proposal is focusing on determining androgen downstream target genes and subsequent signaling network during the process of inguinoscrotal testis descent, which may provide new insight into the causes of testis maldescent.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Secreted Hedgehog (Hh) ligands play important roles in growth and patterning of various tissues during development, and recent studies have uncovered transient reactivation of Hh signaling during injury and repair of several adult tissues. There is compelling evidence that sustained Hh signaling, which may be initiated during an aberrant response to injury, is associated with a wide variety of human malignancies. Moreover, uncontrolled Hh pathway activity may be required for tumor maintenance, since blockade of Hh signaling inhibits the growth of several types of 'Hh-activated' tumor cells. It has been proposed that only those cell types which utilize the Hh pathway during embryogenesis or repair are prone to Hh pathway-associated tumorigenesis, but this concept has not been rigorously tested. Gastric cancer is the 2nd most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide, and the great majority of gastric tumors are associated with elevated Hh signaling activity, attributed to abnormally high expression of the Hh ligands Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and/or Indian hedgehog (Ihh). We have generated a robust model of gastric adenocarcinoma by constitutively activating Hh signaling in mouse stomach, pointing to a causal role for deregulated Hh signaling in the pathogenesis of these aggressive tumors in humans. However, there is presently little insight into how aberrations in Hh signaling contribute to gastric tumorigenesis, which progenitor cells give rise to 'Hh-activated' gastric cancers, and whether Hh signaling is required for maintenance of established tumors. Moreover, the precise functions of Hh signaling in normal stomach have not yet been established, and there is a little information regarding changes in Hh signaling activity during gastric injury and repair, which can predispose to cancer development. In Aim 1, we propose to identify the cell types expressing Hh pathway components, and determine the function of Hh signaling, in normal and pathologically altered stomach. In Aim 2, we will explore the function of Hh signaling in gastric tumor biology and maintenance. The proposed studies will provide new insights into the functions of Hh signaling in normal and injured stomach, and the role of deregulated Hh signaling in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:
 Obesity is characterized by an increase in adipose tissue mass due to hypertrophy of existing fat cells
and through the generation of new adipocytes (hyperplasia). New adipocytes arise from resident
preadipocytes and interstitial mesenchymal stem cells. Conversion of these precursor cells to mature
adipocytes requires the temporally orchestrated expression of transcription factors including C/EBPs � and �,
and PPAR�, which leads to the expression of factors associated with the mature adipocyte phenotype. Our
studies have shown that activation of the transcription factor CREB is also required to induce adipogenic
conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. CREB activation also protects mature adipocytes from apoptosis in vitro.
While much has been learned from these in vitro studies, the role of CREB in adipose biology has not been
explored in animal models.
 Recent preliminary studies show that CREB levels are diminished in adipose tissue from obese mice
and rats. This may account, in part, for the increased adipocyte apoptosis and suppression of adipogenesis
observed in obese individuals. It may also account for the infiltration of fat tissue from obese subjects with
macrophages, since inhibition of CREB activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes not only induces their apoptosis, but also
increases expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), macrophage migration inhibitory factor-1
(MIF-1), macrophage colony stimulating factor-1 (MCSF-1), CXC ligand 13, stromal cell-derived factors -1
(SDF-1) and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3). Our preliminary studies have led us to propose two
hypotheses related to CREB function in adipose biology. First, we hypothesize that CREB is required for
adipogenesis, adipose tissue development, and adipocyte survival (Fig.1). Second, we hypothesize that loss
of CREB in apoptotic adipocytes promotes the recruitment or retention of macrophages in adipose tissue via
the upregulation of ICAM-1, MCSF-1, MIF-1, CXCL13, SDF-1 and/or MCP-3.
 Four Specific Aims will test these hypotheses using in vivo and in vitro models. Aim 1 will test
whether forced depletion of CREB in preadipocytes inhibits adipogenesis in vivo, and whether forced loss of
CREB in adipocytes induces their apoptotic death in vivo. Aim 2 will investigate the impact of adipocyte-
specific CREB depletion on adiposity and whole animal physiology. Aim 3 will determine whether forced loss
of CREB in adipocytes alone or both adipocytes and macrophages promotes macrophage recruitment to
adipose tissue. The fourth Aim will explore the ability of forced CREB depletion in adipocytes to promote
macrophage recruitment and/or adhesion to adipocytes in vitro. We anticipate that these studies will define the
impact of CREB on adipose tissue formation and function in animal models, and highlight CREB and
associated factors and processes as potential targets for therapies designed to treat or prevent obesity and
other adipose disorders.","NIDDK","7580590","9/29/2008 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01DK053969-10A2","2","R01","DK","053969","10","A","HAFT, CAROL R","8/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","Integrative Physiology of Obesity and Diabetes Study Section[IPOD]"," ","1866151","KLEMM, DWIGHT J","Not Applicable","06","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","US","39.708143","-104.724958","1199905","UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER","Aurora","CO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","800452570","UNITED STATES","N","9/29/2008 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2008"," "," ","NIDDK"," "," "," ","  
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Obesity and weight gain are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and affect a sizable and rapidly increasing population in the U.S. and other developed countries. Considerable effort has gone into understanding the changes in adipose tissue that accompany obesity in order to identify therapeutic targets to prevent of treat obesity and related conditions. In spite of progress in this area, few effective strategies have been developed. A central goal of our research, therefore, is to identify new factors and processes that may serve as targets for novel interventional strategies. The research proposed in this application is designed to assess the impact of CREB on the development of fat tissue, its role in mature adipocyte survival, and adipose tissue inflammation. We anticipate that these studies will define the impact of CREB on adipose tissue formation and function in animal models, and highlight CREB and associated factors and processes as potential targets for therapies designed to treat or prevent obesity and other adipose disorders.

The proteins bind to cell surface receptors and transmit signals by several pathways, including the beta-catenin pathway. Upon receptor activation, cytoplasmic beta-catenin transits to the nucleus and forms complexes with resident transcription factors (LEF or TCFs) that bind response sequences and modulate target gene expression. In recent studies, we have shown that the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway operates in growth plate chondrocytes during skeletal formation. We found that beta-catenin is cytoplasmic in proliferating and prehypertrophic cells, but undergoes a dramatic nuclear re-localization in hypertrophic chondrocytes. In good agreement, promoter-driven expression of constitutive-active LEF/TCF proteins boosted chondrocyte maturation, expression of genes such as MMP-13, and matrix mineralization. Dominant-negative constructs blocked these events. These and other findings lead us to our central hypothesis: activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is required for chondrocyte hypertrophy and function and for progression and completion of endochondral ossification. To test this hypothesis, we will identify Wnt and LEF/TCF molecules expressed by growth plate chondrocytes and determine their activity and function during chondrocyte maturation and endochondral ossification. We will also characterize mechanisms by which beta-catenin-LEF/TCF complexes regulates gene expression in hypertrophic cells. Approaches to be used will include: cell cultures; in vivo analyses of avian and mammalian embryos; RNA interference; creation and analysis of transgenic mice; promoter reporter tests. The results will shed important light into a previously unsuspected pathway that operates in hypertrophic chondrocytes and controls their function and roles in endochondral ossification. The data will also suggest future targets of investigation to determine the possible involvement of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in pathologies of cartilage and bone, a presumption based on well-established roles of Writ signaling in the pathology of other tissues and organs.","249676",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The thymus provides a unique microenvironment for the generation of self-tolerant, self-restricted T cells that are indispensable for the adaptive immune response. Given that thymus involution and reduced T cell output are consequences of advancing age or disease, there is considerable interest in therapeutic strategies aimed at thymus restoration. However, it is essential to understand the cellular interactions and molecular pathways that are required to generate the thymus de novo during ontogeny in order to devise rational approaches for its regeneration. This application focuses on the mechanisms by which neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells regulate development of the epithelial and hematopoietic compartments during thymus organogenesis. Our preliminary data reveal that neural crest cells (NCCs) play a previously unrecognized role in patterning 3rd PP endoderm and suggest that NCCs play distinct roles during early and late stages of thymus organogenesis. The NCC defect in Pax3Sp/Sp embryos results in a boundary shift between thymus and parathryoid specific domains of the common third pouch primordia. In comparison to wild-type littermates, the shared primordia of Pax3Sp/Sp mutants have a relatively smaller Gcm2 expressing domain and a correspondingly larger Foxnl expressing domain. Importantly, overall cellularity is comparable in the shared primordia of mutant and wild-type littermates. There is neither an increase in the frequency of proliferating cells, nor a decrease in the frequency of apoptotic cells in the shared primordia of Pax3Sp/Sp compared to Pax3+/+ littermates. Therefore, the increased number of third pouch endodermal progenitors that are committed to a thymus fate accounts for the unexpectedly large, albeit ectopic, thymic lobes in E12.5 Pax3Sp/Sp embryos. Although the findings appear to be at odds with the general consensus that NCC deficiencies result in thymus hypoplasia, the likely explanation for this paradox is that NCCs perform distinct functions at different developmental stages. Initially, NCC-derived signals are required for correct patterning of the third pouch endoderm. Specific Aims 1 and 2 focus on the molecular mechanisms by which NCCs control thymus versus parathyroid fate decisions in endodermal progenitors. At a slightly later stage of thymus organogenesis, the condensing NC-derived mesenchymal capsule produces Fgf7 and FgflO that promote-outgrowth of the thymus rudiment. It remains to be determined whether NCCs play additional roles in the late fetal and postnatal thymus. This issue is the central focus of Specific Aim 3.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objectives of this proposal are to understand the genetic control of a specific subpopulation of endocardium, the pro-valve endocardial cells (PVECs), and determine their role in valve formation. During embryogenesis, NFATd expression is restricted to the endocardium and its expression is accentuated in the PVECs (endocardial cells that do NOT undergo mesenchymal transformation during the formation of cardiac valves). These observations suggest that a focus on NFATd regulation may provide unique insights into the transcriptional program orchestrating pro-valve endocardial development and valve formation. Having recently identified a 243 bp sequence within the first intron of NFATd that serves as a PVEC specific transcriptional enhancer required for accentuation of NFATd gene expression and having determined that a conserved 58 bp sequence within this enhancer region functions as a critical cis-regulatory element, controlling both the intensity and specificity of NFATd expression in the PVEC population, we hypothesized that this NFATd enhancer region defines an enhanceosome that plays a critical role in the regulation of NFATd expression essential for normal PVEC development and valve formation. Therefore, we propose to 1) Determine the molecular components and interactions required for activation of the PVEC-specific NFATd transcriptional enhancing complex using a novel enodardial cell line for gel shift, DNA affinity purification and mass psectrometry, 2) Define the in vivo role of the PVEC enhanceosome in PVEC development and valve formation utilizing a cre-loxp based dual-genetic mouse model for sequential analysis of enhanceosome suppression and activation of NFATd expression, and 3) Delineate the in vivo role of the PVEC endocardial subpopulation by spatiotemporal ablation of these cells using bigenic cre-/loxp, puAtk conditional genetic ablator mouse line. This work will define critical regulatory mechanisms required for heart valve development and will inform novel tissue-regeneration remedies for valve degeneration.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development of the middle and upper face rely on signaling interactions among the forebrain, the neural crest mesenchyme, and the surface ectoderm. We have determined that signals derived from the forebrain control the formation of a signaling center (Frontonasal ectodermal zone; FEZ) in the surface ectoderm that regulates growth and patterning of the middle and upper face. Further, we demonstrated that disruptions to FEZ formation produced embryos that exhibited formes frustes of Holoprosencephaly (HPE). Our long term goal is to determine the underlying molecular mechanism(s) that regulate the establishment of the FEZ and to determine how signals derived from this signaling center regulate patterned growth of the middle and upper face. Cells within the FEZ express morphogens like Shh, Fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8), and Bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). These molecules are ideal candidates for mediating function of the FEZ and are likely targets for teratogenic insults that produce malformations within this region of the head. We hypothesize that signaling by BMPs and SHH regulate induction of Shh expression in the ectoderm, and that together, Bmps, Shh, and Fgf8 regulate function of the FEZ. In our first Specific Aim we will assess whether BMP and/or SHH signaling are directly required within the ectodermal cells for induction of Shh expression in the FEZ, and we will assess the functional consequence of FEZ formation in the absence of BMP signaling. The objective of the second Specific Aim is to examine the role of the Bmps that are expressed within the FEZ using a tissue-specific, loss-of-function approach in avian embryos. Specifically, we will assess the morphological and molecular consequence of knocking-down Bmp expression. In our third Specific Aim we will assess the role of Fgf8 in establishing the FEZ, and the role of Fgf8 in mediating the function of this signaling center. We will use genetic approaches to ablate or reduce Fgf8 expression in the forebrain and ectoderm of mouse embryos and we will assess formation of the FEZ. Additionally, to distinguish between early and late roles of Fgf8 in FEZ function, we will characterize each FEZ in a novel chimeric system. Our results will contribute to the overall understanding of the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that regulate development of the middle and upper face and will provide a basis to understand how defects in this region arise.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of the face requires a complex series of interactions between the epithelium and the mesenchyme. The different sets of instructive interactions result in patterning of the facial primordia directly linked to both the development of specific craniofacial structures and the fate of specific cells. Secondary palatal development has 3 specific patterning stages, the growth zone phase, dorsal-ventral patterning of the medial edge epithelium in the midline and the anterior-posterior patterning of the palatal shelf. The MEE are dorsal-ventral patterned such that some cells migrate to the oral or nasal surfaces while others undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation. The cell fate of the MEE is established in a dorsal-ventral orientation and regulation of these fates is highly controlled. Anterior-posterior patterning of the palatal shelves regulates timing of palatal fusion and exhibits spatially distinct regulation of the fusion events. The growth zone, dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior patterning of the palatal shelves are regulated locally by specific inductive signals. TGF-B3 has been shown to be 1 critical signaling molecule regulating the fate of the MEE during palatogenesis and has led to the hypothesis that; Medial edge epithelial cell differentiation is controlled by autocrine and paracrine mechanisms that establish growth zone, dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior patterning during palatogenesis. This hypothesis will be tested with 3 specific aims; 1.To determine the factors that regulate MEE differentiation during the growth zone phase of palatogenesis and their relationship to the EGF signaling pathway in these cells; 2.To characterize the dorsal-ventral patterning of the MEE during the fusion of the palatal shelves as defined by cell adhesion molecules and growth factor receptors that determine the specific fates of different populations of MEE; 3) To examine the anterior-posterior patterning of the MEE that defines the different potentials for completion of fusion in the Smad 2 overexpression rescue of the TGF-B3 null mutant.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The neural crest is a multipotent population of embryonic cells with the ability to contribute to a variety of adult derivatives: neural, endocrine, pigment, and mesenchymal. Because neural crest cells have this intrinsic multipotency, they represent a system in which to explore molecular requirements of multipotent stem cells. Stem cells are a unique tissue with the potential for disease therapy and cell transplantation. However, in order to take advantage of these biological possibilities, we must understand the genetic pathways involved, identify stem cell progenitors prospectively and control their maintenance and differentiation. We have identified a transcription factor, Foxd3 that is sufficient to specify neural crest. Foxd3 is required for normal murine development and the establishment of two embryo-derived stem cell lineages: embryonic stem (ES) cells and trophoblast stem (TS) cells. Aim 1 tests the requirement for Foxd3 in vivo to specify and/or maintain neural crest cells. Adult progenitor cells reside in specialized niches and are recruited to renew or repair tissue thereby maintaining homeostasis. Multipotent neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) can be isolated from both embryonic neural crest cells and some postnatal neural crest derivatives. Foxd3 is expressed in NCSCs and in scattered cells of the adult nervous system known to contain progenitor cells. Experiments in Aim 2 will determine the identity of Foxd3 expressing cells in the adult and if these cells are residing in a stem cell niche. Because Foxd3 is required in other stem cell populations, experiments in Aim 3 will determine if Foxd3 plays a role in the establishment and maintenance of postnatally derived neural crest stem cells (NCSCs). These experiments are all linked to the same biological process of establishing and/or maintaining multipotent cell properties in stem cells from different sources. Understanding the molecular regulation of common properties of different stem cell types is critical to understanding how these cells can maintain multipotency as well as how their differentiation might be controlled in vitro and potentially in vivo.

are indispensable for the adaptive immune response. Given that thymus involution and reduced T cell output
are consequences of advancing age or disease, there is considerable interest in therapeutic strategies
aimed at thymus restoration. However, it is essential to understand the cellular interactions and molecular
pathways that are required to generate the thymus de novo during ontogeny in order to devise rational
approaches for its regeneration. This application focuses on the mechanisms by which neural crest-derived
mesenchymal cells regulate development of the epithelial and hematopoietic compartments during thymus
organogenesis. Our preliminary data reveal that neural crest cells (NCCs) play a previously unrecognized
role in patterning 3rd PP endoderm and suggest that NCCs play distinct roles during early and late stages of
thymus organogenesis. The NCC defect in Pax3Sp/Sp embryos results in a boundary shift between thymus
and parathryoid specific domains of the common third pouch primordia. In comparison to wildtype
littermates, the shared primordia of Pax3Sp/Sp mutants have a relatively smaller Gcm2 expressing domain and
a correspondingly larger Foxnl expressing domain. Importantly, overall cellularity is comparable in the
shared primordia of mutant and wildtype littermates. There is neither an increase in the frequency of
proliferating cells, nor a decrease in the frequency of apoptotic cells in the shared primordia of Pax3Sp/Sp
compared to Pax3+/+ littermates. Therefore, the increased number of third pouch endodermal progenitors
that are committed to a thymus fate accounts for the unexpectedly large, albeit ectopic, thymic lobes in
E12.5 Pax3Sp/Sp embryos.
Although the findings appear to be at odds with the general consensus that NCC deficiencies result in
thymus hypoplasia, the likely explanation for this paradox is that NCCs perform distinct functions at different
developmental stages. Initially, NCC-derived signals are required for correct patterning of the third pouch
endoderm. Specific Aims 1 and 2 focus on the molecular mechanisms by which NCCs control thymus versus
parathyroid fate decisions in endodermal progenitors. At a slightly later stage of thymus organogenesis, the
condensing NC-derived mesenchymal capsule produces Fgf7 and FgflO that promote-outgrowth of the
thymus rudiment. It remains to be determined whether NCCs play additional roles in the late fetal and
postnatal thymus. This issue is the central focus of Specific Aim 3.","13874",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the processes which regulate tissue-specific gene expression is an important issue in development biology. Currently, very little is known regarding tissue-specific gene regulation during the later stages of tooth development, especially those associated with root formation. Recent studies have identified nuclear factor I-C (NFI-C) as a critical transcription factor for normal root formation in mice and humans. NFI-C is one of four genes belonging to the NFI gene family. These genes (NFI-A, NFI-B, NFI-C and NFI-X) all exist as multiple protein products and function as cellular transcription factors and adenovirus DNA replication factors. The role of NFI-C in root formation first became evident when Nfi-c knockout mice presented with no molar root formation and severe incisor defects. In humans a similar phenotype of incomplete or absent root formation is observed in patients with the human disease Radicular Dentin Dysplasia (ROD; MIM125400) also known as Rootless Teeth or Dentin Dysplasia Type I. The inheritance pattern of this disease is described as autosomal dominant affecting both deciduous and permanent dentitions. Our laboratory has recently identified a consanguineous family with a novel autosomal recessive (AR) form of ROD. The proband presented with premature exfoliation of his teeth. Dental x-rays revealed no development of any root structures associated with the deciduous or permanent teeth. DNA sequencing analysis of the AR ROD family revealed a mutation in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of NFI-C. This mutation, contained within an element highly conserved across all available species, results in decreased NFI-C mRNA levels. The unique root phenotype in the Nfi-c null mouse and identification of a NFI-C mutation associated with pathogenesis of AR ROD suggests that NFI-C is a critical transcription factor for inductive epithelial mesenchymal signaling leading to root formation. Our hypothesis is that the NFI-C gene expression is regulated in part by a conserved element contained within the 3' UTR region of the gene and that a mutation in this regulatory element results in decrease levels of the protein altering normal signaling cascades for root formation. The information obtained from these studies will provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in normal tooth root development, as well as the root phenotype found in patients presenting with ROD. Eventually the proposed studies will facilitate the development of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic treatments for patients with various diseases or syndrome with altered root formation.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Goals of this proposal are to extend fundamental principles in lung stem cell biology for the development of effective strategies to amplify and purify lung stem cells, deliver them to repair deficient airways, and enhance epithelial reparative capacity. The underlying premise upon which this proposal is based is that defects in the reparative capacity of epithelial cells represent a common factor contributing to the progression of chronic lung disease, and that strategies aimed at enhancing epithelial reparative capacity will be essential components of treatments to effect lung regeneration. To achieve the goals of this proposal we have organized a research team drawing from basic and clinical scientists with expertise in stem cell biology, cell-based therapy, lung injury and repair, and the clinical management of chronic lung disease in humans. The scientific foundation for studies proposed in this application is based upon our previous demonstration that endogenous tissue stem cells are required for maintenance of epithelial reparative capacity, and that potentiation of b-catenin signaling in airways of mice leads to expansion of endogenous stem cells that harbor intrinsic reparative capacity. Accordingly, we hypothesize that pharmacologic interventions capable of transiently activating b-catenin signaling will lead to expansion of endogenous stem cells and enhanced epithelial reparative capacity, and that enriched populations of reparative cells obtained through potentiation of b-catenin signaling can be used for restoration of epithelial reparative capacity in repair-deficient recipient airways. Three aims are proposed that will build a platform upon which cell-based therapies can be further developed. Aim 1 will use transient activation of b-catenin signaling for the amplification of mouse and human airway stem cells. In Aim 2, we will define the cell surface phenotype of bronchiolar stem cells for the prospective purification and enrichment of airway stem cells. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the feasibility of using amplified bronchiolar stem cells for the restoration of reparative capacity in repair-deficient airways. Accomplishing these aims will provide a rational foundation upon which to further develop strategies for the delivery of reparative cells to lung tissue for correction of epithelial repair defects.","611326",

signaling pathway activates expression of target genes and subsequently affects the generation of a
particular cell type, in a context-dependent and temporal manner. The Wnt signaling pathway and its
components are used reiteratively throughout embryonic development and in mature tissues during the
transformation of normal cells to cancerous ones, demonstrating the importance of this pathway. Wnt
signaling plays a significant role in the development of the neural crest, a population of migratory cells that
helps pattern the embryo. Because of its contribution to embryonic structures, defects in neural crest
development give rise to multiple syndromes, diseases, and cancers, including Axenfeld-Rieger, Di George
and Treacher-Collins syndromes, and neurofibromatosis. To further understand how Wnt signaling regulates
neural crest development, I have performed a screen to identify novel targets of Wnt signaling involved in
this process. Furthermore, investigation into the role of known Wnt target genes, such as Snail2 (Slug)
allows me to elucidate how Snail2 regulates expression of its molecular targets in the context of neural crest
development. Embryological and biochemical methods will be employed to determine the functional
significance of these targets and their mode of regulation by Wnt. Overall, these approaches will provide me
with a group of candidate molecules that will likely function in the generation of structures derived from the
neural crest, such as the craniofacial skeleton and peripheral nervous system, as well as provide insight into
the development of neural crest-derived cancers. In summary, my long-term research and career objectives
include conducting mentored research (in the final years of my postdoc) and independent research (as a
principal investigator) to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying Wnt signaling during the
development of the neural crest, and applying this knowledge to human development as a whole.
This research is relevant to public health because of the biological significance of the neural crest to the
proper formation of human bodies, such as the bones of the face, nerves and skin pigment cells. How
neural crest cells properly become such diverse structures can help us comprehend what happens when
neural crest development is impaired, and human syndromes and cancers arise.","244021",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
Aortic valve calcification/stenosis is the third leading cause of adult heart disease and the most common form of acquired valvular disease in developed countries. The risk factors most closely linked to calcific aortic stenosis are the presence of a bicuspid aortic valve, increased age, male gender, smoking, hypertension, and elevated lipoproteins. Examination of human calcified aortic valve tissue has shown that several pathologic pathways are involved. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in valvular calcification have not been elucidated. Recently, the Srivastava lab reported two human families in which mutations in NOTCH1 were associated with early calcification of the aortic valve and bicuspid aortic valves. Notchl is a part of a highly conserved signaling pathway involved in many cellular events, including cell fate decisions and cell differentiation. This study demonstrated that Hrt2, a transcriptional represser that mediates the Notchl signal, could regulate the activity of Runx2, a central regulator of osteoblast cell fate determination in vitro. Our preliminary data show that Notchl heterozygous mice develop increased aortic valve calcification as compared to wild-type age matched littermates. I hypothesize that Notchl signaling represses pro-osteogenic pathways in aortic valve mesenchyme and that Notchl disruption may sensitize the valve to known risk factors that promote calcification. Specific Aim 1: To determine if disrupting Notchl signaling causes calcification of the aortic valve by activation of osteogenic pathways in mice. Notchl signaling will be conditionally disrupted in aortic valve tissue valves prenatally or postnatally. The aortic valves will be examined for functional stenosis, calcification, and expression of genes involved in bone formation. In addition, Notchl-deficient mice will be crossed with a mouse model of hyperlipidemia to examine the contribution of this risk factor to Notchl-mediated aortic valve calcification. Specific Aim 2: To elucidate the calcific pathways mediated by Notchl in mesenchymal and endocardial cells. Notchl expression will be disrupted or enhanced in cultured mesenchymal and endocardial cells under various conditions. Mesenchymal cells will be examined for activation or repression of osteoblast-specific gene expression and in some cases deposition of calcium. The interactions between Notchl signaling and three molecular pathways previously implicated in cardiovascular calcification, namely Runx2, Bmp2, and Wnt, will be examined.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A number of the specific steps in tumor dissemination have been extensively modeled, and molecularly dissected. However, one early step in the metastatic cascade, namely intravasation, the entry of escaping tumor cells into the vasculature, has been relatively understudied. One of the reasons for this is that up to now human tumor cell phenotypic variants that exhibit substantial differences in their intravasation ability have not been available for comparative analysis. Our laboratory reported the selection and isolation of two variants of a human fibrosarcoma cell line (HT-1080) that dramatically differ (50-100 fold) in their intravasation rate, yielding a similar >50 fold differential in their metastatic capabilities. These two tumor dissemination variants, HT- hi/diss and HT-lo/diss, were selected and monitored in the chick embryo model, where primary human tumors developing on the embryo's chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), recapitulate the multi-step tumor dissemination process and form micro metastatic foci in a number of secondary organs. We have also tested the two fibrosarcoma variants in different mouse metastasis assays and confirmed the substantial differential in their tumor dissemination capabilities. These two congenic, intravasation variants are thus suitable for a comparative analysis of early metastatic events. Therefore, in Specific Aim 1 we propose to molecularly dissect three physiological/pathological processes which determine the outcome of tumor cell intravasation events, i.e. induction of angiogenesis, stromal invasion and vasculotropism. We will analyze the functional role of select molecules contributing to the events involved in tumor cell intravasation including; inflammatory cell MMP-9; FGF-2; uPA; and tumor cell MMP-14. Unique assays for tumor cell interaction with blood vessels will be used to identify contributory molecules involved in the vasculotropic event. Mouse models for tumor cell dissemination and angiogenesis will be used to complement the chick embryo models for examining the identified molecules in the two fibrosarcoma variants. There exists however, a distinct lack of other tumor cell intravasation variants to compare and contrast and this is especially relevant for carcinomas, the major cancer in the human population. Therefore for Specific Aim 2 we propose to identify specific proteins which contribute mechanistically to the intravasation step in carcinoma dissemination by employing carcinoma variants selected in vivo for differential rates of intravasation. We will generate pairs of high and low intravasating variants from human prostate, colon and pancreatic carcinoma cell lines. Functional proteomic approaches will be applied both in vitro and in vivo to the selected carcinoma variants to verify and/or complement the cellular mechanisms and contributory molecules identified in fibrosarcoma-derived variants. The influence of mesenchymal fibroblasts and their products on the disseminating properties of the carcinoma variants will also be quantified. Novel mechanistic information about carcinoma cell intravasation will provide molecular links to a specific step in tumor dissemination, namely intravasation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Deaths from cancer occur mainly because tumor cells spread from the primary tumor site to other vital organs and tissues. The tumor spread is usually through the vasculature. In order for tumor cells to escape from the primary tumor and enter the vasculature they alter some of their cellular processes by producing different levels of functioning molecules. The goal of the proposed research is to identify the relevant molecules and cellular processes that contribute to tumor cell spread so that clinical intervention can target those critical molecules and processes.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This competitive renewal extends the successful work (35 published papers) funded under 5R01GM076692-01 Multiscale Studies of Segmentation in Vertebrate Embryos to develop multiscale simulation tools for the simulation of somite formation in chicken. The strategic context of the current proposal is to unify the multiple accomplishments achieved during the original funding period into a coherent model of somitogenesis and to deliver the primary recommendation of the NIH-led Interagency Modeling and Analysis Group (IMAG) Miniworkshop and Principal Investigator's Meeting on Model Sharing, April 11-12, 2007: ""a focused demonstration project for multiscale simulation techniques, which addresses a well- defined, specific problem in developmental biology, which includes a variety of biological mechanisms of importance throughout development and for which a unified multiscale approach is essential."" Chick somitogenesis is an excellent choice of demonstration project because it is well- characterized experimentally, requires simulation of most fundamental developmental mechanisms, and requires both the unification of existing methodologies at multiple scales (in this case merging the widely-employed, open-source software packages Systems Biology Workbench (SBW) for subcellular modeling and CompuCell3D (CC3D) for multicell modeling into a Tissue-Simulation Environment (TSE)) and the development of a number of key additional software components of broad utility in developmental-biology simulation and in critical biomedical areas such as cancer and vascular research. This proposal leverages the investment NIGMS has recently made in software infrastructure development under 1R01GM077138-01A1 to Glazier and 1R01GM081070-01A1 to Sauro, which, while they greatly increase the scope of CC3D and SBW separately (by supporting improved user interfaces for model generation, execution and analysis; enhanced scripting- language support, development of testing and validation modules, improving documentation, training materials and user support), do not cover the development or parallelization of a merged SBW/CC3D, or the deployment of a biologically-meaningful demonstration project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Simulations of cell interactions and underlying molecular mechanisms during embryonic development can play a vital role in experimental biomedical research, help with the interpretation of experimental results, suggest experiments, predict experimental outcomes and lead to a deeper understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms, thus expediting the understanding of diseases and the development of treatment strategies. Successful completion of the presented research plan will improve the involvement of medical institutions and industry, and their interaction in the development of modeling tools and their effective use in the creation of novel drugs and treatments.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Disseminated intra-abdominal metastasis is the leading cause of death for women with epithelial ovarian carcinoma, indicating that intervention with the metastatic process may significantly improve long-term survival of ovarian cancer patients.  Acquisition of the metastatic phenotype involves a complex series of interrelated cellular events leading to dissociation (shedding) of malignant cells from the primary tumor.  A key event in this process is disruption of cell-cell contacts via modulation of intercellular junctional components.  The overall goal of this project is to define the interrelationships between events that contribute to dissemination of malignant cells, as a more detailed understanding of these processes will translate into novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.  A unique feature of primary well-differentiated ovarian cancers is an increase in expression of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, with subsequent loss of   
E-cadherin expression and/or function during progression to metastasis.  Our current findings indicate that ligand-, mutational-, or trans-activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) modulates key cellular events required for junction dissolution and subsequent cellular dissemination.  Proposed experiments will test the hypothesis that microenvironmental factors influence metastatic dissemination by initiating cross-talk between activated EGFR and cadherins, thereby modulating E-cadherin expression and function, resulting in shedding of metastatic cells from the primary tumor.  To address this hypothesis, Aim 1 will evaluate microenvironmental regulators of E-cadherin junctional integrity by examining the effect of EGFR activation on modulation of E-cadherin expression, function and trafficking.  The impact of E-cadherin functional downregulation on acquisition of mesenchymal markers and proteinase expression will also be evaluated.  Aim 2 will characterize the kinetics of proteolytic release of the E-cadherin ectodomain (sE-cadherin) and evaluate the effects of sE-cadherin on cell-cell adhesion and cellular dispersion using organotypic dissemination models.  Translational studies proposed in Aim 3 will evaluate the relationship between EGFR activation, proteinase expression, cadherin status and ectodomain shedding in ovarian tumor microarrays and investigate microenvironmental regulators in ascites.  The proposed integrative analysis will fill significant gaps in knowledge and provide novel data regarding (a) E- and N-cadherin status of early and late stage tumors and metastases, (b) EGFR activation and EMT in ovarian tumor progression from well- to poorly- differentiated tumors, and (c) the presence of soluble microenvironmental regulators positioned for sustained interaction with tumor tissues.  Relevance:  The proposed studies utilize a novel integrative approach to address molecular mechanisms that potentiate ovarian cancer metastasis.  A major clinical need remains for ovarian cancer-specific therapies that target metastatic disease.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of the developmental regulation of tooth number and shape is important for understanding human disease. Mammalian tooth development is controlled by signaling between the oral epithelium and the neural crest-derived ectomesenchyme. These interactions are mediated by several signaling pathways, including those activated by Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs) via binding to FGF receptor- tyrosine kinases. Members of the Sprouty family modulate FGF signaling by antagonizing it downstream of the receptor. In my previous work, I have shown that inactivation of Spry2 or Spry4 results in the formation of supernumerary teeth in the diastema, a normally toothless region between the incisors and molars of mice. These supernumerary teeth result from hypersensitivity of the odontogenic epithelium or mesenchyme to FGF signaling. In this application, I will pursue the observation that inactivation of multiple Sprouty alleles has profound effects on incisor development. Embryos that are null for Spry4 and heterozygous for Spry2 have supernumerary incisors in the maxilla and remarkable tusk-like incisors in the mandible. Embryos that are null for two Sprouty genes also develop supernumerary incisors, although the morphology of these incisors varies depending on the genotype. The first group of experiments will test the hypothesis that the tusk-like incisor phenotype is caused by effects on stem cells in the adult incisor. I will analyze the role of FGFs and other signaling molecules in regulation of incisor stem cells. The second group of experiments in this proposal is aimed at elucidating the normal mechanisms that control the number and morphology of incisors, as well as the role of Sprouty genes in these processes. Results from these studies will enhance our understanding of the molecular pathways that control epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during tooth organogenesis and may help lead to innovative treatments for patients with dental defects, including even the possibility of bioengineering new teeth. The studies proposed here employ a genetic approach to determine the functions of the Sprouty (Spry) genes in mouse tooth development. Public health implications: By studying the functions of the Sprouty gene family, we will learn more about how teeth normally develop and will understand more about the basis for dental abnormalities. We will also study the role of adult stem cells in teeth, which may help to lay the groundwork for efforts to build new teeth.

combines basic science research with clinical research. Basic studies focus on the role of monocyte-derived
chemokines in the regulation of hematopoiesis, using in-vitro systems that model the marrow
microenvironment (ME). Clinical correlates come from a comparative analysis of normal monocytes with
those from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), where abnormal monocyte function may be
associated with pathogenesis. The training program involves scientific investigation and didactic study under
the mentorship of Dr. Beverly Torok-Storb and Dr. Rainer Storb. The applicant will also benefit from the
guidance of Dr. Joachim Deeg and Dr. Larry Rohrschneider, who will be part of his advisory committee.
 The regulation of hematopoiesis is complex, involving several different cell types, working in concert in the
context of the ME. Preliminary data indicate that monocytes, which are an integral component of the ME
secrete a chemokine, CXCL7, in response to stromal signals. CXCL7 peptides, previously reported to be
derived only from cells of the megakaryocyte lineage, are reported to augment fibroblast growth and inhibit
platelet production. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that stromal-stimulated monocyte-derived
CXCL7 peptides also affect the function of the ME. In addition, given that preliminary data suggest abnormal
CXCL7 gene expression in monocytes from MDS patients, a second hypothesis to be tested is that
abnormal patterns of CXCL7 expression in monocytes may contribute to pathogenesis in these patients.
 Three Specific Aims are proposed to test these hypotheses: (1) Using appropriate bioassays, the effect of
CXCL7 peptides on the ME will be characterized using different forms of the peptide generated as
recombinant proteins. (2) Abnormal patterns of CXCL7 expression by MDS-derived monocytes will be
identified and correlated with clinical data to establish an association between abnormal expression and
pathogenesis. (3) The stromal signals and subsequent molecular events responsible for the up regulation of
CXCL7 gene expression in normal monocytes will be identified. This will allow for eventual delineation of
mechanisms responsible for aberrant expression in MDS monocytes. Data from these studies should
contribute to a precise understanding of the consequences of normal and MDS monocyte interactions within
the ME, which in turn should lead to the development of novel interventions.","25384",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The lens capsule is a thickened basement membrane that completely surrounds the lens from its earliest developmental stages until death. It is well established that the lens capsule is crucial for lens development and function and lens capsule pathologies can threaten vision. An established function of the lens capsule is to serve as a selectable filter between the lens and the ocular environment, however, relatively little is known about the properties of this filter. During the prior grant cycle, we developed a robust fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) protocol which can evaluate both the ability of molecules to enter the lens capsule and quantitatively determine their diffusion coefficient. In the first aim of this application, we propose to use FRAP to elucidate the molecular properties of the normal lens capsule filter. It is also known that mutations in extracellular matrix (ECM) protein genes result in cataract. The second aim tests the hypothesis that alterations in collagen IV activate the unfolded protein response leading to cataract. Another established function of the lens capsule is to engage ECM receptors on lens cells, providing both a structural anchor for the cell and inducing cell signaling cascades crucial for lens cell phenotype. Integrins are a major class of ECM receptors present on lens cells and ¿1 integrin is the major b-integrin subunit expressed by the lens. In the prior grant cycle, we created mice lacking ¿1 integrin in either all lens cells or just lens fibers to test the hypothesis that ¿1-integrin is important for lens cell/lens capsule communication. The phenotypes of the resulting animals are quite distinct and we now propose in specific aim three to elucidate the function of ¿1-integrin in the in vivo lens by analyzing the molecular abnormalities seen in these animals. Public Health Relevance: The lens capsule is important for the function of the normal ocular lens, although little is known about how diseases affecting the lens capsule result in lens abnormalities. Further, the lens capsule is usually retained in the eye after the surgical removal of cataracts to both support the implanted artificial replacement lens and to serve as a barrier, between the anterior and posterior portions of the eye, although the resulting abnormal lens cell/capsule interactions often result in secondary cataract. A complete understanding of the communication between lens cells and the capsule are crucial to develop treatments to prevent secondary cataract.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer incidence has been increasing over the past 50 years, and is now the second leading cause of death among American women. In an attempt to find the reasons, environmental exposure and dietary factors are being studied. The NF-?B family of transcription factors plays critical roles in many diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular, pulmonary disease, obesity and diabetes. NF-?B factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive complex in almost all non-B cells. Surprisingly, aberrant activation of NF-?B was observed in rat mammary tumors induced by the prototypic carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and over 95% of primary human breast cancer specimens. Inhibition of NF-?B induced apoptosis or slowed growth, while an MMTV-c-Rel transgenic mouse showed that c-Rel can play a causal role in late onset mammary tumorigenesis. Importantly, mutant Ras and Her-2/neu overexpression, which can be induced by DMBA exposure, were found to activate NF-?B. DMBA activated multiple NF-?B complexes in mouse mammary tumors and in a c-Rel-driven mammary cancer cell line. More recently, the PI's lab has identified a de novo RelB synthesis pathway, shown that RelB promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of breast cancer, demonstrated that induction of the IKK5/i kinase in human breast tumors and cell lines plays an important role in maintenance of NF-?B activity and transformation, and implicated CK2 in IKK5/i activation. In this revised application, the PI proposes to test the central hypothesis that genetic and epigenetic alterations mediated by environmental carcinogens converge to induce or enhance the activity of multiple NF-?B complexes, thereby promoting a more invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells. Thus, inhibition of NF-?B will revert the malignant phenotype. Cancer epidemiological studies have shown an inverse association between green tea consumption and breast cancer incidence. Green tea is rich in polyphenols (GTPs) with anti-oxidant properties; the most abundant is epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG). EGCG inhibits activation of NF-?B by Her- 2/neu signaling. Recently, green tea or EGCG was shown to reduce the invasive phenotype of DMBA-induced rat mammary tumors and Rel-driven cells in culture, and to slow proliferation of Her-2/neu breast cancer cell lines resistant to trastuzumab. In this revised new RO1 application, three aims are proposed: to (1) elucidate the roles of NF-?B complexes in promoting transformation; (2) elucidate the functional roles of IKK5/i in mammary carcinogenesis and the mechanism of IKK5/i promoter activation; (3) perform pre-clinical animal testing of the ability of GTPs to inhibit growth of Her-2/neu cancers, including those resistant to trastuzumab. Positive findings can readily be translated to the clinic. Important information on the roles of individual NF-?B complexes that are aberrantly activated by environmental carcinogens or oncogenes in promoting invasive breast cancer will be forthcoming; findings should be applicable to wide-spectrum of diseases involving NF-?B. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. This application focuses on the potential role of environmental exposure in the increase in breast cancer incidence in American women, and specifically on a family of nuclear factors (NF-?B family) that have become a target for therapy in a wide spectrum of diseases, including cancer. Carcinogens induce overexpression or mutation in cancer-causing genes that signal via this family of factors, and the PI's group has identified new pathways leading to their expression and shown that green tea components can reverse their activation, even in cells resistant to commonly used therapies. Thus, pre-clinical testing of green tea components on breast cancer cells that are resistant to antibody therapy will be performed, and if successful, this approach can readily be translated to the clinic.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Maternal smoking during pregnancy causes a broad range of effects on the developing lung of the fetus that greatly impairs its long-term function and capacity. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are not known. Since both normal lung development and injury/repair utilize common alveolar epithelial-mesenchymal signaling pathways to maintain homeostasis, we propose that in utero nicotine exposure disrupts the critical homeostatic epithelial-mesenchymal paracrine signaling pathways, resulting in the transdifferentiation of alveolar intersitial fibroblasts (AIFs) to myofibroblasts (MYFs). This AIF-to-MYF transdifferentiation is characterized by down regulation of the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor gamma (PPAR() signaling pathway and up regulation of the Wingless/Int (Wnt) signaling pathway. Although the effects of in utero nicotine exposure on PPAR( signaling have recently been described, there is no information on its effect on the Wnt signaling in the developing lung. We hypothesize that in utero nicotine exposure up-regulates AIF Wnt signaling and that by specific molecular targeting to down regulate the Wnt signaling and/or up regulate the PPAR( signaling, in utero nicotine-induced lung injury can be prevented or even reversed. Using well established in vitro and in vivo models of in utero nicotine-induced lung injury, through real-time RT- PCR, Western analysis, immunohistochemistry, laser capture microdissection, metabolomics, antisense and over expression studies, and in vivo pulmonary function tests, we will determine (1) how in utero nicotine exposure alters lung development, resulting in altered structure and function, and (2) if PPAR( agonists and/or Wnt antagonists, either alone or in combination, can prevent and/or reverse perinatal nicotine exposure-induced alterations in PPAR( and Wnt signaling in lung mesenchyme, and hence lung structure and function. Since the paradigm and models used by us are based on a universal developmental model for the formation, establishment, and homeostasis of the alveolar acinus, the information generated will not be limited only to in utero nicotine-induced injury but is likely to have a much larger applicability to lung development and injury/repair in general. Therefore, by utilizing functional genomics, the studies proposed herein are likely to translate into novel and innovative molecular preventive and therapeutic approaches for all chronic lung diseases in general. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Maternal smoking during pregnancy poses significant risks not only during gestation and immediate newborn period, but may also results in life long medical complications including devastating respiratory problems. The mechanisms underlying the harmful effects of maternal smoking on the lung are complex and incompletely understood. Using novel and innovative concepts, and the state-of-the-art technology, the proposed studies will unravel mechanisms that underlie not only the in utero smoke exposure-induced lung injury, but also almost all other forms of chronic lung diseases.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  During early mammalian development, a sequence of morphogenetic movements define the anterior-posterior body axis, create the germ layers, organize the midline and elongate the embryo to generate the correct spatial arrangement of tissues and organs. Little is known about how intercellular signals control these behaviors of cells and tissues during development. Here, genetic approaches are used to define the proteins and gene networks that regulate these morphogenetic events. A forward genetic screen has successfully identified a large number of chemically-induced mutations that disrupt morphogenesis of the embryo. The tools of mouse molecular genetics have been used to identify the genes responsible for the developmental defects of the mutants. Most of these genes had not been studied previously. This approach will be continued: additional mutants identified in the screen will be characterized and focused reporter-based screens will identify more of the genes that regulate embryonic morphogenesis. To move from single genes to the gene networks that regulate morphogenesis, experiments will determine how actin regulators identified in the screen are linked to developmental signals. Mutations identified in the screen will be used to define the gene networks that control morphogenesis in two embryonic tissues, the node and the neural plate. The embryonic node is required for organization of the midline and for left-right asymmetry. Both Notch signaling and the FERM domain protein Lulu/Epb4.1l5 are required for the proper formation of the node. Experiments will test whether Notch signaling controls node morphogenesis through Lulu-mediated actin rearrangements or if Lulu is required for Notch signaling. Closure of the neural plate into the neural tube depends on signaling by the planar polarity pathway. Genetic experiments suggest that Cofilin1, another actin regulator, may mediate planar polarity-dependent cell reorganization, and experiments will test this hypothesis. These studies will provide a foundation for understanding the genetic networks that link intercellular signals to cell behavior during mammalian development. Birth defects are caused by errors in morphogenesis. The proposed studies will define the genes and mechanisms that are responsible for congenital malformations such as situs inversus and neural tube defects. In addition, the same genes that direct embryonic morphogenesis are of critical importance in metastasis. For example, Cofilin1 and other actin regulators are upregulated during metastasis and promote the movement of tumor cells. The proposed studies will define how these actin regulators function in the intact embryos and tissues, which is certain to parallel their roles in tumor metastasis.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Normal mammalian development and the abnormal development of tumors are regulated by intercellular signals that direct cell migration and cell rearrangements. Disruption of these processes leads to birth defects and metastasis. Genetic experiments will define proteins and gene networks that regulate cell behavior in response to extracellular signals during mammalian development.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): 1 of the major obstacles in tissue engineering of thick, complex tissues (such as the heart and the liver) is the need to vascularize the tissue in vitro. Vascularization in vitro could restore cells viability during growth of the tissue, induce structural organization and promote integration upon implantation. Embryonic stem (ES) cells have the capability to differentiate and form blood vessels de novo in a process called vasculogenesis. We have shown that human ES (hES) cells can differentiate into endothelial cells (ECs) forming vascular-like structures when formation of embryoid bodies is induced and that these cells can be isolated and grown in culture. We hypothesize that the vasculogenic potential of hES-derived endothelial progenitors can be used to induce vascularization in engineered human tissue. Our goal will be to induce vasculogenesis in engineered tissue constructs grown on three dimensional (3D) polymer scaffolds. We will use co culture systems of embryonic endothelial and cardiac cells cultured on biodegradable polymer scaffolds designed to meet cellular and mechanical properties needed for a cardiac patch. The vascularized constructs will be implanted and examined for integration with the host vasculature. We hypothesize that the vessel network created in vitro will promote the vascularization of the tissue in vivo.","335495",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cellular repair response to damaged articular cartilage that has been characterized by traditional light microscopic technology suggests reactivation of the same chondrocyte lineage that initially formed the growth plate cartilage. However identifying the cellular components of the lineage within adult cartilage is not possible with available technology, nor is it possible to test the hypothesis that cells within the articular cartilage are derived from a distinctly different limb of the chondrocyte lineage. This proposal is designed to introduce a new tool set of genetic markers for lineage studies in the chondrocytes that form the articular and growth plate cartilage. Based on our prior experience of building and validating promoter-GFP reporter transgenic mice for studying the osteoprogenitor lineage, a similar strategy is proposed for the chondrocyte lineage. The plan integrates input from four different investigators and combines the molecular skills of recombineering and BAC transgenesis, early limb developmental biology and GFP fluorescence imaging in living cell and fixed histological section. The genetic units for driving GFP have been chosen from early limb development studies as likely candidates to identify cells at defined stages of differentiation. A proven protocol for the rapid production of BAC-GFP constructs has been selected. The methods for the rapid screening of BAC transgenic mice, obtained from existing colonies or produced in house, will identify genetic units which can either alone or in combination be used to identify a definable level of chondrocyte differentiation. The hypothesis that this technology driven grant will test is that the chondrocytes of the articular cartilage have a distinctly different pathway of differentiation than the chondrocytes that form the growth plate. Specifically, articular chondrocytes develop from the interzone cells of the developing joint which ultimately give rise to many of the structures of the synovial joint. Following this reasoning, the genetic unit that will be tested for the growth plate chondrocytes will include: mesenchymal chondrogenic progenitor cells in the developing limb, FGF10; prechondrocytes (precartilage condensation), Sox9 and Col1a1; proliferating chondrocytes, Sox9 and Col2a1; prehypertrophic chondrocytes, IHH; hypertrophic chondrocytes, Col10a1. The genetic units to identify cell of the articular lineage will include: pre-interzone cells, Dlx5 and Col2a1; interzone cells, Gdf5; early articular chondrocytes, Pg4 (lubricin) and mature articular cells, tnc (tenascin c) and Col2a1. The validated genetic units for lineage identification produced from this proposal will be made available to the chondrocyte community and will form the basis for more advanced expression constructs for fate mapping, directed and inducible expression, multiplexing and vector delivery.   
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Visual markers that report the level of differentiation within the chondrocyte lineage will be a significant advance for studying diseases of articular cartilage. Knowing the relative distribution of cells from progenitor to fully differentiated, particularly if articular and growth plate cartilage arise from a different branch, will give fundamental insight into cellular pathogenesis and point to agents which might alter lineage progression in a positive direction. However the greatest application of the GFP reporters may be in regenerative medicine in which progenitor cells from a donor (marked with one reporter color) are implanted into the articular cartilage of an injured host (marked with another color). This approach will indicate the success of the donor to differentiate to the appropriate cell type and integrate with the host articular chondrocytes. Current markers cannot make this distinction that has restrained progress in developing chondrocyte progenitors that can be directed to form articular cartilage. The GFP tool set that this grant will produce will be the first step in a more knowledge based approach to regenerative medicine for diseases of the joint.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endochondral bone formation involves condensation and differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes followed by chondrocyte proliferation, maturation, hypertrophic differentiation and apoptosis. Each step of the endochondral bone formation process is precisely regulated by local growth factors, signaling molecules and transcription factors, including TGF-b, b-catenin and Runx2. TGF-b promotes chondrocyte proliferation but prevents chondrocyte differentiation and hypertrophy. The molecular mechanisms of TGF-b action in chondrocytes are not fully understood. In preliminary studies, we have made two key novel discoveries: 1) TGF-b activates b-catenin signaling in chondrocytes in a Smad5-dependent manner and TGF-b-induced cyclin D1 expression is mediated by b-catenin; and 2) cyclin D1 induces Runx2 phosphorylation and degradation. In the proposed studies, we will use comprehensive molecular and genetic approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms through which TGF-b activates b-catenin signaling and inhibits Runx2 function in chondrocytes. The underlying hypothesis for this proposal is that TGF-b stimulates chondrocyte proliferation by increasing cyclin D1 expression which in turn inhibits Runx2 function, thereby preventing onset of chondrocyte differentiation. Two specific aims are proposed in this application. In specific aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms of TGF-b-induced b-catenin signaling during chondrocyte proliferation. We will 1) identify the specific domain of b-catenin that binds to Smad3 and examine if Smad3 interaction prevents b-catenin degradation; 2) determine whether Smad3 enhances b-catenin nuclear translocation; and 3) investigate the mechanisms through which Smad3 and b-catenin cooperatively activate cyclin D1 gene transcription in chondrocytes. In specific aim 2, we will define the molecular mechanism through which cyclin D1 mediates Runx2 degradation in proliferating chondrocytes. We propose 1) to determine if cyclin D1 induces Runx2 phosphorylation and degradation in chondrocytes; 2) to identify the specific E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for cyclin D1-induced Runx2 ubiquitination; and 3) to determine the role of Cdks and Cdk inhibitor in Runx2 degradation and chondrocyte differentiation. The findings from proposed studies will provide novel insights into the role of TGF-b in growth plate chondrocyte development and the mechanisms controlling endochondral bone formation.

superfamily. It is known that lipocalins bind and transport small chemicals ligands, but little has beenknown
about Ngal, and some of its presumptive ligands have been disproved. We purified Ngal from liters of media
conditioned by an embryonic cell line, which revealed a growthfactor with a reddish color. The cloned
protein was also colored and x-ray crystallography of the cloned protein (R. Strong, Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center) showed that it contained a siderophore:Fe complex that it had bound during cloning. Using
recombinant Ngal we could induce growth and conversion of mesenchymeinto epithelia, tubule and
nephrons, but only when rNgal was loaded with this siderophore and iron. This suggested that Ngal's
inductive action must have been due to its ligand, and we speculate that perhaps a mammalian versionof
the siderophore is present in vivo.
Ngal is one of the most overexpressed proteins in ischemic disease of the kidney (>1000 fold increases). It is
also the earliest known protein to be increased in the urine and in the serum of ischemic and toxicdiseases
of the kidney. In situ hybridization shows that Ngal is massively expressed by TALH and collecting ducts.
In this grant we propose to study the activity of the endogenous Ngal protein. We will do this by completing
an isolation of a small organic molecule that binds Ngal and binds iron. The Ngal ligand is found in
mammalian urine. We will identify the structure of this compound using IR, NMR, Mass spectroscopyand x-
ray crystallography. To further examine the function of Ngal in the kidney we have deleted its gene in a
tissue specific manner. Because Ngal previously had a protective function in an ischemic model of the
kidney, we will examine whether the Ngal knockout is more sensitive to ischemia reperfusion injury. We will
test the hypothesis that the Ngal:urine siderophore complex removescatalytic iron and converselythe Ngal
knockout contains more catalytic iron and iron mediated cell damage. The knockout will then be rescuedby
exogenous Ngal or iron chelators. This work is important because it characterizes a novel growth factorthat
is massively expressed by damaged renal epithelia and it evaluates a novel iron transport pathwaythat
appears critical to Ngal function.","326198",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
This proposal is designed to provide the Principal Investigator, Manoj Pillai, with a training experience that combines basic science research with clinical research. Basic studies focus on the role of monocyte-derived chemokines in the regulation of hematopoiesis, using in-vitro systems that model the marrow microenvironment (ME). Clinical correlates come from a comparative analysis of normal monocytes with those from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), where abnormal monocyte function may be associated with pathogenesis. The training program involves scientific investigation and didactic study under the mentorship of Dr. Beverly Torok-Storb and Dr. Rainer Storb. The candidate will also benefit from the guidance of Dr. Joachim Deeg and Dr. Larry Rohrschneider, who will be part of his advisory committee.  
The regulation of hematopoiesis is complex, involving several different cell types, working in concert in the context of the ME. Preliminary data indicate that monocytes, which are an integral component of the ME secrete a chemokine, CXCL7, in response to stromal signals. CXCL7 peptides, previously reported to be derived only from cells of the megakaryocyte lineage, are reported to augment fibroblast growth and inhibit platelet production. The proposed studies will test the hypothesis that stromal-stimulated monocyte-derived CXCL7 peptides also affect the function of the ME. In addition, given that preliminary data suggest abnormal CXCL7 gene expression in monocytes from MDS patients, a second hypothesis to be tested is that abnormal patterns of CXCL7 expression in monocytes may contribute to pathogenesis in these patients.  
Three Specific Aims are proposed to test these hypotheses: (1) Using appropriate bioassays, the effect of CXCL7 peptides on the ME will be characterized using different forms of the peptide generated as recombinant proteins. (2) Abnormal patterns of CXCL7 expression by MDS-derived monocytes will be identified and correlated with clinical data to establish an association between abnormal expression and pathogenesis. (3) The stromal signals and subsequent molecular events responsible for the up regulation of CXCL7 gene expression in normal monocytes will be identified. This will allow for eventual delineation of mechanisms responsible for aberrant expression in MDS monocytes. Data from these studies should contribute to a precise understanding of the consequences of normal and MDS monocyte interactions within the ME, which in turn should lead to the development of novel interventions

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
The goal of this research is to investigate how glucocorticoids (GCs) regulate the differentiation of pluripotent cells into adipocytes and the role of myostatin, a GC regulated gene, in directing this process. The long term objectives are to understand how GCs, acting via their receptor (GR), influence cell fate determination and differentiation. GCs have been used to therapeutically induce differentiation of a broad range of cell types including premature lung tissue in the fetus and immature malignancies such as leukemia and neuroblastoma. GCs have also been used as therapy for a wide range of medical conditions including transplant rejection, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. Interestingly, the side effects of GC excess have a signifcant overlap with the signs and symptoms of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. However, a direct connection between GC activity and the development of the metabolic syndrome has yet to be elucidated. The aim of this study study is to examine the hypothesis that the same pathways involved in GC regulation of cell fate determination and differentiation programs may contribute to the development of some of the side effects found in patients with GC excess such as obesity and insulin resistance. The overall goal is to understand how GCs regulate cell fate and the role this pathway plays in both physiology and disease. This project will focus on the regulation of a GC target gene (myostatin) and the implications of this regulation on: cell fate determination, adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. There are three specific aims: (1) to investigate the regulation of myostatin by GCs in pluripotent mesenchymal cells in order to assess the effect on cell fate determination, (2) to analyze of the role of GR and myostatin in adipogenesis in vivo, and (3) to evaluate the role of GR in adipocyte differentiation and in the pathophysiological changes in GC related diseases and determine if myostatin is relevant to GR's role in these diseases. This project will use molecular biology techniques and genetically modified mouse models, including transgenics and knock-outs, to elucidate the mechanisms by which GCs regulate myostatin with a focus on adipocyte cell fate. This research will provide insight into the cause of the debilitating side effects of GC therapy that millions of people suffer from. In addition, it will shed light on the mechanisms of GC action which has important implications for understanding the development of diseases such as diabetes.

DESCRIPTION: Among all epithelial tissues, the corneal epithelium is most unique in the easy access of its stem cells (SCs) in the limbal region separable from its transient amplifying cells (TACs). In the last funding period, we have gathered strong laboratory and preclinical data supporting the hypotheses that ex vivo expansion of limbal epithelial SCs can be achieved by culturing on amniotic membrane (AM), and that such an ex vivo expanded tissue can be used for a short term to maintain a limbal epithelial phenotype after engraftment to nude mice, and for a long term to restore a normal corneal surface after engraftment to rabbit limbal deficient corneas.  To exploit further potentials of limbal SCs, it is important to understand how SC fate decision in self renewal and progeny production is regulated by its niche. This application explores the regulatory mechanism of TGF-beta signaling by TACs in a serum-free, fibroblast-free and matrix-free niche (Aim 1), by amniotic epithelial cells and stroma in AM as a surrogate (ex vivo) niche (Aim 2), and by limbal fibroblasts in the limbal stroma as the native (in situ) niche (Aims 3 and 4). Completion of these studies will shed new light on how a progeny may exert a feedback control on SC fate. The novel method of isolating and expanding limbal SCs by eliminating TAC's influence will help isolate other SCs in the body, identify potential SC marker(s), and can also be used as a new cell source for tissue engineering in the future. Furthermore, amniotic epithelial cells may be used as a feeder layer and HA-containing stroma matrix may be used to substitute AM to  
expand limbal SCs in the future. Limbal fibroblasts can be impregnated on the stromal side of AM as a new strategy of bio-engineering a surgical graft to replace the limbal tissue. The role of ""irreversible epithelial-mesenchymal transition"" of limbal SCs into fibroblasts and myofibroblasts radically changes our view of how limbal stem cell deficiency develops under inflammation. The new knowledge thus gathered will lead us to develop other new surgical reconstructive strategies of treating corneal blinding diseases inflicted by limbal stem cell deficiency such as chemical/thermal burns, Stevens Johnson syndrome (Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis) and a variety of cicatricial surface disorders, as well as novel therapeutics in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering based on adult SCs and their novel matrix niches in the future.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROPOSAL SUMMARY This application requests partial funding in support of the 2008 Basement Membranes Gordon Research Conference, to be held June 22-27 at the University of New England in Biddeford, ME. This will be the fourteenth in a highly successful series of conferences that have been major international forums for dissemination of new ideas regarding the structure and function of basement membranes. Basement membranes are complex, three-dimensional, extracellular structures formed at epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces and around mesenchymal cells. They play crucial roles in the organization and function of most tissues and organs, including muscle, skin, blood vessels, brain, heart, lung, kidney, and peripheral nerves. Mutations in genes encoding basement membrane components result in severe inherited disorders in humans, e.g. epidermolysis bullosa of skin, congenital muscular dystrophies with associated neural defects, and Alport and Pierson syndromes of kidney. Acquired defects in basement membranes contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic microvascular disease and nephropathy and are involved in metastasis of cancer cells. Traditionally, this conference has attracted both senior and junior scientists from a wide range of fields, including protein and carbohydrate structure, gene expression, cell and developmental biology, pathology, and neurobiology. In addition, it has been attended by clinicians and scientists involved in research and/or treatment of human disorders involving basement membrane components. Basement membrane degradation and turnover are of interest to scientists investigating dynamic processes such as angiogenesis, cancer metastasis, embryo implantation, and mammary gland involution. There has also been substantial interest from the biotechnology industry regarding the roles of basement membranes in wound healing, angiogenesis, nerve regeneration, inflammation, and tissue repair. The 2008 Conference will present a diverse mixture of sessions on the basic science of basement membrane structure, biosynthesis, assembly, turnover, and functions. Comparative studies of basement membrane function in vertebrates and invertebrates and the roles of basement membranes and extracellular matrix and their receptors in embryonic development will be addressed. Studies on the genetic analyses of basement membrane functions and the generation of animal models of human basement membrane disorders will be presented. PROPOSAL NARRATIVE Basement membranes are complex, three-dimensional, extracellular structures that play crucial roles in the organization and function of most tissues and organs, including muscle, skin, blood vessels, brain, heart, lung, kidney, and nerves.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone marrow derived stem cells are a non-controversial, attractive source of adult stem cells that can advance the study of stem cell biology, stem cell based therapies, and regenerative medicine. Approximately 60,000 patients are treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) per year worldwide. Since the early 1970's, BMT has been a treatment cornerstone for a variety of diseases and disorders. Historically, BMT has primarily been utilized in the treatment of malignancies. Now, there is increasing research and use of BMT in the treatment of non-malignant genetic and autoimmune diseases. Because bone marrow contains mesenchymal stem cells, in addition to hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors, and other cell populations that may prove important to tissue regeneration, additional uses of bone marrow derived stem cells are rapidly evolving for the repair of a wide variety of tissues. As stem cell biology matures, it is anticipated that marrow derived stem cells will play a role in the treatment of a diverse array of disorders, including cardiovascular disease and those of the liver, kidney, and pancreas. Acquiring bone marrow stem cells however is, traumatic, difficult, time consuming, and expensive when utilizing current invasive operative techniques, which have gone essentially unchanged for over 40 years. To obtain 1 or more liters of marrow for BMT, about 100 to 300 separate trocar entries and small-volume aspirations are taken from the donor's posterior ileac crest. The operation is performed under general anesthesia, and requires two transplant physicians, a full operating room team, and costs over $15k/harvest. Consequently, hematopoetic stem cells are increasingly being obtained from mobilized peripheral blood; despite, (1) an increased incidence of life threatening graft versus host disease (GVHD) in the allogeneic transplants, and (2) unknown long term risks to the donor from prolonged (at least 5 days of injections) dosage with granulocyte colony stimulation factor, which is needed in order to stimulate bone marrow stem cell production. Because of drug costs and the length of aphaeresis sessions needed in order to obtain an adequate number of CD34+ cells, each donor collection costs about $15k. From a clinical perspective, mobilized PBSC stem and progenitor cells populations are not as diverse as cells obtained from marrow, and contain a higher fraction of T-cells, contributing to increased GVHD. Given the current and future therapeutic uses for adult, marrow derived cells, improved methods for harvesting bone marrow are needed. StemCor Systems is developing a minimally invasive bone marrow harvesting device that is designed to rapidly harvest significant volumes of bone marrow through a single entry into the iliac bone within an outpatient setting under local anesthesia. Proof-of-concept development has been completed utilizing basic and large scale prototypes. In Phase 1, advanced, integrated prototypes will be designed, fabricated and tested on bench top models and in live animal models to demonstrate bone marrow harvesting feasibility. Relevance: By making access to adult stem cells faster, less expensive, and more convenient, the minimally invasive bone marrow harvesting device being developed by StemCor Systems will enable improved clinical care and outcomes for bone marrow transplant patients and their marrow donors, facilitate advances in stem cell biology, and support advances in regenerative therapies, which utilize stem cells harvested from the patient to repair the patient's own damaged tissue. This device will facilitate bone marrow stem cell derived treatments for a wide variety of diseases and disorders, including cancer, genetic disorders, and autoimmune diseases.

outcomes. The spectrum of intra-tumoral histological heterogeneity in adenocarcinoma suggests
nvasiveness represents a continuum of disease from noninvasive bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAG) to
adenocarcinoma mixed subtype with BAG component to pure invasive adenocarcinoma. The molecular
events essential to this transition in the lung are presently unknown. In this study, we focus on invasion, a
significant biological and morphological characteristic of cancer with direct clinical implications in terms of
metastasis and outcome. In preliminary gene expression profiling experiments, we identified the type II TGF-
/? receptor (TGF/SRII), which was expressed at significantly lower levels in invasive tumors, as one of the
most interesting genes in the acquisition of lung invasiveness classifiers. We hypothesize that repression of
TGFBRII in lung adenocarcinoma is required to mediate tumor/stromal interactions that precede the
acquisition of invasiveness in lung adenocarcinoma. In this grant proposal, we will address the main
hypothesis in the following Specific aims: 1. Determine the direct role of Tgfbr2 repression on
adenocarcinoma invasiveness in vivo using genetic model of murine lung adenocarcinoma. We will create a
novel animal model of invasive lung adenocarcinoma in mice with pulmonary targeted deletion of Tgfbr2 and
mutation of K-Ras. In Aim 2, we will determine the requirement for CCL5 (Rantes) in mediating tumor-
stromal interactions that are important for invasion of TGFBRII knock-down cells. CCL5 was identified as a
potential downstream mediator of TGFB signaling in invasive tumors. In Aim 3, we will create a large
adenocarcinoma tumor microarray to examine the clinical significance of TGFBRII immunostaining human
lung adenocarcinoma. In these studies, we will demonstrate the importance of TGFBR2 pathways in
modulating tumor epithelial/stromal interactions important for the acquisition of invasiveness in lung
adenocarcinoma and we expect to identify the mechanisms of this activity. The results of these studies will
facilitate the attainment of the long-term goals, which are to develop clinically available assays to predict
invasive propensity in adenocarcinoma tissue specimens and to develop and test pharmacologic agents that
will reduce invasiveness in patients with lung cancer or prevent the development of invasive tumors in
individuals at high risk for lung cancer.","410977",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, renin expressing cells of the renal afferent arterioles, have been described as modified vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In response to prolonged stimulation, the number of renin producing cells in the JG afferent arterioles increases significantly. This phenomenon, known as JG cell hyperplasia, is thought to involve phenotypic change of afferent arteriole VSMC to become renin producing cells. However, recent studies have demonstrated that renin progenitor cells (RPC) can be detected in the mesenchyme of the prevascular metanephric kidney. These RPC are incorporated into the afferent arterioles of the embryonic kidney, become JG renin producing cells and acquire smooth muscle markers. Our recent data support these findings and demonstrate that adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be induced into renin synthesizing JG-like cells in vitro. Furthermore, MSC-like cells (characterized by CD44 and c-kit immunoreactivity) can be isolated from the adult kidney and can differentiate to express renin. Moreover, we have observed that JG cells undergoing hyperplasia in vivo (in response to low sodium diet and captopril) exhibit co-staining for renin, BrdU, CD44+ and c-kit+. Taken together, these data have led us to hypothesize that: 1) MSCs are precursors of JG renin producing cells, 2) MSC-like cells exist in the adult kidney in vivo and undergo proliferation and differentiation under intense stimulation and contribute to JG cell hyperplasia, and 3) these cells in the adult kidney may either be resident RPC or originate extrarenally. To examine these hypotheses, four specific aims will be undertaken: 1) we will first confirm that renin cells derived from MSCs in culture possess authentic JG cell characteristics; 2) we will inject MSCs into mouse blastocysts and follow their fate in the kidney as they become renin expressing cells of the afferent arteriole during development and in the pathobiology of JG hyperplasia in the adult animal; 3) we will further demonstrate that RPC with MSC characteristics exist in the kidney and that these cells can become JG renin cells and participate in JG hyperplasia; and 4) we will determine the source of these RPC in the adult kidney i.e. resident intrarenally vs. originating extrarenally such as the bone marrow. These experiments should lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms of JG hyperplasia and the regulation of renin expression.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for new stem cell engineering toolsets that can regulate adult stem cell expansion (self-renewal, without differentiation) ex vivo in order to create sufficient numbers of cells for clinical applications. The goals of this proposal are to: 1) develop a computer vision system that tracks in real-time the spatiotemporal histories of cell divisions in vitro in phase-contrast imagery; 2) use this data to automatically derive real-time metrics of symmetry, division times, confluence, and predictive population growth models; and, 3) apply this system to develop novel strategies that maximize the yield of adult stem cell expansion in growth factor-mediated conditions. 'Real-time' means that processing is completed 'on-line' in the 15 minute intervals between image acquisitions, and this information is available during cell culture as feedback for process monitoring and control. In Aim 1, robust image segmentation and tracking of dense cell populations will be achieved using multi-modal cell tracking modules that represent and reason about cell states and motion from different perspectives, and then fuse and coordinate their respective outputs to make collaborative decisions. The multi-modal modules will be formulated for fast implementation on vector-based graphics processing hardware. The system will measure: proliferation, lineage (i.e., parent-daughter relationship), quiescence, and apoptotic states of each cell in culture within developing confluent populations of muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs), including immortalized pluripotent C2C12, primary mouse MDSCs, and primary human MDSCs. In Aim 2, the system will be applied to efficient discovery and characterization of cell expansion behaviors and determination of nominal culture conditions to maximize symmetry using bio-printed combinatorial arrays of immobilized growth factors on extracellular matrix substrates. In Aim 3, real-time monitoring and control of cell expansion will be demonstrated using an adaptive subculturing strategy; the predictive growth model will signal when to suspend cell culture, followed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting to exclude apoptotic or differentiating cells, thus selectively enriching subcultures for cells exhibiting the highest proliferation rates.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Malignant gliomas are among the most devastating tumors, with survival only one to three years after diagnosis even with the best of treatments. Surgery and radiation therapy (followed by adjuvant chemotherapy), which form the standard practice, very often fail because of uncertainty in delineating the margin of the tumor. Moreover due to infiltrative nature of glioblastomamulteforme (GBM), it is not possible to resect 100% of tumor mass during surgery. Gene therapy promises to improve the prognosis of GBM, however, several factors including the lack of an efficient vector limit the ability of gene therapy to produce the desired success. Moreover, the vehicles for successful delivery of desired gene at desired site is still lacking. In recent years, different stem cells have been successfully employed to carry a gene to target tumor sites. The combination of gene transfer techniques with cellular transplantation is an elegant and promising approach to the delivery of therapeutic molecules to normal or neoplastic cells in the CNS. We have reported the ability of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), a class of hematopoietic stem cells, to migrate and incorporate into the angiogenesis of implanted glioma. EPCs have migrated actively at the periphery of the tumors when administered intravenously or locally and incorporated into angiogenesis. Detection of migration and incorporation was possible due to magnetic labeling of EPCs. These EPCs can be used as carrier as well as delivery vehicles for gene into tumors. Moreover, by magnetic labeling (using FDA approved ferumoxides and protamine sulfate); these cells can be used as cellular probes for MRI to track the movement of the cells after administration. Accessibility, easy harvesting and established techniques for genetic manipulation renders EPCs as attractive cellular vehicles when systemic gene carrier is required. In this proposed research, we aim to investigate the ability of EPCs to carry a gene to the tumor sites and use these transgenic cells as cellular probes to track the migration and incorporation in the tumors by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The goals of this research will be achieved by making glioma model in nude rats and magnetically labeled or unlabeled transgenic (carrying human sodium iodide symporter, hNIS) EPCs will be administered either systemically or locally, and the migration, homing and incorporation of these cells into tumor neovasculatures will be detected by MRI and nuclear medicine imaging technique (SPECT). If these cells carry and express hNIS at tumor sites (which will be detected by SPECT), it will open a new area of investigation with clinical applicability, where EPCs can be used as gene carrier or delivery vehicles. The long-term goal of this proposal is to extend the findings into clinical use by collecting stem cells from patients' peripheral blood and manipulate them as gene delivery vehicles for both systemic and local administrations, which can also be used as imaging probes for MRI.The results of this proposed project will advance the methods of diagnosis and treatment in two ways. Magnetically labeled cells will help detect the tumors using in vivo MRI by targeting active site of angiogenesis and this may help clinician to plan anti-angiogenic treatment strategy. If we are able to efficiently transfect and track the homing of these transgenic cells at the site of glioma, it will open a new way of delivering gene (for different factors) to the site of tumors using EPCs. Mixing magnetically labeled cells (for example 10% of total administered cells) with transgenic cells, MRI can also be used to confirm the migration and homing of transgenic cells at the sites of interest. Moreover, magnetically labeled transgenic cells can be delivered to a site of interest by applying external magnetic field during intra-arterial infusion.

By defining common changes in the gene expression profile (GEP) of tumor cells and the microenvironment (ME), critical pathways involved in disease evolution may be identified. Project 3 will define molecular signatures of disease initiation, evolution, and resistance/relapse by studying the GEP of ME and MM and by examining molecular consequences of MM-ME interactions. Because the stromal cells of the bone ME may be transiently or permanently modified in MM and contribute to tumorigenesis, we will test the hypothesis that GEP of the ME component of the MM bone marrow will enable us to identify key molecular mechanisms through which the ME contributes to the disease phenotype. Two aims will rely on samples obtained through clinical research performed in Projects 1 and 2. Aim 1: Identify and validate candidate
genes involved in pathogenetic crosstalk between the MM and ME that contribute to the MM phenotype. This will be accomplished by (a) identifying ME-associated GEP changes that are linked to tumor development and plasma cell dyscrasia, (b) correlating ME-associated genes (MAGs) with MM PC GEP-defined or disease characteristic-defined subgroups to identify potential tumor cell-ME crosstalk mechanisms, and (c) identifying common drug-specific qualitative or quantitative changes in the MM PC and ME GEP after short-term (48-hour) drug treatment. Aim 2: Develop and validate GEP as a prognostic indicator of clinical outcome to form a rational basis for selecting treatment in the future. Patient outcomes (complete response, event-free and overall survival) will be correlated with GEP of the MM and ME. Specifically, through Aim 2 we will (a) determine whether the GEP changes found in Aim 1c after short-term
(48-hour) drug treatment correlate with clinical outcome; (b) assess whether baseline GEP signatures of ME, MM PCs, or both predict outcome; and (c) compare GEP of ME and MM PCs at baseline, remission, and relapse to identify molecular determinants of resistance and pathways associated with disease progression. The bone marrow ME is a complex heterogenous mixture of cells with each having a distinct GEP. However, with the large sample groups available through the P01, recurring patterns found in MM combined with validation studies will provide insight into the key molecular signals contributing to disease progression originate. Elucidating the key GEP signatures in MM disease evolution will provide clinically relevant information that can be used to develop targeted therapies and ultimately improve treatment."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to assess in a relevant animal model the safety, feasibility and efficacy of adult stem cell administration to the CNS for treating neurological sequelae associated with lysosomal storage diseases. Specifically, adult stem cells derived from bone marrow, referred to as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be injected unilaterally into the caudate putamen of infant rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) using stereotaxic coordinates determined by MRI. Prior to and at various periods up to 1 year post-transplantation, the health, development, behavior as well as cognitive and motor skills of each transplant recipient will be evaluated using a battery of age appropriate tests and compared to sham-operated animals or normative control data. Additionally, the levels and anatomical distribution of male MSCs engrafted in the CNS of female transplant recipients will be evaluated using a real-time PCR assay we developed that targets sequences in the Macaca sp. Y chromosome. To confirm the real-time PCR data engrafted MSCs will be visualized in brain sections by immunofluorescent staining or FISH and counted using modern stereological techniques. Correlating MSC engraftment in brain with long-term affects on health, development, behavior and motor function will directly assess the safety and feasibility of intracranial MSC administration. Subsequently, MSCs will be injected into the CNS of infant macaques afflicted with globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe's Disease). The latter is characterized by a lack of galactocerebrosidase (GALC) activity, which results in abnormal accumulation of storage material in oligodendrocytes causing progressive demyelination in the nervous system. In these studies MSC engraftment levels and distribution will be directly correlated with levels of expressed GALC mRNA and enzyme activity throughout the CNS. Furthermore, affects on disease progression will be evaluated using biochemical and histological methods as well as behavioral and motor performance tests. Consequently, this phase of the study will directly evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of MSC administration. Collectively, these proposed studies will yield important pre-clinical data in a relevant animal model that will be essential for developing stem cell-based therapies to treat neurological sequelae in human infants and children afflicted with various lysosomal storage diseases.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I STTR proposal has been substantially revised in response to the Study Section review. The proposal was written in response to the NIH Director's newly released }roadmap} that encourages collaboration between corporate and academic institutions to develop alternative models for conducting research and the suggestion by Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, that }academic pursuit of [the] first step in drug development could be particularly valuable}. This STTR Phase I proposal combines the talents of Zen-Bio, Inc., the leading commercial supplier of human adipose tissue-derived cells for pharmaceutical research, with those of an NIH-funded Botanical Research Center at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, an internationally recognized center for studies of diabetes and nutrition, and Rutgers University, an internationally recognized center for the development of botanical extracts. Our overarching hypothesis is that botanicals may effect one or more tissue types in the development of metabolic syndrome and extracts that limit the amount of fatty acid }release} in adipose tissue (lipolysis or TG accumulation) will reduce the amount of ectopic peripheral fat accumulation and cardiovascular risk (e.g. niacin). In the Phase I proposal, we hypothesize that high-throughput screening assays using human adipose cell models will: (1) Identify novel lead compounds from an existing botanical library and; (2) Complement existing assays in the fractionation of extracts from botanicals with known benefits for obese, diabetic, or hypertensive patients. As the commercial partner, Zen-Bio brings an existing portfolio of high-throughput human cell-based assays for lipogenesis, lipolysis, and adipogenic gene expression profiling. As the academic partner, the Botanical Center at PBRC in collaboration with Rutgers University provides its unique library of botanical extracts and chemical fractionation expertise. In addition, the Botanical Center has already subfractionated botanical extracts from plants with identified therapeutic effects for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. All of these tools and reagents will be available for the proposed studies. Prior studies validate the utility and efficacy of this approach. The murine 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cell line has been used to screen a combinatorial chemical library for lead compounds promoting or inhibiting adipogenesis (2); however, it is well known that compounds identified in murine models often fail as human pharmacological agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The chemicals identified through this STTR may have potential application in the treatment of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. The outcome of this work will have direct commercial implications for both Zen-Bio and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in terms of potential products, licensing opportunities, and intellectual property.

Deregulations of this tightly regulated process can cause human birth defects and neoplastic transformation.  Pbx1 is a homeodomain protein that collaboratively binds DNA with Hox proteins to modulate their DNA binding specificities and is a homolog of Drosophila extradenticle (EXD), whose function in patterning the fly body plan has been demonstrated genetically.  Our ongoing efforts and long-term goals utilize genetically modified mouse models to assess the contributions of the Pbx family of Hox cofactors to mammalian patterning and morphogenesis.  In embryos, the lack of Pbx1 (Pbx1-l-) results in late gestational lethality, widespread patterning defects of the axial and appendicular skeleton, homeotic transformation of second branchial arch neural crest cell-derived skeletal structures, markedly diminished chondrocyte proliferation, accompanied by precocious chondrocyte hypertrophy, and premature ossification of bone.  Unlike Pbx1-l-, both Pbx2 -l-and Pbx3-l- mice do not display gross abnormalities either in patterning or in skeletal development/maturation. Nonetheless, Pbx1-l-; Pbx2-l- mutants die earlier in utero and show drastic exacerbation of the skeletal defects.  The goal of this proposal is to finely dissect the genetic control of patterning and skeletal development by the homeobox gene Pbx1, through the following specific aims: 1) genetically uncouple the early roles of Pbxl in patterning from its later roles in cartilage proliferation, differentiation and endochondral ossification, through the generation of knockout mice where Pbxl is inactivated in a tissue-specific manner in neural crest and chondrocytes, by utilizing available Cre mice; 2) characterize the role of Pbx1 in chondrocyte proliferation by using genetically modified (Pbx1-l-) mesenchymal cells in culture, such as Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs), which show a striking growth defect, and Micromass Mesenchyme Cultures; 3) identify unique and overlapping functions of Pbx1 with the related family member Pbx2 in skeletal development and also exclusively in the genetic control of chondrogenesis.  Completion of these studies will advance our understanding of the genetic regulation of patterning and skeletal development by Pbx1.  Under a broader perspective, this work will shed light on the dramatic effects of the perturbations of skeletal development and hopefully impact on our understanding of the pathogenesis of human birth defects that affect the development of the craniofacial, axial and appendicular skeleton.","316121",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: The applicant will begin as an Assistant Professor in the Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center starting July 2003. Dr. Elluru has trained extensively, has a steadfast commitment to academic pediatric otolaryngology, and strives to excel as a physician and a scientist. To continue his training as a clinician-scientist he would like to pursue basic science research training in a mentored environment, with the goal of developing into an independent investigator. Environment: The research outlined in this application will be sponsored by Dr. Jeffrey A. Whitsett, Professor of Pediatrics and Director of the Division of Pulmonary Biology. Dr. Whitsett is a recognized leader in the field of lung physiology, developmental biology, and molecular genetics. Dr. Whitsett and Dr. Elluru have an outstanding and productive working relationship, which will be a tremendous asset in Dr. Elluru's development as a clinician-scientist. Cincinnati Children's Hospital and the Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology are strongly committed to supporting Dr. Elluru's training as a clinician-scientist and the development of a research program addressing congenital anomalies of the upper respiratory tract. The environment at the medical center is richly collegiate, and contains vast intellectual as well as material resources to nurture academic development. Research: Congenital anomalies of the upper respiratory tract, usually arising as a result of malformed cartilaginous support structures, result in significant childhood morbidity and mortality. Dr. Elluru will characterize the molecular mechanisms patterning the development of upper respiratory tract cartilage, with the long-term goal of 1) identifying the genetic and molecular basis of congenital upper respiratory tract lesions and 2) developing more efficacious treatment paradigms. The central hypothesis that will be tested in this grant application is that endodermal-mesodermal interactions, mediated by Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and Fibroblast Growth Factor 18 (FGF-18), regulate the morphogenesis of cartilaginous support structures of the upper respiratory tract.

mechanisms that regulate angiogenesis, tumor growth and progression. We have recently reported the
presence of ADAMT2 (A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase 12),in the urine of women with breast cancer and
have further demonstrated that its presence predicts both clinical status and stage in these women. In this
same study, we reported, for the first time, that ADAM12 can degrade extracellular matrix components
including type IV collagen and fibronectin and that it has gelatinase activity as well. These data have led us
to hypothesize that ADAM12 may play a role in tumor angiogenesis and progression by remodeling the
extracellular matrix and/or through a variety of other mechanisms that have been attributed to this family of
enzymes, including ectodomain shedding, regulation of growth factor availability and mediating cell-cell and
cell-matrix interactions. We have also recently demonstrated that ADAM12 levels are significantly
upregulated during one of the earliest checkpoints during tumor progression, the angiogenic switch and that
its overexpression in human breast cancer cells results in a significant increase in the production of VEGF.
ADAM12 overexpression also resulted in a significant increase in human breast cancer cell motility and
invasivity, an upregulation of the classic mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin and the acquisition
of a scattering phenotype, all of which are consistent with the induction of EMI (Epithelial to Mesenchymal
Transformation), a hallmark of cancer progression. ADAM12 also conferred estrogen-independent(ER)
growth status to ER positive breast cancer cells. Finally, in a series of preliminary studies, we found that
ADAM12 overexpression promoted prthotopic human breast cancer growth in vivo. Within the context of the
Specific Aims of our proposal, we will determine the mechanism(s) by which ADAM12 may be regulating
angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. These mechanistic studies will be complimented by a series of
in vivo ones in which we will determine the effects of ADAM12 on human breast tumor growth and
progression using three complimentary in vivo models. These studies will also be informative as to the
potential role of ADAM12 as a therapeutic target in the treatment of breast cancer and its progression. In the
third Aim of this study, we will determine whether urinary ADAM12, alone or in combination with other cancer
biomarkers, may be a diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarker for breast cancer and its progression. These
studies are proposed within the context of the following Specific Aims:
 1. To determine the mechanism(s) by which ADAM12 may regulate angiogenesis, tumor growth and
 metastasis
 2. To determine whether ADAM12 promotes human breast cancer growth and progression in vivo
 3. To determine whether the presence of ADAM12, alone or multiplexed with other urinary cancer
 biomarkers, predicts tumor presence, progression, and therapeutic efficacy in animal models of
 breast cancer and in human patients with oreast cancer.
By systematically identifying novel molecules that may be playing a role in the development and progression
of breast cancer, and by dissecting the mechanisms by which such molecules may be exerting their effects,
we will have the opportunity to develop new and improved therapeutic, diagnostic and prognostic strategies
that could result in significantly improved cancer patient survival."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The functional importance of the Cspg2/versican gene to early heart formation has been clearly demonstrated by the Cspg2 null mice called heart defect (hdf). Total absence of the Cspg2 gene literally means the end of heart development at a stage prior to cushion formation and outlet segment growth. This creates a problem for determining the functional mechanism and significance of Cspg2/versican at later stages of heart development involving septa and valve maturation when there is the highest relevance to the cardiac defects most often seen in live births. To approach these questions, we have begun to analyze to a new mouse model that is a mRNA splice form null of Cspg2. Our analysis shows that mice homozygous for the deletion can survive and breed, but also possess cardiac defects highly relevant to at least 1/3 of all live birth defects. Our central working hypothesis is that Cspg2/versican modulates normal EGFR signaling in the heart cushions and regulates cell-matrix signaling needed for growth and muscularization of the forming heart cushions. The major questions to be addressed are 1) how does versican play a role in modulating EGF signaling and downstream targets needed during cushion mesenchyme formation, growth and maturation; ii) what is the active or permissive role of versican in the two fundamental steps of outlet cushion myocardialization; iii) what is the role of versican in stabilizing the myocardial phenotype in maturing cushion mesenchyme? The purpose of the proposed studies are to determine versican's function at later stages that impact directly on live birth heart defects. We will use a combination of in vitro bioassays, morphology, high throughput 3D confocal imaging and high throughput proteomics to determine versican's function. The Specific Aims are: 1) Determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which versican splice forms modulate formation and differentiation of the cushion mesenchyme.; 2) Determine the mechanism through which the versican V2/V0 splice form mediates the process of myocardialization that is associated with alignment of the cardiac outlet septa to the ventricular outlets.; 3) Determine how the defective phenotype in the V2/V0 null hearts is modulated when placed on genetic backgrounds affecting EGFR signaling and heart development. Several morphogenetic mechanisms involving cushion mesenchyme have been reported to be necessary for remodeling the U-shaped heart tube into four chambers. However, the active or permissive role of the Cspg2 gene product, versican, on these central mechanisms is recognized but largely unexplored. The V2/V0 null mouse provides the first mammalian model in which we can directly investigate the disruption of these central mechanisms of cardiac outlet integration that result from a partial absence of the extracellular matrix proteoglycan versican.Although several morphogenetic mechanisms involving cushion mesenchyme have been reported to be necessary for remodeling the U-shaped heart tube into four chambers, the active or permissive role of the Cspg2 gene product, versican, is recognized but largely unexplored. We have shown in the heart defect mouse (Cspg2 null), the failure to form cushions results in early embryonic lethality. The V2/V0 null mouse in this proposal provides the first mammalian model in which we can directly investigate the role of versican in the heart at developmental stages that directly impact clinically relevant live birth heart defects.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tremendous unmet clinical needs exist in musculoskeletal medicine. Novel strategies are required to safely promote bone formation in low turnover osteoporosis, osteoporosis in children with open epiphyses, avulsion injuries at sites of bone-tendon insertion, and fracture repair in the setting of underlying malignancy or vascular compromise. A fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanism governing osteoblast differentiation is essential for developing novel therapeutics to address these unmet needs. Notch signaling has emerged as an evolutionarily conserved cell-cell communication mechanism that controls cell fate in multicellular organisms. In the best-studied paradigms, upon ligand-induced cleavage by ?-secretase, Notch receptors activate a transcription factor known as RBP-J? in mammals, which in turn up-regulates expression of transcription repressors of the Hes/Hey family. It is the Hes/Hey family members that directly regulate the expression and/or function of cell-lineage specific transcription factors. Recently, by removing Notch receptors (Notch1 and 2) or core components of ?-secretase (presenilin 1 and 2) in early limb mesenchyme, we discovered a physiological role for Notch signaling in osteoblast differentiation from progenitor cells. Specifically, loss of Notch signaling expands osteoblast numbers and augments trabecular bone mass in the appendicular skeleton. Importantly, specific members of the Hes/Hey family are reduced in Notch-deficient osteoblastic cells. Moreover, we found that Hes/Hey proteins physically associated with Runx2 and inhibited its activity. Thus, we hypothesize that 1) Notch acts through RBP-J? to regulate Hes/Hey levels in osteoblast progenitors, and that 2) Hes/Hey proteins regulate osteoblast differentiation by modulating Runx2 activity. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue three specific aims to examine the potential bone phenotype in tissue-specific RBP-J? knockout animals, and Hes/Hey mutant animals. We will also examine the role of the key molecules in osteoblast differentiation in vitro. Finally, we will begin to test the potential of inhibiting Notch signaling as a novel bone anabolic strategy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tremendous unmet clinical needs exist in musculoskeletal medicine. Novel strategies are required to safely promote bone formation in low turnover osteoporosis, tearing injuries at sites of bone-tendon insertion, and bone fracture repair. This proposal is designed to understand the mechanism responsible for controlling the number of bone cells in postnatal life. Research results from this study will provide a molecular framework for developing novel bone-enhancing pharmaceutics.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Infiltrating carcinomas characteristically elicit a reactive stroma response, and accumulating evidence indicates that tumor stroma fibroblasts reciprocally promote tumor development and growth.  The cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, syndecan-1 (Sdc1) is thought to function as a coreceptor for growth factor and extracellular matrix interactions, and Sdc1 expression is induced in reactive stromal cells of breast carcinomas in both mice and man.  Mice with a targeted mutation in Sdc1 show reduced tumor development in response to oncogene expression, and altered responses to other pathological stimuli that are associated with the induction of stromal Sdc1.  Our preliminary data further demonstrate a growth-promoting loop between breast cancer cells and their stroma that depends upon the activity of Sdc1.  Hypothesis: Sdc1 is a key molecule mediating epithelial-stromal interactions in breast carcinoma.  Expression of Sdc1 by mesenchymal stromal cells promotes tumor growth by providing a mitogenic cue to epithelial carcinoma cells.  This hypothesis will be tested by addressing the following specific aims.  Aim 1: Determine the Sdc1 core protein requirements for stromal fibroblast-mediated carcinoma growth stimulation: The respective contribution of distinct Sdc1 core protein domains will be evaluated with a panel of deletion mutants.  Sdc1-mediated stroma effects will be assessed using a physiologically relevant three-dimensional co-culture system.  Aim 2: Characterize the molecular mechanism by which Sdc1-expressing stromal fibroblasts promote carcinoma cell growth: This aim will examine potential mechanisms of carcinoma growth stimulation by Sdc1-expressing stromal fibroblasts.  Specifically, we will investigate the role of matrix metalloproteases and heparan sulfate-dependent paracrine growth factors.  The possibility that stromal Sdc1 modulates extracellular matrix assembly will also be investigated.  Aim 3: Determine the role of stromal Sdc1 induction in breast carcinoma tumorigenesis in vivo: Stromal Sdc1 expression will be examined in human breast carcinoma samples and the contribution of stromal cell Sdc1 to carcinoma growth will be systematically evaluated in rodent models.  A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved will help in developing therapeutic approaches designed to disrupt detrimental epithelial-stromal signaling.

 Pulmonary fibrosis may result from dysregulated wound healing responses to sequential lung injuries.
Recruitment of circulating bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal precursors (fibrocytes) is crucial for a
fibroproliferative host response post-injury. Fibrocytes contribute to extracellular matrix (ECM) generation and
promote fibrosis through the secretion of profibrotic/proinflammatory factors. A focal alveolar epithelial cell
(AEC) injury is believed to be the initiating event of the fibrotic process. The etiologic agents of lung injury are
unknown but latent viral infections, especially by members of the herpesvirinae have been associated with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Viral infection might influence fibroproliferative responses via lysis of
parenchymal lung cells or by inducing alterations in the function(s) of resident or recruited cells. Infection of
mice with MHV-68 (a murine gammaherpesvirus) results in both lytic and latent infection of AECs and mimics
human infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Our preliminary data demonstrate 1) MHV-68 infection
augments fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-induced lung fibrosis when given both prior to or after the fibrotic
insult. 2) Fibrocytes are recruited to the lung in response to MHV-68 infection. 3) MHV-68 infection results in
the generation of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cys LTs) which can induce migration and activation of fibrocytes.
4) MHV-68 can infect fibrocytes and enhance their proliferation. 5) The additional alveolar injury induced by
FITC, induces a dysregulated cytokine and eicosanoid response which favors fibrocyte proliferation,
differentiation and ECM deposition. We hypothesize that increased fibrosis following MHV-68
infection/FITC injury is the result of enhanced recruitment, proliferation and differentiation of
fibrocytes. Recruitment and proliferation are increased due to releases of cys LTs and CC chemokines
by resident cells of the lung. Differentiation is enhanced by production of altered ratios of fibrocyte
stimulatory and protective molecules by parenchymal and recruited cells. Completion of the following
specific aims will provide new information regarding mechanisms that lead to generation of or exacerbation of
pulmonary fibrosis. Aim 1) To determine the kinetics and role of alveolar MHV-68 infection in augmentation of
FITC-induced pulmonary fibrosis; Aim 2) To determine whether MHV-68 infection alters the secretion of pro-
or anti-fibrotic mediators by AECs, alveolar macrophages (AMs), interstitial macrophages (IMs) and B cells and
to perform correlative studies in human AMs infected with EBV; Aim 3) To determine whether MHV-68
infection recruits more fibrocytes to the lung, whether MHV-68 or EBV infection alters fibrocytes and fibroblasts
and to determine the role of cys LTs in MHV-68-induced recruitment of fibrocytes and augmentation of fibrosis. Project Narrative/Relevance
The experiments proposed in this application will provide mechanistic insight into the role that viral infections
may play in predisposing people to the development of fibrosis. Research will also address the role that viral

In non-stressed normal
cells, the p53 protein is practically latent, owing to its being present in very low amounts and in a rather
inactive molecular form. The relative lack of activity of p53 under such conditions is largely due to the action
of Mdm2, which targets p53 for rapid degradation and, furthermore, maintains p53 in a complex that is
incompatible with efficient performance of p53 as a transcription factor. In response to a variety of stress
signals, particularly those that are closely linked with cancer (e.g. genomic damage, oncogene activation),
p53 is freed of the inhibitory effects of Mdm2. This results in stabilization and activation of p53, leading to a
multitude of biochemical and biological effects. The consequence of such p53 activation, when occurring in
an incipient cancer cell, is the elimination of such cell from the replicative pool, preventing its further
progression into a life-threatening tumor. The long term objective of this project is to elucidate the
mechanisms responsible for maintaining p53 inactive in non-stressed cells, the biochemical events that
enable p53 activation in response to cancer-related stress, and the molecular basis for the failure of p53 to
function properly in human cancer cells, even when retained in its wild type form. Specifically, this work will
address the impact of covalent modifications on Mdm2, particularly acetylation, evaluate the exact nature of
the changes that are imposed on p53 as a consequence of Mdm2 activity, investigate the idea that some of
the inhibitory effects of Mdm2 may involve its interaction with the chromatin of p53 target genes in a manner
leading to transcriptional silencing, explore the possibility that dominant negative forms of p63, a p53 family
member, are responsible for the failure of p53 to function as an effective tumor suppressor in some human
cancers, and elucidate the regulation of p53 activation by cell-cell interaction and its relevance for the
conversion of epithelial tumors to a more malignant state. The methodology will include a combination of
cell-free assays for protein activity, mutational analysis and genetic manipulation of cultured cells, analysis of
protein-protein interactions, gene expression analysis, and in vivo experiments in normal and cancer-bearing
mice. Success of the proposed experiments should allow a better understanding of the regulation of p53
activity and its subversion in cancer, and provide clues for improved cancer therapy.","215047",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is an extremely common degenerative disease resulting from an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption. This discrepancy worsens with age, such that approximately 50% of women over the age of 50 will experience an osteoporotic fracture. The molecular mechanisms guiding the differentiation of bone forming cells, or osteoblasts, are not clearly understood. Gsa is a ubiquitously expressed G protein subunit that mediates signaling cascades downstream of a variety of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Several GPCRs have been implicated in skeletal development, and in particular the parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTH-related peptide receptor (PPR) has a critical function in osteoblast development. We have hypothesized that Gsa likely has essential functions at multiple stages of bone development and that ablation of Gsa early in the osteoblastic lineage will have profound effects on osteoblast differentiation. We have conditionally deleted Gsa in early osteoblast precursors by mating Gsafloxed mice with transgenic mice carrying the Cre recombinase driven by the promoter of osterix, a transcription factor expressed early in osteoblastogenesis. Mice with deletion of Gsa signaling early in osteoblast differentiation have marked skeletal fragility as demonstrated by numerous postnatal fractures and severely reduced trabecular and cortical bone. Furthermore expression of osteocalcin, a marker of terminally differentiated osteoblasts, is almost absent. TRAP staining for osteoclasts does not reveal dramatic increase in bone resorption, making a failure of bone formation the more likely etiology for reduced bone mass in these mutant mice. The focus of this grant proposal will be on the impact of Gsa deficiency on osteoblast differentiation. The expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) regulated by osterix in these genetically altered mice further provides the opportunity to determine how and whether commonly used in vitro assays for osteoblast differentiation correspond to actual events in vivo. Aim I seeks to determine how Gsa regulates osteoblast differentiation; this will be assessed in vivo using in situ hybridization, and in vitro by culturing bone marrow stromal cells from wild-type and BGsaKO mice under osteogenic conditions. Furthermore, flow cytbmetry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) will be applied to isolate cells of the osteoblast lineage in order to determine the mechanisms used by Gsa to direct osteoblast differentiation. Bone formation is dramatically stimulated by both PTH and canonical Wnt signaling pathways, and Aim 2 seeks to determine whether the loss of Gsa-mediated signaling results in inhibition of Wnt signaling as a mechanism underlying the profoundly reduced bone mass in BGsaKO mice. Finally, Aim 3 will focus on determining the ability of osteoprogenitors to differentiate towards other mesenchymal lineages such as adipocytes, using lineage tracing in vivo and cell differentiation assays in vitro.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
The Candidate's overall career goal is to establish and maintain an independent proteomic and molecular biology-based program focused on investigation of events that mediate diabetic nephropathy (DN). DN is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There are no current treatments that completely prevent progression to ESRD. This emphasizes the health-related importance for discovery of novel regulatory events as potential therapeutic targets for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of DN. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TF) is a prominent feature of progressive DN that is mediated by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). Notch4 is a fascinating membrane-bound transcription regulator that was recently implicated in TGF signaling and renal disease. Our preliminary findings indicate that Notch4 activation inhibits TGF-beta signaling in cultured renal tubular cells and show decreased expression of Notch4 in tubular cells from diabetic mice as compared with controls. This suggests a hypothesis that down-regulation of Notch4 activity promotes the TGF-beta-mediated effects in DN. This project will develop Notch4-deficient diabetic mice. Renal pathophysiology experiments will be performed to delineate the in vivo role of Notch4 in diabetes-mediated TF and TGF signaling. It is anticipated that these animals will also provide a better model for the study of TF, as none of the current diabetic animal models exactly mimic the TF observed in diabetic humans. Accumulating evidence suggests a key role of TGF-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in diabetes-associated TF. We have recently developed models for TGF-mediated EMT in human kidney (HK) tubule cell lines. We will also develop HK models for glucose and advanced glycation end product (AGE)-mediated EMT. We will use these cellular models in combination with active Notch4 transfection and RNAi-mediated Notch4 knockdown to dissect the role of Notch4 in different components of signaling and transcription activity in EMT. Lastly, we will use state-of-the-art proteomic techniques with the Notch4-deficient diabetic mice to define Notch4-mediated protein expression and organelle localization in DN. In addition to molecular insight provided by these studies, the animal model and pathophysiology training obtained during this Career Development Award will provide valuable resources for the Candidate to expand his diabetes-related program and obtain independent-level funding.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IFF) is characterized by fibroblast/myofibroblastic foci and excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) protein accumulation, in which fibroblast migration into the injured areas plays a critical role. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) mediates integrin- and growth factor-initiated cell migration. Overexpression of FAK's C-terminal homologous protein, FAK-related-non-kinase (FRNK), inhibits FAKdependent cell migration promoted by growth factors and integrin receptors in mesenchymal cells. However, the role of FRNK in lung fibroblast migration and its role in tissue injury/repair processes in vivo including lung fibrosis remain undefined. We hypothesize that FRNK modulates lung fibrosis in vivo through inhibition of FAK-dependent fibroblast cell migration. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the role of FRNK in inhibiting FAK-mediated lung fibroblast cell migration and migration signaling. Fibroblast migration will be tested in gain/loss of FRNK function approaches using patient-derived primary human lung fibroblast cells from pulmonary fibrotic patients and non-fibrotic controls. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the role of FRNK in lung fibrosis in vivo. The injury/repair response to the pro-fibrotic agent, Bleomycin, will be assessed in FRNK-knockout mice and congenic wild type mice. Furthermore, cell migration and migration signaling of primary lung fibroblasts isolated from these mice will be determined. The role of FRNK in the recruitment, and its resultant fibrotic effects, on bone-marrow derived cells and fibrocytes, and on epitheilal-mesenchymal transition, and on myofibroblast differentiation will be determined. In Specific Aim 3, we will determine the spatial-temporal relationship of FRNK expression with fibroproliferative lesions in Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, and characterize the in vivo mediators of FRNK expression in lung fibroblasts. These data will either support or refute our hypothesis that FRNK modulates fibroblast migration during lung injury and repair, and thereby affects the fibrotic processes in vivo. These studies will support the long-term goal of my laboratory to utilize knowledge gained from these studies to develop novel therapeutic approaches targeted to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in humans.

over $22 million in funding. Of these, 27 NCI grants account for $3.3 million. Program 3 researchers apply cellular, molecular biological, and genetic techniques to advance understanding of molecular pathogenesis. This new program evolved by integrating two original programs, the well-established Hormonal and Reproductive Cancers and The Gastrointestinal Malignancies Programs. The newly organized program incorporates research work reviewed
favorably in the previous competing renewal into a research network optimally supportive for translational research, an area of previous concern. Research in this new program involves studies of normal and malignant cells, as well as inherited diseases that predispose to the development of epithelial malignancies by combined mechanisms of genetic instability and microenvironmental perturbations. Translational studies along with Program 2, Hematologic,
have led us to discover, develop, and deliver new treatments for solid tumors, highlighted by molecular therapy of GISTs. Our members have defined new standards of care for total colonic surveillance in colorectal cancer, determined the role of stem cell transplant in poor-risk germ cell cancer, and improved prostate cancer therapy using high-dose calcitriol. We also have developed new murine conditional-knockout models of epithelial carcinogenesis,
discovered Herstatin (an inhibitor of EGF and Her2/neu signal transduction) and are clarifying an essential role of IGF signaling and Fanconi pathway dysfunction in clonal progression of epithelial malignancies of the prostate and ovary. The program provides a successful framework that promotes interactions between basic scientists involved in research on epithelial cell survival, differentiation, and clonal evolution and clinicians treating these disorders who

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Recent studies suggest that reparative cells which contribute to healing in the lung following injury also possess regenerative capacity. Although the biology of post-natal lung regeneration is not well understood, mechanical pre-stress appears to be an absolute requirement for tissue regeneration to occur. Emphysema, a disease characterized by tissue destruction, is a potential target for cell-based therapy. This disease is associated with: 1) loss of resident reparative cells; 2) loss of the extracellular matrix that transmits pre-stress signaling; 3) and loss of pre-stress itself, the very signal required to trigger regenerative responses. Although these factors represent obstacles to the development of regenerative therapeutic strategies for emphysema, preliminary studies in our lab show that modulation of mesenchymal and epithelial cell proliferation using members of the fibroblast growth factor family complexed to carrier molecules in a biocompatible polymer can promote expansion of parenchymal tissues. The polymer scaffold, an air containing foam with mechanical properties similar to healthy lung tissue, effectively transmits stress to reparative/progenitor cells to promote proliferation and remodeling. Studies proposed here will test the hypothesis that 1) therapeutic post-natal lung tissue growth in emphysema can be achieved by augmenting the lung's innate healing response using growth factors to direct endogenous reparative lung cells following a localized mild injury; and that 2) the magnitude of this response can be modulated by altering pre-stress using concomitant bronchoscopic lung volume reduction therapy to increase transpulmonary pressures. We intend to advance this approach, known as pneumografting, into human trials under a physician-sponsored Investigation New Drug Application.","21000",

In complex organisms, DNA repair systems postpone aging by preventing mutations, which ensures cell and tissue function and suppresses cancer, and by promoting rapid repair, which prevents apoptosis and senescence, cellular responses to DNA damage that suppress cancer but are thought to contribute to aging.  
  
Werner syndrome (WS) is hereditary progeroid syndrome in humans caused by loss of WRN, a DNA  helicase related to a bacterial DNA repair protein. WS manifests after puberty with multiple age-related  phenotypes and pathologies, including an aged appearance, atherosclerosis, type II diabetes, cataracts, osteoporosis and cancer. About half the cancers are mesenchymal, compared to <10% in the general population. WS individuals typically die of cardiovascular disease or cancer in the fifth decade of life. WRN deficient mice do not show WS phenotypes. WRN has been shown to modulate the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), and may play a role in telomere maintenance. Thus, WRN is a human longevity assurance gene that participates in multiple genome maintenance processes with cell-type and species specificity.  
  
To understand how WRN functions to postpone aging, we propose to determine the role of WRN and its catalytic activities in the responses to DNA damage, including senescence, apoptosis, replicative life span, telomere dynamics, and DSB repair. We also propose to explore the cell type specificity of WRN action and test the hypothesis that diverse cell types respond differently to WRN deficiency. Finally we propose to explore the species specificity of WRN action by determining whether there are differences between mouse and human cells in WRN regulation, localization or function.  
  
Understanding WRN function will provide a unique opportunity to understand an important human longevity assurance mechanism with a level of sophistication that includes cell type and species specificity, which are at present poorly understood.","398023",

Despite recent advancements in medical intervention, babies born with cleft palate often suffer multiple handicaps that significantly compromise the quality of their lives. Cranial neural crest (CNC) is an important population of multipotent embryonic progenitor cells, which ultimately contribute to a diverse array of differentiated craniofacial tissues, including the palatal mesenchyme, and plays an integral role during palatogenesis. An understanding of the manner in which CNC cells contribute to palatal development and the molecular mechanism, which regulates the fate of CNC are critical for understanding normal craniofacial development as well as CNC-related congenital malformations. Multiple growth and transcription factors have been identified as critical regulators for palatogenesis. Specifically, TGF-beta plays a pivotal role in regulating the fate of medial edge epithelium during palatal fusion. It is not well understood, however, what is the functional significance of TGF-beta signaling in regulating the fate of CNC derived palatal mesenchyme. To address this issue, we have generated an animal model with conditional TGF-beta type II receptor (TGF-beta IIRfl/fl;Wnt1-Cre) gene ablation in neural crest cells. These TGF-beta IIRfl/fl;Wnt1-Cre mice show cleft palate and other craniofacial defects with 100 percent phenotype penetrance. Significantly, there is normal CNC migration into the first branchial arch of TGF-beta IIRfl/fl;Wnt1-Cre embryos, indicating that disruption of TGF-( signaling does not adversely affect CNC migration. Therefore, TGF-beta-mediated gene expression is specifically required locally during palatal development. Taking advantage of our TGF-beta IIRfl/fl;Wnt1-Cre and other mutant animal models we design studies to investigate the hierarchy of TGF-beta signaling in regulating the fate of CNC cells during palatogenesis by testing the hypothesis that TGF-beta signaling regulates the expression of homeobox gene Msx1, which in turn controls the progression of cell cycle to regulate the fate of CNC-derived palatal mesenchymal cells during palatogenesis. Ultimately, this study will provide a better understanding on how the TGF-beta signaling cascade regulates the fate of CNC cells during normal craniofacial development and how signaling disruption can lead to craniofacial malformations.","343920",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of our laboratory is to understand signaling mechanisms that underlie both normal and abnormal heart development as well as mechanisms that can cause congenital heart disease. Indeed, 1-2% of newborns have some form of congenital heart disease making it the most common congenital birth defect. Many of these cardiovascular defects are related to the formation and remodeling of endocardial cushion tissue into the valves and membranous septa of the heart. We have documented that the retinoid X receptor alpha null (RXRalpha-/-) mouse is an excellent model system to aid our understanding of how retinoic acid signaling influences heart development. Lethality in the embryonic day (E) 13.5 RXRalpha-/- mouse is marked, in part, by elevated TGFbeta2 and enhanced apoptosis in the outflow tract. TGFbeta2 primarily signals through phosphorylation (p) of Smad2/Smad3. pSmad2 and pSmadS show a striking coincident localization with apoptosis in E13.5 cushion mesenchyme suggesting they play a key role in programmed cell death and remodeling events mediated by TGFbeta2. Preliminary Western blot data demonstrates co-treatment of isolated trypsin-dispersed heart cells with retinoic acid and TGFbeta2 for one hour resulted in a synergistic phosphorylation of Smad2/Smad3 compared to each agent alone. This novel interaction is not due to transcriptional effects of RXRa since the effects were seen after only a one-hour treatment. Conversely, in the RXRalpha-/-, immunohistochemistry shows a lack of nuclear localized pSmad2/pSmad3 in the outflow tract. These data demonstrate a novel and significant crosstalk between the retinoic acid and TGFbeta2 signaling cascades in the developing heart that has not previously been realized. Thus, while long-term transcriptional effects of retinoic acid signaling are well documented, effects of short-term activation of the pathway have not been studied. Thus, we hypothesize that retinoic acid signaling can function in a rapid response manner to modulate TGFbeta2-mediated effects during outflow tract remodeling. Using whole mouse embryo cultures, primary cell cultures, and genetic crosses we propose three aims to test this hypothesis: 1) To determine the influence of retinoic acid on TGFbeta2 signaling in the heart and to assess the role for RXRalpha in these processes. 2) To determine how retinoic acid signaling regulates TGFbeta2-induced apoptosis and remodeling in the outflow tract. 3) To determine if RXRalpha directly interacts with Smad signaling in the outflow tract.

DESCRIPTION, OVERALL (provided by applicant):  
Islet cell transplantation represents a logical approach to a curative treatment for type 1 diabetes mellitus. However, even if the obstacles associated with transplantation, such as immunosuppression, are overcome in the future, the supply of islets remains a major problem. Clearly, novel strategies are critically needed to provide sufficient islet material for all potential patients. Embryonic stem cells (ES) offer a promising source for in vitro generation of beta cells, but before this will become reality, several challenges should be surmounted. One major issue is the limited knowledge of the developmental processes that govern patterning, growth, and differentiation in the developing embryo. The central theme of this Program is to investigate the biology of pancreatic progenitor cells. We will generate novel mouse strains and use these to investigate how pancreatic progenitor cells (PPC) are specified and how the formation of endocrine progenitor cells (EPC) is regulated? Additionally, we will investigate the mesenchymal signals that control the proliferation and endocrine lineage commitment of the PPC as well as the signals that direct the proliferation and differentiation of the EPC. We will investigate the mechanisms by which Ngn3 induce generic endocrine- and endocrine subtype-specific differentiation events as well as the mechanisms by which genes such as Nkx6.1, Arx, and Pax4 regulate endocrine subtype specification. Lastly, we will test whether the mechanisms used in the embryo for regulation of endocrine development are also utilized for beta cell formation in adults after partial pancreatic duct ligation, or whether beta cells under these circumstances are formed purely by replication of pre-existing beta cells. To accomplish our objectives we are building on previously established collaborations between the different investigators and we are expanding these to include the generation of novel tools that will be shared across project boundaries, with other BCBC investigators, and with the community at large. In particular, in this proposal we will generate several novel mouse lines and use these to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate beta cell development.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of this research project is to develop a continuous in vitro culture system for a human malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax, which currently cannot be maintained in vitro for an extended period of time. The resulting system will be used for culturing P. vivax parasites from human patients to conduct important biological studies of P. vivax, such as drug resistance, and development of novel antimalarial drugs and vaccines. This will help with prevention and treatment of the disease caused by the parasite in endemic areas. To accomplish this goal, we will develop a system to obtain human reticulocytes, which is essential for P. vivax growth, by directing differentiation of the hematopoetic stem cells (HSCs) isolated from human umbilical cord blood (UCB), by using recombinant cell factors and co-culture with mouse or human stromal cells. The resulting reticulocytes will be infected with Plasmodium parasites (P. falciparum and P. vivax) to test if they can support growth of the parasites. The method for cryo- preservation of the cultured reticulocytes will also be studied for distribution of the reticulocytes to research laboratories and field sites.   
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The primary goal of this research project is to develop a continuous in vitro culture system of human reticulocytes for propagating a human malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax. Currently, this system is not available and its absence impedes the development of drugs and/or vaccines for malaria caused by this parasite. To accomplish this goal, human reticulocytes will be developed through the directed differentiation of hematopoetic stem cells (HSCs) isolated from human umbilical cord blood (UCB). The enriched human reticulocytes will be tested for infection with Plasmodium parasites. Various methods for cryo- preservation of the cultured reticulocytes will be evaluated to create a qualified, long-term supply of the new culture system.

processes. Cell proliferation and differentiation duringnormal development and tumor progression are
regulated by multiple interacting signaling pathways, and it appears that specific biological responses often
arise as the consequence of such interactions. Understandingthe basic rules and the context in which these
pathways interact thus has become a fundamental challenge for basic and cancer biology. In the following
proposal we will use Drosophila as a highly genetically tractable in vivo model system to explore signaling
network architecture and function. As a specific example, we will investigate the functionally important
interactions between the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and transforming growth factor-6 (TGF6)
pathways found in many developmental and pathological situations such as cell fate determination,
differentiation, and tumor metastasis. In particular,we will study their interactions in controlling cell
differentiation of Drosophila wing vein cells (a type of specialized epithelial cells). Our recent studies and
those of others suggest that the two pathways not only upregulateeach other's activities but are also both
required for vein cell differentiation.In this proposal, we will focus on investigatinghow the EGFR and Dpp
(a Drosophila homolog of TGF8) pathways reciprocallyaffect each other's activities and how they act
together to instructtissue differentiation. In this research proposal, we will test three main hypotheses: (1) the
cell-autonomous EGFR-Dpp positive-feedback signalingcycle converts a transient and reversiblesignaling
pathway activation to a self-sustainable and lasting ""active state"" of both pathways, which induces and
maintains the irreversible process of cell differentiation,its coordination with cell cycle regulation, and the
establishment of lateral inhibition, (2) the biological effects of the EGFR-Dpp signaling cycle are achieved in
part by combinatorial transcription regulation of specific target genes, and (3) lateral inhibition by the Notch
pathway is mediated via inhibitionof the EGFR-Dpp cycle in intervein cells. Results from the proposed
research will elucidate a novel mechanism of signalingcrosstalk between the EGFR and Dpp pathways in a
developmental context and should shed light on how these two signaling pathways cooperate in a variety of
normal developmental as well as pathological situations such as tumor metastasis.","233273",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene therapy approaches involving constitutive overexpression of cDNAs encoding individual BMPs can induce bone formation and partially repair cranial and long bone defects as shown by this laboratory. However, this strategy is limited by the availability of BMP-responsive osteoprogenitor/stem cells at the regeneration site and lack of control over the timing and duration of regenerative factor expression. The underlying hypothesis of this competitive renewal is that bone regeneration can be greatly improved if gene therapy is used to mimic the natural processes of bone development and fracture repair characterized by the participation of multiple growth/differentiation factors whose expression is under tight temporal control. Of particular importance are factors such as BMPs that may function as heterodimers to stimulate progenitor differentiation and FGF2 that controls progenitor proliferation. This project, which contains both translational and basic science components, will compare the efficacy of regenerative approaches in well-defined preclinical models as well as explore underlying mechanisms by achieving the following specific aims:   
Aim 1. Evaluate actions of an adenovirus expressing FGF2 (AdFGF2) on osteoprogenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in vitro and in vivo with or without Ad BMPs. Hypothesis: AdFGF2 can expand the population of osteogenic precursors at regeneration sites to enhance bone formation.   
Aim 2. Use inducible gene expression systems to control the timing, duration and sequence of osteogenic factor synthesis. Hypothesis: Enhanced control of osteogenesis can be achieved using regulated gene expression to control the timing, duration and sequence of proliferative versus osteoqenic signals.   
This project will test novel regenerative concepts involving cooperative interactions between proliferative and osteogenic factors and temporal regulation of factor synthesis using simple rodent models. Approaches developed will provide proof of principle of the eventual development of new therapies for bone regeneration that mimic natural biological processes by providing temporal control over regenerative events.

breast carcinoma cells to form xenografts and progress to metastasis will be assessed using shRNA. Aim 2

functioning as a co-receptor for NP-1 to mediate VEGF16s signaling. The hypothesis that NP-1/plexin A1
signaling functions to evade apoptosis by inhibiting GSK-3|3 and activating NFicB will also be pursued in Aim
2. Aim 3 will investigate the relationship between VEGFi65/NP-1 signaling and the dissolution of epithelial
architecture that is associated with the genesis of invasive and metastatic cancers. Specifically, the
hypothesis that normal mammary epithelial cells and highly differentiated carcinoma cells are independent of
VEGF16s/NP-1 survival signaling but that these cells become dependent on VEGF-|65/NP-1 signaling during
the epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In addition, the ability of hypoxia to stimulate an EMT by activating
Akt, inhibiting GSK-Sp and inducing the expression of Snail, a transcription factor that represses E-cadherin
will be studied.
The contribution of VEGF to vascular and lymph angiogenesis dominated and, in fact, continues to dominate
the study of this growth factor in breast and other cancers. Undoubtedly, this function of VEGF is essential.
An important implication of our work, however, is that it challenges the notion that the function of VEGF in
cancer is limited to angiogenesis and that therapeutic approaches based on the inhibition of VEGF function
target only angiogenesis. In fact, therapy aimed at targeting either VEGF or VEGF receptors is showing
considerable progress in clinical trials with late-stage cancer patients and the possibility that such therapy is
targeting VEGF signaling in tumor cells is likely. For this reason, a rigorous understanding of the
mechanisms used in this signaling and its relevance to breast cancer is essential.","293995",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): GENES INDUCING BLADDER SMOOTH MUSCLE FORMATION The goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanism of bladder smooth muscle formation. Previously, we have shown that the induction of bladder smooth muscle is dependent on an epithelial signal to the undifferentiated bladder mesenchyme. The key question is what are the signals or gene products from the urothelium that control bladder smooth muscle formation. The hypothesis of this proposal is that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling from bladder urothelium acts as a morphogenetic switch, inducing as well as inhibiting bladder smooth muscle formation as a function of Shh concentration. We propose that Shh signals the adjacent undifferentiated bladder mesenchyme to activate the Shh receptor Patched (Ptc). In turn through the downstream Shh signaling pathway, Serum Response Factor (SRF) is activated localizing to the periphery of the bladder. Subsequently the activated SRF pathway induces smooth muscle formation in the periphery of the bladder away from the Shh inducing epithelium. This would explain the two fundamental features of embryonic bladder development: 1) epithelium is necessary for bladder smooth muscle formation and 2) smooth muscle formation occurs at a defined distance in the peripheral bladder mesenchvme away from the inducing epithelium. Specific Aim # 1 and #2 will define the ontogeny of smooth muscle structural proteins and regulatory proteins in the Shh and Serum Response Factor pathways during bladder development in wild- type and Shh null mouse embryos. Specific Aim #3 (Blocking Experiments) will disrupt Shh signaling during murine bladder development which should impair smooth muscle formation. Specific Aim #4 (Gain of function) will induce bladder smooth muscle in undifferentiated bladder mesenchyme with A) recombinant Shh impregnated microbeads and B) an over-expressing Shh cell line. Tissue recombination experiments will be performed in specific aim #5 to control smooth muscle patterning as a function of normal and ectopic urothelial (Shh) signaling. In summary, we have designed experiments to explore the role of Shh both as an inducer and inhibitor of bladder smooth muscle formation via activation of the SRF pathway. Understanding the mechanism of bladder smooth muscle formation has the potential to facilitate development of new therapeutics to prevent bladder fibrosis, the sequelae of congenital hydronephrosis and the treatment of urinary incontinence.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Conditions in which cartilage calcification is aberrant affect both the new born and the elderly (e.g., birth defects, growth deformities, rickets, and unwanted cartilage calcification in end-stage osteoarthritis and ""tissue engineered"" cartilage repair. To understand and manage these conditions it is essential to under- stand physiologic cartilage calcification. Based on results of the previous funding period we plan to test the hypotheses (1) that cartilage calcification does not require prior apoptosis in the mouse, as we have already demonstrated in the chick, (2) that there is a family of extracellular phosphorylated matrix proteins that are important for regulation of mineralization in the growth plate, (3) that.aggrecan degradation is required for physiologic cartilage calcification to occur, and (4) that there are certain key regulators and matrix factors that differentiate the culture that will be mineralizable from non-mineralizable cultures. To test these hypotheses and gain additional insights into the mechanism of chondrocyte-mediated calcification we propose to use a mouse cell line along with the chick limb-bud mesenchymal cells to allow access to additional crucial reagents. With the recent availability of the chick gene array we are able to look for the ""key factors"" that differentiate mineralizing and non-mineralizing cultures in the chick and confirm them in the mouse. Our primary outcome for all these studies will be the amount and properties of the mineral that is deposited. The specific aims are: 1: To verify that chondrocytes apoptosis is not essential for cartilage calcification in the mouse cell line known to under go endochondral ossification. 2: To expand our ongoing studies of the importance of modification of matrix proteins by specific matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and cathepsins. 3: To determine which phosphoproteins made by hypertrophic chondrocytes and found in calcified cartilage are responsible for the initiation and regulation of cartilage calcification using a combination of immuno-localization, immuno-blocking, and addition of extraneous protein to cultures, and to verify any critical role with knockdown experiments using RNAi. 4: To use the chick gene array to discover novel factors that distinguish mineralizing from non-mineralizing micromass cultures, and verify these in both the chick and the mouse cell lines by immuno-localization, immuno-blocking, over expressing or blocking (RNAi) the expression of specific genes, and demonstrating their effects on mineralization.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transforming Growth Factor-??(TGF?) controls tissue homeostasis by inhibiting cell cycle progression, inducing differentiation and apoptosis, and maintaining genomic integrity. Secondly, TGF??orchestrates the response to tissue injury and mediates repair by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and by increasing cell motility and -invasiveness in a time- and space-limited manner. While tumors escape from TGF?'s homeostatic function early on in their development, many metastatic breast cancers appear to have co-opted the tissue repair function to enhance their invasive/metastatic phenotype. Our core hypothesis is that whether or not a particular tumor cell is capable of successfully establishing a metastasis within a particular foreign microenvironment will depend on TGF¿?signaling in the tumor cell as well as on the effects of TGF??on the host cells at the secondary site. Using a unique model of metastatic breast cancer developed by Dr. Kang, Specific Aim 1 will determine whether or not the anti-metastatic efficacy of TGF??pathway inhibitors is a function of the type of metastasis. Specific Aim 2 will determine whether the ability of mammary carcinoma cell lines to successfully establish metastases is predominantly dependent on TGF??actions on the mammary carcinoma cells themselves (so called cell autonomous effects), while Specific Aim 3 will determine the role of TGF??actions on host cells in this process. Finally, as the two major classes of TGF??pathway antagonists (macromolecules that act as ligand traps and chemical kinase inhibitors) have distinct biological and pharmacological properties, Specific Aim 4 will address the question whether and how these differences affect their therapeutic efficacy in metastatic breast cancer. Thus, the global goal of this project is two-fold: (1) The first is the fundamental one of dissecting the roles of TGF??and TGF?/Smad signaling play in the complex symbiotic relationship between a putative metastatic breast cancer cell and the metastatic niche at different secondary sites. (2) The second is the more translational goal of assessing the relative therapeutic merits of the different classes of TGF??pathway antagonists that are being developed for clinical use, with the intent of informing the design of future clinical trials. The proposed studies will have major implications for the health of patients with breast cancer. This is the most common cancer in women, and accounts for the second to highest number of cancer deaths in women. As most of these women die of metastases, elucidating the fundamental mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis and developing novel targeted agents to either treat or prevent metastasis will likely have a major impact on the outcome of women with this disease.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Wnt signaling plays a critical role in normal development and cancer. This competitive renewal will determine the role played by the Wnt signaling in the formation of mesenchymal-derived lineages in the lung with an emphasis on parabronchial smooth muscle cells (PSMC). During organogenesis, the peristaltic movements generated by smooth muscle cells are essential to build up the internal pressure in the developing lung, physical force required for lung growth. Our proposal focuses on survival, proliferation and differentiation of the PSMC progenitors located in the peripheral mesenchyme during lung development. In the previous funding cycle, we have shown that these cells express Fgf10 and are located in the sub-mesothelial mesenchyme. These cells progressively relocate around the bronchi and under the influence of Bone morphogenetic 4, a growth factor expressed in the epithelium at high level and partially controlled by FGF10 itself, undergo differentiation into smooth muscle cells (Mailleux et al., 2005). In addition, we have also shown that FGF9, produced initially by the mesothelium was capable of maintaining the PSMC progenitors into an undifferentiated state both in vitro (del Moral et al., 2006) and in vivo (De Langhe et al., 2006). The key mechanistic paradigm that we will test in this proposal is that (-catenin signaling in the mesenchyme requires the formation of an active (-catenin/PITX2 transcriptional complex that will regulate the expression of Pitx2, Fgfr2 and c-Myc. In turn Fgfr2 and c-Myc are instrumental to control survival, proliferation and differentiation of PSMC progenitors. Central Hypothesis: (-catenin/PITX2 signaling axis in the mesenchyme controls survival, proliferation and differentiation of parabronchial smooth muscle cell progenitors during lung development in vivo. Aim 1: To determine the role of (-catenin signaling in the formation of the PSMCs by a loss of function approach by inactivating (-catenin throughout the lung mesenchyme (using the Dermo1Cre driver line) or in PSMC progenitors (using a Fgf10rtTA driver line). The preliminary data generated for this aim allow us to propose three sub-hypotheses that will be tested. Sub-hypothesis 1: (-catenin signaling in the mesenchyme requires the formation of a privileged (-catenin/PITX transcriptional complex. Sub-hypothesis 2: (-catenin/PITX signaling controls the expression of Fgfr2. Sub-hypothesis 3: FGFR2 signaling in the mesenchyme via PITX2 controls the formation of PSMC. HEALTH RELEVANCE: During organogenesis, the peristaltic movements generated by smooth muscle cells are essential to build up the internal pressure in the developing lung, physical force required for lung growth. Our proposal focuses on the role of (-catenin signaling in survival, proliferation and differentiation of the parabronchial smooth muscle cells progenitors located in the peripheral mesenchyme during lung development. We propose that this work will be useful to better understand pathologies where mesenchymal cells in general (whether they are undifferentiated or not) are affected. For example, abnormal proliferation of the smooth muscle cells around the bronchi occurs in several human chronic diseases such as asthma, broncho-pulmonary dysplasia and lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed studies determine the biological function of Lmp4 in heart development, alone and in association with Tbx5. This may provide new explanations for the wide range of phenotypes observed in Holt-Oram syndrome patients. To address the functional role of Lmp4 in heart development, we genetically inactivated the gene in the mouse. Utilizing the Lmp4 knockout mouse model, the proposed research will specifically test the hypothesis that Lmp4 functions as a regulator of Tbx5 subcellular localization in heart and coronary vasculature development. Lmp4 and Tbx5 expression will be analyzed in Lmp4 mutant mice, in comparison to wild type mice, providing insight into whether Lmp4 has a direct influence on Tbx5 subcellular distribution in an Lmp4 dosage dependent manner. The morphological phenotypes associated with genetic Lmp4 inactivation in the developing mouse heart will be analyzed in conjunction with Lmp4 and Tbx5 expression domains. This will determine whether the phenotypes are a direct result of compromised Lmp4 expression, or an indirect effect via altered Tbx5 subcellular localization. Primary epicardial cells cultured from homozygous Lmp4 mouse hearts will be used to determine the mechanistic function of Lmp4 alone and in association with Tbx5. The migratory behavior of the Lmp4 mutant cells will be assessed following rescue by transfection with full-length Lmp4 and rescue by transfection with Lmp4 constructs that lack the LIM3 domain Tbx5 binds. Lmp4 is a member of the PDZ-LIM family of proteins that function in critical biological processes such as organ development. Tbx5 is a member of the T-box family of transcription factors that has critical roles in many aspects of organogenesis. The overall goal of this proposed research is to elucidate the functional role of the interaction of Lmp4 and Tbx5 in heart development, which may provide new insights into heart/limb phenotypes observed in Holt-Oram syndrome.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major dose limiting toxicity of chemoradiotherapy of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung is irradiation esophagitis. This application seeks to prove that ionizing irradiation limits reparative stem cell engraftment of the irradiated esophagus through continuous reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by cells of the microenvironment, and that the mechanism of amelioration of toxicity by intraesophageal MnSOD-Plasmid Liposome (PL) (antioxidant) gene therapy is by stabilizing the antioxidant pool. We have demonstrated that intra-esophageal administration of MnSOD-PL decreases the toxicity of single fraction or fractionated radiotherapy to the mouse esophagus, decreases irradiation-induced glutathione and thiol depletion, lipid peroxidation, and enhance the survival of intravenously injected esophageal stem cells isolated by either side population (SP) cell sorting or 7-day pre-plate technique. We propose to utilize MnSOD-PL antioxidant therapy to enhance engraftment by reducing ROS production by the microenvironment. We will use three assays for measuring irradiation-induced toxic ROS effects on bone marrow derived esophageal stem cell engraftment: 1) clonal homologous recombination (HR) in donor male C57BL/6J (FYDR) cells; 2) fusion of donor cells with recipient esophagus; and 3) apoptosis of both resident and engrafted esophageal stem cells. The first specific aim tests the hypothesis that homing and proliferation of bone marrow origin serially transplantable esophageal progenitor cells from G418r LacZ+ (B6.129S7-Gt(ROSA)26Sor/J) male mice to the irradiated female recipient esophagus results in cell dose dependent irradiation protection, and correlates with recovery of G418r LacZ+ colony forming squamous cell progenitors in vitro. The second specific aim tests the hypothesis that irradiation-induced ROS, specifically peroxynitrite, in the microenvironment of the irradiated female mouse esophagus induces HR in donor C57BL/6J male (FYDR) marrow SP cells quantitated as clonal yellow foci, cell fusion with recipient esophageal cells and apoptosis. The third specific aim tests the hypothesis that restoration of antioxidant reserves in the irradiated esophagus by MnSOD-PL treatment, in both ROSA and FYDR marrow cell transplantation models, stabilizes marrow stem cell engraftment. Methods include engraftment of donor esophageal and hematopoietic stem cell subsets from male C57BL/6J, FYDR, and selectable G418 resistant LacZ (ROSA) male donors into irradiated recipient C57BL/6J female GFP+ mice, cell sorting, FISH, biochemical measurements of antioxidants in vitro and in vivo, and assays for direct and bystander killing. These studies should elucidate the molecular mechanism of induction of damage to engrafting marrow origin, epithelial stem cells by the irradiated esophageal microenvironment and identify new targets for therapeutic intervention.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Craniofacial skeletal development is specified by a coordinated temporal and spatial pattern of gene expression. It involves both intramembranous and endochondral ossification. Ultimately, secreted morphogens such as transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenetic proteins, hedgehog proteins and wingless proteins signal to key transcription factors to specify gene expression. The comparative phenotypic study of human and mouse genetic craniofacial skeletal malformation syndromes is a powerful approach for dissecting these signaling pathways. Two such syndromes, cleidocranial dysplasias (CCD) and trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS) are caused by mutations in transcription factors RUNX2 and TRPS1 that are important in craniofacial skeletogenesis. The two phenotypes exhibit distinct as well as common clinical features that point to potential biochemical and genetic interaction. Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that TRPS1 serves a critical function in specifying chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations and chondrocyte differentiation including during chrondrocyte hypertrophy, though additional functions in proliferating chondrocytes and/or bone cannot yet be excluded. Furthermore, we hypothesize that Trpsl may accomplish this by modifying RUNX2 function in an antagonistic fashion. Our Specific Aims are to 1) characterize the craniofacial skeletal and dental phenotype of already generation Trpsl mutant mice on a histological and molecular level, 2) evaluate the consequence of overexpression of Trps1 in proliferating and hypertropic chondrocytes in vivo, 3) determine the context dependence of TRPS1 repression of RUNX2 both in vivo with transgenic mice and in vitro with cell models of osteoblast differentiation, and 4) determine whether TRPS1 and RUNX2 interact genetically by generating double mutant animals and biochemically by immunoprecipitation and protein binding studies. These studies will answer two important questions: What is the function of TRPS1 during craniofacial skeletal development? How does TRPS1 regulate RUNX2 activity? By combining human clinical genetics with mouse genetic and cellular approaches, these studies will provide new perspectives into the transcriptional mechanisms that govern craniofacial skeletal development including mesenchymal cell fate commitment and regulation of chrondrocyte hypertrophy.

programs of cellular growth and differentiation in the stomach. These actions are thought to be secondary to
the ability of the parietal cells to produce and secrete growth factors and morphogens, such as TGF-! and
Sonic hedgehog (Shh), in the gastric mucosa. Shh, in particular, is a peptide known to have important biological
actions in the stomach. Indeed, Shh null mice fail to develop a normal gastric epithelium and pharmachological
inhibition of Shh signaling in rodents, leads to enhanced proliferation of gastric epithelial cells and to diminished
expression of BMP-4, a mesenchymal protein that inhibits cellular proliferation and promotes epithelial cell
differentiation. The mechanisms that mediate the actions of Shh and BMP-4 in the stomach have been only
partially elucidated. We reported that the canine parietal cells express and release Shh and that both Shh and
BMP-4, induce H/K-ATP-ase gene expression. We also observed that transgenic expression in the gastric
epithelium of inhibitors of both Shh and BMP signaling, leads to enhanced MAPK activation, decreased H/KATP-
ase expression and to alterations in the architecture of the gastric mucosa. Accordingly, we hypothesize
that Shh promotes parietal cell maturation and differentiation and that it inhibits gastric epithelial cell
proliferation. We also propose that some of the actions of Shh might be mediated by its ability to regulate the
expression of BMP-4 and that this cross talk between epithelial and mesenchymal peptides constitutes an
important mechanism for the regulation of gastric epithelial cell homeostasis. In the first specific aim, we will
test the hypothesis that some of the actions of Shh in the parietal cells are mediated by its ability to stimulate
the expression of BMP-4 from gastric mesenchymal cells. In the second aim, we will examine the actions of
Shh and BMP-4 on the growth of canine gastric epithelial cells, focusing our efforts on the effect of these
peptides on the MAPK signal transduction pathway. In the third aim, we will investigate the effects of Shh and
BMP-4 in vivo, by using transgenic mice expressing inhibitors of both Shh and BMP-4 signaling in the gastric
mucosa. Through these studies, we hope to shed new insights that will have significant clinical implications
since our findings may contribute to a better understanding of diseases such as peptic ulcer and gastric cancer.","162216",

invasiveness and the metastatic phenotype in human colorectal cancer and other carcinomas. Inappropriate
activation of the canonical Wnt pathway is another critical event in the transition from normal epithelium to
the neoplastic phenotype in colorectal cancer. Although it is well accepted that perturbation of these
pathways represent important hallmarks of neoplastic tranformation, their mechanisms of transduction and
regulation under normal and pathological conditions are poorly understood. We have developed highly
reliable and sensitive assays for re-expression of E-cadherin in the SW620 colorectal cancer cell line that
normally expresses very low levels of E-cadherin. Similarly, we have also developed a robust biochemical
assay that recapitulates activation of the canonical Wnt pathway by the Wnt coreceptor, LRP6. Both of these
assays have been adapted for a 384-well format. We now propose to interrogate regulation of E-cadherin
expression and canonical Wnt signaling using a chemical genetics-based approach in a high-throughput
screen to identify compounds that induce expression of E-cadherin in SW620 cells and that perturb
degradation of beta-catenin and Axin, two key regulators of signaling through the canonical Wnt pathway.
Our initial screen of 6,400 small molecules has already identified several lead compounds in both of these
assays and we propose screen a total of 160,000 compounds. We propose to validate lead compounds from
this initial screen in a variety of in vitro and in vivo assays. Our preliminary studies indicate that the small
molecule trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, acts to induce E-cadherin expression in SW620
cells. We will explore its role in E-cadherin expression as well as its potential for regulating Wnt signaling.
Finally, we will identify the mechanisms of action and potential targets of validated compounds by testing
their effects on candidate cellular pathways as well as in biochemically reconstituted reactions."," ",

pathology of squamous cell cancers (SCC) of the aerodigestive tract, with the intent to develop novel
molecular diagnostic, prognostic as well as therapeutic tools to improve the outcome of patients with these
diseases. Since our discovery that most SCC cell lines are refractory to Transforming Growth Factor-I_
(TGFl_)-mediated cell cycle arrest, we have used a combination of molecular and immunohistochemical
approaches to show that loss of expression and/or mutational inactivation of TGFI_ receptors, or the
downstream mediators Smad2 and Smad4, results in global loss of TGFI_ responsiveness in a limited subset
of SCCs. These studies firmly established TGF_'s role as a tumor suppressor. However, for most cases, the
mechanisms of escape from TGFl_-mediated growth control remain unclear.
 Our first objective is to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms that account for loss of Smad2
activation or Smad4 deficiency found in a subset of human SCCs. Based on the key role Smad4 plays in
mediating TGF_'s tumor suppressive function, our second objective is to identify Smad4's transcriptional
targets and which of these mediate Smad4's tumor suppressive function.
 The second part of this grant tests the hypothesis that, during cancer development, TGFI_'s growth arrest
function can become uncoupled from its ability to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation
(EMT). In fact, under these conditions, constitutive activation of TGF_ signaling may enhance invasion and
metastasis. However, little is known about the mechanisms that determine TGFI_ response specificity. Our
objective is to test the hypothesis that TGFI_ signal strength, the kinetics of activation, nucleo-cytoplasmic
shuttling and dephosphorylation of the two R-Smads, Smad2 and -3, and their differential associations with
Smad4 and other cellular proteins are major determinants of TGFI_ cellular response specificity, and that
their disruption results in uncoupling of the growth arrest function from EMT seen in cancer. We are uniquely
positioned to address these questions because of the phospho-Smad2 and -3 antibodies that we have
produced, our access to highly selective and potent inhibitors of the T_R-I kinase, and large scale tissue
arrays of human SCC specimens to rapidly validate key experimental findings.","177091",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-invasive imaging of cell migration, trafficking, and homing is an emerging new field that can provide us with a deeper insight into the dynamics of cell-tissue interactions, as well as provide guidance for the development of novel therapies using stem cells. There is little question that the field of cellular therapeutics will eventually become important to treat, or possibly cure, a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, further development of sensitive, non-invasive imaging techniques that can be applied clinically is clearly warranted. We propose to develop magnetic particle imaging (MPI) as a novel technique for imaging of stem cells. This imaging modality is based on the non-linear magnetization curve of small superparamagnetic tracers already used with MRI cell tracking, but the technique itself is not related to MRI. In principle, MPI has several advantages over MRI: a) a 1000-fold higher sensitivity; b) the ability to absolutely quantify the amount of magnetic tracers and cells; c) ""hot spot"" interpretation without the confounding endogenous background signal present in MRI; and d) the absence of obscuring contrast from hemorrhage or traumatic injury. We have preliminary data that magnetically labeled cells can be detected in vitro at low concentrations with a prototype MPI instrument, and that there is a straightforward quantification of cell number and iron content. Following the optimization of labeling procedures with different particles, MPI will be further investigated in vivo in a rat model of focal transient ischemia using middle cerebral artery occlusion. Different doses of mesenchymal and neural stem cells will be infused either intra-arterially or intravenously. The evolution of ischemic stroke will be monitored with various MRI techniques, including perfusion imaging, diffusion weighted imaging, and pH imaging. The therapeutic efficacy of administered stem cells will be assessed using a four-tier behavioral scoring system. The total amount of targeted and localized cells in the ischemic lesion, as determined by MPI, will be correlated with lesion volume and behavioral scores. While this proposal may be viewed as high risk, we believe that all necessary components are in place in order to successfully develop cellular MPI for stem cell therapy of stroke. By using MPI to obtain a better insight in the dynamic processes that govern the in vivo (selective) homing and (non-selective) trapping of cells in the brain and other tissues, we aim to optimize the source of stem cells, administration route, and dose of cell injection, which may ultimately enhance the therapeutic efficacy of stem cell treatment in stroke patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stem cells have the potential to ameliorate or perhaps even cure neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke. We aim to develop a new imaging technique that uses magnetic particles for visualizing transplanted stem cells in the brain. If this new technique is developed successfully, it will help us to understand much better where the cells exactly go into the brain and elsewhere in the body, which will facilitate introducing these stem cells into patients.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Pathway to Independence Award outlines an initial two-year mentored training program followed by a three-year independent phase to expedite the transition to scientific independence for Dr. Lovvorn. In the initial mentored phase, Dr. Lovvorn proposes to expand his scientific skills and knowledge in the fields of Cancer and Developmental Biology through a multidisciplinary program under the supervision of Dr. Mark de Caestecker, a highly productive principle investigator and respected mentor at Vanderbilt University. With the endorsement of his Department Chair, Dr. Lovvorn currently is practicing a work effort formula that affords 75% of his weekday time for research purposes. The research plan detailed herein will provide Dr. Lovvorn with rigorous training in basic biochemistry techniques to test the functional significance of and mechanisms regulating nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the transcriptional co-factor CITED1 in Wilms' tumor. Under Dr. de Caestecker's guidance, Dr. Lovvorn has shown that expression of,CITED1, normally active in the developing but absent in the mature kidney, persists in both human and rat Wilms' tumors. He also has shown that the subcellular localization of CITED1 shifts from the cytoplasm in metanephric mesenchyme to the nucleus of malignant blastema, and that increasing levels of CITED1 expression in primary human Wilms' tumors correlate with advanced stages of disease. Dr. Lovvorn proposes two hypotheses from these observations: 1. CITED1 nuclear localization facilitates Wilms' tumor pathogenesis, and 2. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of CITED1 is dysregulated in Wilms' tumorigenesis. In his initial aim, Dr. Lovvorn will test the pathogenic significance of restricting CITED1 to the nucleus of Wilms1 tumor cells. He will generate two Wilms' tumor cell lines that misexpress either a predominantly cytosolic or nuclear fraction of CITED1 in the human Wilms' tumor cell line, WIT49, and will assess the effects of these manipulations on Wilms' tumor biology. In his second aim, Dr. Loworn, using mass spectrometry, will identify CITED1 binding partners that are specific to either subcellular compartment. These data will facilitate identification of CITED1 modifications and mechanisms regulating its nuclear retention in Wilms' tumor blastema.

Preliminary data suggest TCDD induces the retinoid-metabolizing Cytochrome P450 (Cyp) 2c39 gene and decreases the retinoid-responsive Homeobox (Hox) a13 gene in vUGS during this period (it is anticipated Hoxd13 is also reduced). The proposed research will examine the hypothesis that TCDD inhibits vUGS bud formation by an Ahr- and Cyp2c39-dependent reduction in retinoic acid that decreases Hoxa13/d13 expression. The proposed research will demonstrate TCDD exposure of C57B1/6J male mouse fetuses locally increases vUGS Cyp2c39 gene expression, locally decreases biologically active retinoid levels, and locally decreases Hoxa13/d13 gene expression.

Furthermore, this research will demonstrate increased retinoic acid metabolism in vUGS is a key mechanism for ventral prostatic budding inhibition by TCDD and budding can be restored by transiently reducing Cyp2c39 expression or supplementing retinoic acid to UGS organ cultures incubated with TCDD.","52048",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have: observed that p68 RNA helicase acquired substantially higher level of phosphorylation(s) at tyrosine residues in both metastatic cancer cell lines and tissue samples compared to that in non-metastatic cancer cell lines and tissue samples. P68 is not phosphorylated in non-cancerous tissues. We also found that phosphorylation of p68 at tyrosine 593 is required for epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), a critical event for cancer metastasis. The phosphorylated p68 promotes EMT by facilitating beta-catenin nuclear translocation and activating transcription of Snail gene. Our hypothesis is that the phosphorylated p68 is a new and important regulatory factor that plays important role(s) in promoting EMT and tumor progression/metastasis. The goals of this research proposal are two fold: (1) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism by which the phospho-p68 promotes EMT, and (2) to extensively test the role of the phospho-p68 in promoting cancer metastasis. In specific aim 1, we propose experiments to test the role of the p68 phosphorylation in promoting cancer metastasis both in xenograft mice model and in tissue samples from cancer patients. In specific aim 2, we design experiments to elucidate the mechanism by which the phospho-p68 activates Snail gene transcription. We will test whether the phospho- p68 use its protein-dependent ATPase activity to 'displace' HDAC1 from remodeling and deacetylation complex (NuRD) at Snail promoter. Most cancer-related deaths are the consequence of the cancer metastasis. Although an outline picture about the process of cancer metastasis is emerge, the detailed mechanism is still far beyond fully understanding, especially the cellular factors that contribute to each steps of cancer metastasis. In specific aim 3, we propose experiments to test whether the phospho-p68 actively 'transports' cytoplasmic beta-catenin to the nucleus. Our study will uncover a new molecular factor that is involved in cancer metastasis. Understanding the functional role of phospho-p68 will ultimately be applied to develop new strategies to the diagnosis/prognosis and treatment for cancer metastasis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Our long-term goal is to define the pathogenesis of DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome (DGS/VCFS) developmentally and genetically using mouse models. Heterozygous deletions at 22ql 1.2 are the molecular basis of DGS affecting many tissues whose normal development depends on neural crest cells. The genetic and developmental etiology of this syndrome is complex. The recent discovery that haploinsufficiency of Tbxl (the mouse homologue of a T-box gene mapped at 22q11.21) causes abnormal development of aortic arch arteries suggests a critical role for TBX1 in DiGeorge syndrome. Although approximately 90% of the patients have a common 3 Mb heterozygous deletion at 22ql 1.2, a significant number of syndromic patients have smaller deletions that do not overlap within the 3 Mb region. It is therefore difficult to explain this syndrome simply by a mutation of a single gene. Our recent study suggests that deletion of another 22q11.21 gene, CRKL (CRK-Like), mapped within the 3 Mb deletion region may also contribute to this syndrome. Homozygous deletion of CrkL (gene symbol Crkl) recapitulates a wide range of neural crest defects that closely mimic DGS. Furthermore, we have recently noted that haploinsufficiency of Crkl in a C57BL/6 congenic background. To provide insight into the etiology of DGS as well as the mechanisms of congenital heart defects, we propose the following specific aims: 1.  To determine the developmental mechanism of the cardiovascular defects in Crkl- embryos.  2. To determine the genetic pathways in which Crkl plays a role. To address these aims, we propose the following subaims: Subaim 1.1) To test the hypothesis that CrkL is required for proper neural crest contribution to the cardiovascular system; Subaim 1.2) To test the hypothesis that CrkL is essential for growth or survival of cardiac neural crest derivatives; Subaim 2.1) To determine the genetic hierarchy for which Crkl is essential; Subaim 2.2) To test the hypothesis that CrkL is involved in signaling pathways mediated by Src family kinases; Subaim 2.3) To determine the genetic interactions of Crkl with Tbxl for proper development of neural crest derivatives.

Since our discovery that most SCC cell lines are refractory to Transforming Growth Factor-Beta(TGFbeta)-mediated cell cycle arrest, we have used a combination of molecular and immunohistochemical approaches to show that loss of expression and/or mutational inactivation of TGFbeta receptors, or the downstream mediators Smad2 and Smad4, results in global loss of TGFbeta responsiveness in a limited subset of SCCs. These studies firmly established TGFbeta's role as a tumor suppressor. However, for most cases, the mechanisms of escape from TGFbeta-mediated growth control remain unclear. 
Our first objective is to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms that account for loss of Smad2 activation or Smad4 deficiency found in a subset of human SCCs. Based on the key role Smad4 plays in mediating TGFbeta's tumor suppressive function, our second objective is to identify Smad4's transcriptional targets and which of these mediate Smad4's tumor suppressive function. 
The second part of this grant tests the hypothesis that, during cancer development, TGFbeta's growth arrest function can become uncoupled from its ability to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT). In fact, under these conditions, constitutive activation of TGbeta signaling may enhance invasion and metastasis. However, little is known about the mechanisms that determine TGFI_ response specificity. Our objective is to test the hypothesis that TGFbeta signal strength, the kinetics of activation, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and dephosphorylation of the two R-Smads, Smad2 and -3, and their differential associations with Smad4 and other cellular proteins are major determinants of TGFbeta cellular response specificity, and that their disruption results in uncoupling of the growth arrest function from EMT seen in cancer. We are uniquely positioned to address these questions because of the phospho-Smad2 and -3 antibodies that we have produced, our access to highly selective and potent inhibitors of the TbetaR-I kinase, and large scale tissue arrays of human SCC specimens to rapidly validate key experimental findings.","331745",

TNC*), tenascin-X (TNX), tenascin-R (restrictin, TNR), and tenascin-W (TNW). Their functions in vivo are largely unknown, despite a large literature describing their myriad effects in vitro 1. We recently demonstrated an association of TNX-deficiency with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) 2, 3, a disorder of collagen metabolism causing hyperextensible skin and joints 4,5. Gene targeting studies showed that TNX regulates collagen deposition 6, probably through direct interaction with the collagen fibril. TNC is also collagen fibril-associated and preliminary studies show that TNC can correct the cellular defect in TNX-deficient fibroblasts, suggesting functional redundancy. TNX and/or TNC are induced in fibrotic conditions of heart, liver, skin and lung 1, leading us to wonder whether deficiency of these proteins might restrain fibrosis. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, a widely employed model of lung injury, is of particular interest because TNC is highly induced while TNX is down-regulated 7. Preliminary studies show that Tnc null mice are protected from bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis, while Tnx null mice have greater early mortality, but less late fibrosis. We hypothesize that TNC interacts with known epithelial and mesenchymal integrins, thereby modulating the expression of inflammatory chemokines by alveolar epithelium and facilitating TGF-beta-dependent myofibroblast activation and fibrosis. In contrast to bleomycin lung injury in mice, TNX is induced in humans with pulmonary fibrosis. We hypothesize that TNX over-expression will increase collagen
accumulation occurring after bleomycin-induced lung injury."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Recent studies suggest that reparative cells which contribute to healing in the lung following injury also possess regenerative capacity. Although the biology of post-natal lung regeneration is not well understood, mechanical pre-stress appears to be an absolute requirement for tissue regeneration to occur. Emphysema, a disease characterized by tissue destruction, is a potential target for cell-based therapy. This disease is associated with: 1) loss of resident reparative cells; 2) loss of the extracellular matrix that transmits pre-stress signaling; 3) and loss of pre-stress itself, the very signal required to trigger regenerative responses. Although these factors represent obstacles to the development of regenerative therapeutic strategies for emphysema, preliminary studies in our lab show that modulation of mesenchymal and epithelial cell proliferation using members of the fibroblast growth factor family complexed to carrier molecules in a biocompatible polymer can promote expansion of parenchymal tissues. The polymer scaffold, an air containing foam with mechanical properties similar to healthy lung tissue, effectively transmits stress to reparative/progenitor cells to promote proliferation and remodeling. Studies proposed here will test the hypothesis that 1) therapeutic post-natal lung tissue growth in emphysema can be achieved by augmenting the lung's innate healing response using growth factors to direct endogenous reparative lung cells following a localized mild injury; and that 2) the magnitude of this response can be modulated by altering pre-stress using concomitant bronchoscopic lung volume reduction therapy to increase transpulmonary pressures. We intend to advance this approach, known as pneumografting, into human trials under a physician-sponsored Investigation New Drug Application.","581083",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, debilitating, and ultimately fatal disease for which no effective therapy exists. Recent research has focused on mechanisms that regulate activation of fibroblasts, the cell responsible for excessive matrix protein secretion and fibrosis. Interestingly, a cellular isoform of the matrix protein fibronectin (cellular fibronectin; cFn), termed EIIIA cFn, is deposited prior to the development of fibrosis and is essential for fibroblast activation through integrin receptor signaling. Fibroblast activation also relies on decreased levels and/or activity of an intracellular phosphatase called PTEN, which induces EIIIA cFn production. Thus, this proposal will focus on the hypothesis that decreased levels and/or activity of PTEN induces EIIIA cFn production which promotes and amplifies fibroblast activation. Experiments outlined in this application will define the mechanism by which PTEN regulates fibroblast activation in vitro and in vivo. Among the questions to be addressed are: 1) How does PTEN regulate EIIIA cFn expression? (i.e. what intracellular mechanisms regulate EIIIA cFn production when PTEN is inhibited?) 2) How does EIIIA cFn influence fibroblast behavior, and which integrin receptors are involved? 3) Can fibroblast activation, and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis, be attenuated when EIIIA cFn binding by fibroblasts is blocked in vivo? 4) Can fibroblast activation and fibrosis be made to occur when adding EIIIA cFn back to an in vivo system lacking EIIIA fibronectin? The relevance of this research is to define, in a mechanistic fashion, the series of events that leads to inappropriate scar tissue formation (fibrosis) in the lungs. The studies outlined in this proposal will specifically address how lung injury progresses to fibrosis and whether experimental lung fibrosis can be prevented or reversed. Successful completion of these experiments may also identify novel, potentially therapeutic, agents to combat lung fibrosis.

be unable to manipulate assembly to maintain or induce repair of the tubular barrier. The current proposal
is based on recent breakthroughs which convincingly show that the multi-domain scaffolding proteins ZO-1
and ZO-2 are necessary for TJ assembly and are directly involved in linking early spot-like cadherin
contacts to continuous adherens junctions and subsequent recruitment of TJ proteins into barrier strands.
The goal of this project is to understand how the ZO proteins regulate the interactions between TJ proteins
that mediate different steps of TJ assembly. Studies will be conducted in renal cultured cell models. Aim
1 will test the hypothesis that binding of ZO-proteins to the transmembrane proteins occludin and tricellulin
is required for TJ strand assembly, and assembly is regulated by the Unique-6 domain of ZO proteins.
siRNA silencing and expression of mutated proteins in cultured renal epithelial MDCK cells will provide the
major technical approach. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ZO-proteins promote the expansion of E
cadherin-mediated adhesive complexes by promoting cell-cell adhesion and/or adherens junction
assembly. We will use RNAi silencing and transgene rescue to identify the molecular interactions with
promote ZO-1 activity at the adhesive contacts that are required for TJ assembly. Aim 3 will test the
hypothesis that ZO-1 promotes the de novo assembly and/or recruitment of f-actin at cell-cell contacts, and
these cytoskeletal interactions are required for dynamic reorganization of epithelial sheets during cyst
formation, tubulogenesis and wound healing. Aim 4 will use x-ray crystallography to elucidate the
structural basis for the interaction between ZO-proteins and occludin/tricellulin and their regulation by the
Unique-6 domain. We are in an ideal position to achieve these aims because of our past experience and
contributions to the field, preliminary studies demonstrating feasibility and appropriateness of our models,
availability of reagents and a history of synergistic collaboration between our cell biology (UNC) and
structural (UIC) teams. The significance of these results is that they will define basic cellular mechanisms
required for TJ assembly, which is fundamental to normal kidney function and altered in disease.","326648",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Down-regulation of E-cadherin expression is a hallmark of a key developmental program termed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process often exploited by cancer cells that display an invasive phenotype. The zinc finger transcription factor, Snail, is a powerful represser of E-cadherin gene expression that can function alone or together with the Wnt signaling cascade to induce EMT in normal as well neoplastic cells. In recent studies, we demonstrated that the Snail protein is embedded with beta-catenin-like motifs supporting its phosphorylation by GSK3beta and its subsequent beta-TrCP-directed ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Further, an operational model has been established wherein canonical Wnt signaling stabilizes intracellular levels of Snail and beta-catenin in cooperative fashion to engage transcriptional mechanisms that control the EMT program. Based on a body of new preliminary data, we now identify a novel regulatory cascade wherein canonical Wnt signaling and the beta- catenin/TCF transcriptional cascade initiate EMT by inducing the Axin2-dependent regulation of GSK3beta nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. By triggering nuclear GSK3beta export, nuclear Snail protein half-life is stabilized and a classic EMT program engaged - including cancer cell invasion and intravasation - via a process linked to the expression of membrane-anchored metalloproteinase gene family members. As such, we now propose to i) characterize the Wnt-initiated regulation of carcinoma cell EMT by the Snail/beta-catenin/TCF axis, ii) define the Snail-dependent regulation of beta-catenin/TCF-induced EMT by Axin2, iii) define the structure-function relationships underlying Axin2 nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking and Snail-dependent EMT and iv) characterize the Axin2-dependent control of GSK3beta nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking and its impact on Snail-dependent EMT. These studies should not only define the interlocking role of Wnt, beta-catenin/TCF and Snail in regulating EMT in cancer, but also identify new targets for therapeutic intervention.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): These studies are aimed at understanding the mechanisms that regulate tooth number and morphogenesis. We will take a genetic approach, using mice carrying mutations in Sprouty (Spry) genes, which encode proteins that antagonize signaling via Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs). The FGF signaling pathway plays a key role in orchestrating morphogenesis of the tooth as well as many other organs. Analyzing how alterations in FGF signaling perturb tooth development, when these alterations are caused by removing an antagonist of FGF signaling, will lead to new insights that could not be obtained by studying loss-of-function mutations in either individual FGF ligands or their receptors. Our specific goals are: 1) study mice lacking either Spry2 or Spry4 function, in which tooth buds anterior to the first molar develop into supernumerary teeth. In wild-type mice, these buds regress to yield a toothless diastema region. By analyzing gene expression, performing experiments in tooth organ cultures, and by analyzing the progeny of complex genetic crosses, we will determine how loss of Sprouty gene function enables diastema tooth buds to persist and develop into a tooth rather than regress. Our studies will lead to a better understanding of the normal mechanisms by which diastema buds are prevented from forming teeth in the mouse and by which molar development is regulated. 2) pursue our observation that inactivation of multiple Sprouty alleles has profound effects on incisor development, including development of duplicate incisors. We propose to study the normal morphogenesis of early incisors, and then examine how this process is disturbed by deletion of Sprouty gene function. 3) determine why remarkable tusk-like incisors develop in mice that are heterozygous for Spry2 and null for Spry4. We will focus on the role of FGF signaling in controlling fate decisions during embryogenesis and in regulating progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation in the adult. Results from these studies will enhance our understanding of the signaling pathways that control epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during organogenesis and will contribute to knowledge about the stem-cell niche in the adult mouse incisor.   
Public health implications: Through our studies we will learn more about how teeth normally develop and how this development goes awry in patients with dental abnormalities. We will also study the mechanisms that control stem cells in adult teeth, which may help to lay the groundwork for efforts to build new teeth.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term objective of this study is to provide insight into mechanisms of pathology in the spine through an understanding of signals involved in the formation of the axial skeleton as well as in the maintenance of tissue structure and function in the adult. We propose that signaling through Tgfbr2 regulates both the development of the axial skeleton and the maintenance of tissues in the adult spine. Members of the TGF-b superfamily are secreted signaling proteins that regulate many aspects of development and tissue homeostasis including growth, patterning, and cellular differentiation. Polymorphisms and mutations in human Tgfb genes have been associated with pathology in the adult spine. Previously, we generated transgenic mice that express a dominant-negative mutation of the TGF-B Type II receptor in post-natal skeletal tissue. The mice demonstrated a progressive skeletal disease with pathology resembling that observed in human spondyloarthropathies. We also recently showed that deletion of the TGF-b type II receptor in Col2a expressing tissue results in alterations in the development of the axial skeleton including failures in the formation of the vertebrae and intervertebral discs. The results together suggest TGF-b has an important role in regulating both embryonic development of the axial skeleton and tissue homeostasis in the adult spine, however, the mechanistic basis of TGF-b action in the axial skeleton is not known. We propose to address this issue using genetically altered mouse and primary cell culture models. We will test the following specific hypotheses: 1) Signaling through Tgfbr2 mediates development of the vertebrae by regulating the expansion of the sclerotome. 2) Signaling through Tgfbr2 mediates the development of dorsal vertebral structures by regulating dorsal migration of sclerotomal cells. 3) Tgfbr2 regulates the patterning of the sclerotome. 4A) Tgfbr2 directs differentiation of sclerotomal cells towards the annulus fibrosus phenotype. 4B) TGF-b regulates the formation and maintenance of the IVD by antagonizing BMP activity. Understanding how specific cellular differentiation pathways occur in the first place and how differentiation is maintained in the adult will provide a basis for repair and regeneration strategies in the spine.

At this environment-gene interface, the epithelium and underlying mesenchymal cells are activated to drive pathologic remodeling and smooth muscle proliferation through complex cytokine/chemokine/ growth factor/eicosanoid interactions.  We have demonstrated in a mouse model of asthma that cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT)1 receptor blockade inhibits the airway remodeling processes, including airway mucus gland and smooth muscle cell hyperplasia, collagen deposition, and lung fibrosis, as well as TH2 cytokine release, although considerable progress has been made in determining the role played by cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and secretory PLA2 (sPLA2)s in release of arachidonic acid (AA) for eicosanoid synthesis, with the recent identification of several new mammalians PLA2s, evaluation of the role of specific PLA2s in the mediation of allergic airway inflammation, remodeling, and AHR is indicated. The specific aims of this study are as follows: 
Specific Aim 1.  Determine the Role of sPLA2s vs. cPLA2 in the Mediation of Airway Inflammation and Airway Hyperreactivity (AHR) in a Chronic Mouse Model of Asthma.  We will study the profile of sPLA2 and cPLA2 expression in airway cells in a mouse asthma model with airway remodeling and determine the role of these enzymes in AA release and metabolism that leads to development of airway inflammation and AHR.  
Specific Aim 2. To Determine Whether Selective CysLT1 Receptor or PLA2 Blockade in a Murine Model of Asthma Reverses Established Allergen-induced Airway Remodeling and Fibrosis.  We will determine the relative efficacy of downstream (CysLT1 receptor antagonism) vs. upstream (sPLA2 or cPLA2 inhibition) blockade of the CysLT pathway on reversal of established airway remodeling in the mouse asthma model with comparison also to corticosteroid treatment.  Specific Aim 3. Determine the Effect of CysLT1 Receptor and PLA2 Blockade on Pro-Fibrotic Gene Expression in a Mouse Model of Airway Remodeling and Fibrosis. Functional genomic studies will be performed to determine the molecular mechanisms by which CysLTs mediate allergen-induced airway remodeling focusing on inflammatory response and TGF-(-inducible pro-fibrotic gene expression.","324915",

role of p190-B during mammary gland development and in breast cancer progression. p190-B was identified in our laboratory in a screen to isolate genes preferentially expressed in the terminal end buds (TEBs) during mammary gland ductal morphogenesis. Both estrogen and IGF-I are necessary for TEB proliferation, and data from p190-B null mice suggests that p190-B plays a critical role in regulating the IGF-I signaling pathway via the modulation of Rho kinase and IRS-1 levels. Furthermore, defects in TEB proliferation in p190-B heterozygotes, especially within the outer cap cell layer, are very similar to those observed in IGFR-null mammary epithelial transplants. Finally, during postnatal mammary gland development, interactions between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell adhesion molecules, including integrins, are essential for TEB proliferation. The p190-B protein is recruited to sites of integrin clustering, where it may both enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho proteins, as well as impact on the IGF-I signal transduction pathway. Thus, p190-B may facilitate cell motility and invasion by orchestrating ECM-mediated integrin signaling. These initial studies thus support the hypothesis that p190-B is essential for both embryonic and postnatal mammary morphogenesis, probably by facilitating the invasion of TEBs into the surrounding fat pad, and that its aberrant expression may facilitate breast cancer progression. To test these hypotheses, we propose to combine mouse genetics
with the in situ analysis of signal transduction pathways in models and in human tumor specimens. Specific emphasis will be placed upon studying the mechanisms by which the p190-B interacts with other signaling pathways regulated by the estrogen receptor and IGF-I, as well as with downstream effectors of the Rho pathway, to regulate TEB proliferation and migration. The aims are: 1) To analyze p190-B function in normal mammary development, using p190-B null and heterozygous mice, and Tet-regulatable transgenic mice overexpressing p190-B. 2) To elucidate molecular mechanisms by which p190-B might promote invasion and metastasis, using a Tet-regulatable p190-B-overexpressing MCF-7 cell model and MDA 231 cells where p190-B expression is knocked down using RNAi. 3) To determine the influence of p190-B on tumor formation and metastasis, using Tet-regulatable p190-B-overexpressing mice bred with a well characterized MMTV-luc-IRES-c-erbB2 transgenic mouse model. 4) To determine the correlation between p190-B expression and the evolution and metastasis of clinical breast cancer, in specimens from our extensive tumor banks."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
Hearts defects are the most common congenital defect and a major contributor to heart disease. Frequently, congenital heart diseases are diagnosed late in their progression, when treatments become temporary and have significant side effects. The applicant's long term goal is to establish an independent laboratory leveraging discoveries about the molecular basis of heart development into improved diagnostics and therapies for heart disease. During the remainder of his postdoctoral training at Stanford University, coursework in lab management, study of cardiovascular biology, laboratory research, and publication of manuscripts will support the applicant's transition to independency. Mentored and independent research will focus on the applicant's discovery that endocardial BAF chromatin remodeling complexes have remarkably specific roles in two heart regions. In the ventricles, the BAF complex determines the extracellular matrix required for morphogenesis of muscle cells into trabeculae by repressing transcription of a matrix protease, ADAMTS1. This regulation appears to be dynamic, as later in development ADAMTS1 expression increases to prevent excessive trabeculation. At the endocardial cushions that develop into valves, the BAF complex regulates an endocardial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) that gives rise to cushion-populating cells. I hypothesize that endocardial BAF complexes establish regulatory ""switches"" at key loci to control developmental events in different regions of the heart. In the ventricles, I propose the BAF complex is recruited to ADAMTS1 by specific cooperating factors to induce dynamic changes in nucleosome organization to repress transcription. In the cushions, I hypothesize the BAF complex regulates transcription of secreted regulators of Wnt signaling. Misexpression of these factors in the absence of the BAF complex induces a premature and ectopic activation of Wnt that blocks EMT. These hypotheses will be pursued using two Specific Aims: 1) Determine if microenvironment changes regulate cell signaling in the ventricles. Describe cis-and Trans acting factors that recruit the BAF complex to ADAMTS1. Delineate nucleosome modifications that cooperate with the BAF complex to repress ADAMTS1. 2) Determine if inhibiting Wnt signaling restores EMT in embryos lacking endocardial BAF complexes. Describe the expression of Wnt regulating transcripts as potential targets of the BAF complex in endocardial cushions.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Integrins are transmembrane heterodimeric 1 and 2 subunit glycoproteins that mediate the interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). In humans there are 18 1 and 8 2 subunits, which combine in a restricted manner to form dimers, each of which exhibit different ligand binding properties. Integrins play a critical role in organ development and morphogenesis as they modulate cell shape, polarity, growth and motility. 21 is the most abundantly expressed integrin subunit in the kidney and can bind at least 12 1 subunits. Its short cytoplasmic tail binds to many cytoplasmic molecules that are important for integrin-mediated signaling and modulation of the cytoskeleton. Although it is clear that 21 integrin is necessary for normal embryogenesis; its specific function in renal development is poorly characterized. Integrin 21-null mice die at the peri-implantation stage, thus making difficult, if not impossible, to analyze the role of this receptor in kidney development. Recent availability of FLOXED 21 integrin mice and mice with CRE-recombinase driven by nephron segment specific promoters now allow us to determine the role of 21 integrin in the development and/or function of specific nephron segments. In addition, with the ability to generate point mutant knock-in mice, it is possible to determine the role of the integrin cytoplasmic tail in organ development and/or function in vivo. The collecting system of the kidney is derived from the ureteric bud (UB) which undergoes repetitive bifid branching events during early development followed by a phase of tubular growth, elongation and differentiation. By crossing FLOXED 21 null and knock-in mice with mice that express cre when UB development commences (hoxb7 cre) or after the majority of branching morphogenesis has occurred (aquaporin2 cre), we will test the hypothesis that 21 integrin is critical for UB branching morphogenesis but is expendable for collecting duct growth, elongation and differentiation. Aim 1) Determine how loss of integrin 21 in the developing UB affects renal development and function. Aim 2) Determine the role of the 21 integrin cytoplasmic tail in renal collecting system development. Aim 3) Determine the mechanism whereby integrin 21 induces renal epithelial cell polarity and branching morphogenesis.Narrative and significance. The studies proposed in this grant application will provide insight into the mechanisms of normal kidney development. In addition, they will investigate the mechanisms whereby children develop abnormalities of the collecting system of the kidney, which is a common cause of end stage renal failure in the pediatric population.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mechanical forces generated in utero by repetitive breathing movements and by fluid distension are essential to mammalian lung development. However, the mechanisms by which pulmonary cells sense and transduce mechanical signals are largely unknown. The long-term goals are to define how mechanical forces promote lung maturation. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is critical for fetal lung development. Although past studies indicate that EGFR is important for differentiation of type II cells and stretch-mediated compensatory growth after pneumonectomy, the mechanisms by which EGFR is activated are not known. Our investigations have identified potential roles for the EGFR and specific integrins in stretch-induced fetal type II cell differentiation. Further studies have shown that this process may be mediated by force-induced release of EGFR ligands, since strain-induced type II cell differentiation was markedly inhibited when the ligand-binding domain of the EGFR was blocked with neutralizing antibodies. We also showed that conditioned medium from stretched cells promoted type II cell differentiation when added to unstretched cells. This hypothesis is further supported by experiments performed in fetal lambs, which demonstrate that lung fluid composition after tracheal ligation, and not just increase in intrapulmonary pressure, is critical to accelerate lung growth and differentiation. Therefore, the specific hypothesis of this application is that strain-induced differentiation of fetal type II cells is mediated via autocrine release of membrane-anchored EGFR ligands. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To identify EGFR ligands released by lung epithelial cells in response to mechanical strain that promote type II cell differentiation. 2) To analyze the signaling mechanisms by which mechanical stretch induces EGFR ligand release. 3) To demonstrate the physiological role of force-induced release of soluble growth factors in organotypic models of epithelial strain. Using the Flexercell Strain Unit apparatus, cell signaling techniques, modification of the proposed key signaling proteins by inducible or knockdown expression and EGFR and ADAM17 knockout mice, we will examine EGFR ligands released by force in fetal type II cells that promote lung differentiation. We will analyze the role of ADAM17 as the protease that cleaves membrane-anchored EGFR ligands after mechanical stimulation of integrin receptors. Finally, we will validate our in vitro findings using ex vivo fetal lung explant models. Based on the critical role played by mechanical forces during normal fetal lung development, the identification of key regulatory pathways activated by strain in fetal lungs may provide a unique opportunity to rescue the phenotype and to facilitate development of new approaches to accelerate lung maturation in clinical conditions where lung development is impaired, including pulmonary hypoplasia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia and postnatal lung growth in extremely-low-birth-weight infants.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are connections between hepatic function and acute lung injury: a) ARDS in the setting of hepatic failure is almost uniformly fatal; b) hepatic dysfunction is common in patients with ARDS; and c) animal studies demonstrate release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from the liver in response to endotoxemia or hepatic ischemia. In an in situ perfused swine preparation we find that endotoxin induced lung injury only occurs when the liver is included in the circulation. We conclude that endotoxin does not injure the lung directly, but ""primes"" the lung for injury that is mediated by endotoxin induced release of mediators from the liver. We hypothesize that: a) Direct effects of endotoxin prime the lung for injury, but injury requires mediators released from the liver; b) Endotoxemia induces increased hepatic expression of gene(s) encoding protein(s) secreted into the circulation that mediate liver dependent lung injury, c) Bone marrow derived stem cells are critical modulators of the acute inflammatory response to endotoxemia in both the liver and the lungs and; d) Suppression of endotoxin induced acute inflammation and lung injury by bone marrow cells is primarily an effect of a subset of non-hematopoietic, mesenchymal-like stem cells. We will test these hypotheses by: 1) Determining whether endotoxin ""priming"" of the lung for injury is necessary for injury caused by endotoxin induced release of mediators from the liver, determining molecular responses to endotoxemia in both the lungs and liver and identifying endotoxin induced mediators produced in the liver and released into the circulation that mediate lung injury; 2) Determining effects of bone marrow derived cells on endotoxin induced inflammation (lung and liver) and release of mediators by the liver, characterizing effects of these cells on endotoxin induced molecular responses, determining whether bone marrow cells must be delivered to both the lungs and the liver to prevent lung injury, and determining whether the population of effective marrow derived cells is non-hematopoietic and mesenchymal-like; and 3) Determining in vivo the effects of access to an expanded pool of bone marrow cells on endotoxin-induced inflammation and lung injury and characterizing the populations of cells recruited to the lungs and the liver in vivo following endotoxemia in a parabiotic mouse preparation. These studies will elucidate mechanisms of acute lung inflammation and injury and identify novel potentials for therapy.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of birth defect occurring in nearly 1% of live births. Cardiac septation defects account for nearly 50% of CHD. The majority of CHD has a multifactorial origin but increasing evidence suggests that genetic factors play a significant role. The identification of rare cases of familial CHD has been instrumental in uncovering genetic etiologies. The long-term goal of our research is to understand the molecular pathways that underlie the genetic etiologies of human CHD. Utilizing genome-wide linkage analysis, we discovered point mutations in GATA4, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor critical for normal cardiac development, that were associated with cardiac septal defects and other cardiac malformations. A GATA4 G296S mutation in a large pedigree with CHD revealed a novel functional interaction between GATA4 and TBX5, the genetic cause of Holt-Oram syndrome that is characterized by CHD. Consistent with this in vitro finding, Gata4 and Tbx5 displayed a genetic interaction as mice heterozygous for Gata4 and Tbx5 have a unique cardiac phenotype that results from defective endocardial cushion development. These findings allowed us an entry point to dissect the molecular pathways that are disrupted leading to CHD. While it is clear that Gata4 and Tbx5, as well as other transcription factors, play central roles in cardiac development and CHD, there is a major void in the understanding of the target genes that mediate the actions of these developmental regulators. This is one of the important goals of this proposal. The overall hypothesis is that GATA4 and TBX5 regulate common pathways critical for cardiac septation and other cardiac morphogenetic processes. The aims of this proposal are: Specific Aim 1. To determine the developmental processes and cell lineage(s) in which Gata4-Tbx5 interaction is necessary to result in cardiac defects seen in Gata4 Tbx5 embryos. Specific Aim 2. To understand the role of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in the cardiac phenotype of the Gata4 Tbx5 embryos. Specific Aim 3. To determine the role of the Gata4 G296S mutant protein during embryogenesis. Mice that harbor the G296S mutation in Gata4 will be generated and used to define the molecular and functional in vivo deficits of this point mutation.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Transforming Growth Factor-? (TGF?) controls tissue homeostasis and orchestrates the response to tissue injury and repair. Cancers escape from TGF? 's homeostatic function but can activate the tissue repair function to enhance their invasive/metastatic phenotype. This concept has led to the development of TGF? pathway antagonists for cancer treatment. However, the absence of biomarkers for TGF? ""pathway addiction"" is a major roadblock in the development of these agents for clinical use. Our central hypothesis is that TGF? receptor gene mutations are indicative of pathway addiction and, therefore, predictive of response to antagonists. Over 40 cancer-associated missense mutations of the types I or -II TGF? receptor genes (TGFBR1, TGFBR2) have been identified. We have recently found that some of these constitutively activate the T?R-II receptor kinase, associated with loss of Smad2/3 activation on the one hand, and with de novo activation of Smad1/5 and a highly motile and invasive phenotype on the other. Moreover, treatment with selective T?R-ll kinase inhibitors reversed the transformed phenotype. In parallel, Marfan syndrome-like genetic disorders have recently been attributed to mutations of TGFBR1 or TGFBR2. These mutations also confer an activated phenotype on patient fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. Moreover, striking parallels exist between cancer- and Marfan-like syndrome-associated TGFBR mutations: (1) TGFBR2 gene mutations are much more common than TGFBR1 mutations; (2) TGFBR2 mutations are clustered in the C-lobe of the T?R-II kinase; and (3) many of the TGFBR2 mutated in human cancers coincide with those involved in Marfan-like syndromes as well as with the TGFBR2 orthologue in D. melanogaster. Thus, converging experimental evidence from these three very different sources strongly supports the hypothesis that TGF? receptor gene mutations can confer an aberrant activated cellular phenotype. Our specific aims are: 1. To predict the effects of TGFBR2 gene mutations on interactions with other proteins using structural biology approaches; 2. To determine which TGFBR2 gene mutations confer gain-of- function phenotypes using genetic assays in D. melanogaster; 3. To determine the effects of TGFBR2 gene mutations on TGF? signaling in mammalian cells; 4. To utilize selective chemical T?R kinase inhibitors to determine their potential therapeutic effects on gain-of-function TGFBR2 mutant cells. These studies are particularly important because TGF? antagonists are in (pre)clinical development for the treatment of (metastatic) cancer as well as fibrotic disorders. Thus, not only will our studies provide a precise understanding of the molecular pathobiology of disease-causing TGFBR mutations, but they will also inform the clinical development of TGF? pathway inhibitors for cancer and other disorders.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  FGF8 deficient mice have been created to evaluate the role of this factor in pharyngeal and cardiovascular development. Great vessel and outflow tract septation and alignment defects we re found in 95% of the hypomorphic mutant mice; these include persistent truncus arteriosus and interrupted aortic arch. FGF8 is produced in the epithelia surrounding the mesoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells that populate the pharyngeal arches, and contribute to the cardiac outflow tract and great vessels. We hypothesize that the cardiovascular malformations in Fgf8 mutant mice result from defective FGF8 signaling between the pharyngeal arch ectoderm and endoderm, and the underlying mesenchyme. The objective of this project is to define the molecular and cellular pathways in which FGF8 participates during cardiovascular and pharyngeal development. To determine if mutant phenotypes are due to local deficiency of FGF8 in the arch epithelia, our first aim is to conditionally ablate FGF8 in the ectoderm and endoderm of the developing pharyngeal arches. Aim 2 is to evaluate the formation and evolution of aortic arch arteries and supporting tissues in Fgf8 mutants and define the role of FGF8 during vasculogenesis in the fourth pharyngeal arch. Our third aim is to investigate the molecular and cellular pathways that are dependent on FGF8 during pharyngeal and cardiovascular development by characterizing the alterations in gene expression, proliferation, and survival of pharyngeal neural crest, mesoderm and endoderm in Fgf8 hypomorphic and conditional mutants. We will identify specific populations of FGF- responding cells and determine how their differentiation and behavior are affected by deficiency or absence of FGF8.  
The array of phenotypes displayed by these FGF8 deficient animals is a remarkably complete  
phenocopy of human syndromes associated with deletion of chromosome 22q11. Delineation of the pathways in which FGF8 is participates will not only help us to define how those pathways guide normal development of pharyngeal structures, the cardiac outflow tract and great vessels, but will also provide insight into how dysfunction of those developmental programs gives rise to the common and lethal array of birth defects that result from deletion of genes in the human 22g11 region.

Differentiation of its specialized epithelial cells,
termed cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), is an important determinant of both its form and function. Our focus is the
pathway that gives rise to the invasive subpopulation of cells. During interstitial invasion, a subset of CTBs
commingles with resident decidual and immune cells. During endovascular invasion, these fetal cells invade
the maternal blood vessels, which they subsequently line. Together, these two components of CTB invasion
anchor the placenta to the uterus and divert uterine blood flow to the intervillous space. Given the
complexities involved in this explosive process, it is not surprising that anomalies sometimes occur.
Preeclampsia (PE), a syndrome that adversely affects the mother (by altering vascular function) and the
fetus (by restricting intrauterine growth), is a prime example. Interstitial and endovascular invasion is shallow,
and fewer spiral arteries are modified in toto. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular bases of the
placental defects that occur in PE and to explain their relationship to the clinical signs of this syndrome.
Previously, we showed that in normal pregnancy CTB invasion is accompanied by a phenotypic switch in
which these ectodermal derivatives take on many characteristics of endothelial cells. PE is associated with
specific deficits in this program as evidenced by defects in adhesion molecule switching and perturbations in
their production of angiogenic substances. Recently, we used an unbiased microarray approach to identify
novel pathways that function within the basal plate region where the placenta attaches to the decidua. First,
we studied the effects of advancing gestational age on gene expression in this area and then we examined
the impact of PE. The results of these experiments revealed a wealth of new information. For example,
consistent with the hypotheses to be tested in this program project, lipid pathways are among the most
highly modulated in both analyses. In addition, molecules with known patterns of regulation (e.g., CRH in
normal pregnancy; leptin and sFlt-1 in PE), were expressed in the expected manner, data that strengthen the
importance of our novel findings. Accordingly, we now propose using a microarray approach to analyze the
effects of PE on CTB invasion. Specifically, we will isolate the progenitors from affected and control
placentas and compare their patterns of gene expression as they differentiate/invade in vitro (Aim 1). Then
we will determine the functional significance of the changes we observe (Aim 2). We think that these
experiments will yield fundamental new insights into the basic placental defects that lead to PE. Additionally"",
the results could also have clinical utility in prediction and/or diagnosis of this pregnancy complication, with
the identification of potential therapeutic targets another possibility."," ",

About 90% of progeria patients die at an early age from progressive arteriosclerosis. HGPS is caused by mutations in human lamin A (hLA), a protein component of the nuclear lamina. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to determine the molecular basis by which mutations in the hLA gene alter nuclear function to cause these premature aging defects. It is our hypothesis that nucleoplasmic lamin structures, in addition to those in the lamina, form a nucleoskeletal system that provides the infrastructure required for crucial nuclear functions, including DNA replication, transcription, chromatin organization, nucleocytoplasmic transport and nuclear disassembly, assembly and shape. Understanding how these functions are altered by HGPS mutations will shed light on the mechanisms responsible for the multiple age-related disorders seen in patients with progeria, including cardiomyopathies and strokes. To this end, two laboratories with considerable expertise in lamin genetics, structure, function and nuclear transport will collaborate to address the following specific aims: 1) Characterize the effects of HGPS hLA mutations on nuclear structure and organization by the coordinated use of biochemical and microscopic methods. 2) Characterize the effects of HGPS hLA mutations on nuclear functions: DNA replication and cell division  using HGPS patient cells and cell-free preparations of Xenopus nuclei. 3) Characterize the effects of HGPS hLA mutations on nuclear functions: nuclear import and export, nuclear pore complex structure and nuclear envelope permeability. 4) The use of human and animal cell models to test the effects of hLA mutations on mesenchymal cell types most affected in HGPS. These collective studies will provide important insights into how hLA mutations cause the defects seen in progeria.","274593",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Our long-term objectives are to determine the basic mechanisms controlling branching morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation in prostate gland, i. e. to understand how growth control and cell differentiation are correlated during normal organogenesis, and what may be the weak links contributing to innate or acquired glandular pathologies, in particular benign and malignant prostate tumors. Towards this aim the goals of the present proposal are to explore the role of Notch signaling in normal prostate organogenesis: in prostate branching morphogenesis, in defining the epithelial prebud sites; and in cell fate choice, in epithelial differentiation, progenitor cell maintenance and proliferation. In the first specific aim, we will investigate the expression and activity of Notch pathway genes during embryonic and postnatal development of mouse prostate. In specific aims two, developmental regulation of Notch pathway by mesenchymal signaling factors will will be explored in vivo, in prostates from Bmp7 and Gli3 mutant mouse, and in organ culture. In specific aim four, we will assess the effect of gain of Notch function and inhibition of Notch function in epithelial proliferation, morphogenesis and differentiation vie retroviral infections, antisense oligonucleotide assays, and analysis of Hes knockout prostates. Results of this work will aid towards greater understanding of branching morphogenesis and differentiation of prostate and other glandular organs, such as mammary gland and lungs, and lead towards further insight on how benign and malignant epithelial tumors may arise and overcome the tissue specific growth restrictions. In perspective, those results may aid towards novel therapies to overcome genetic or injury inflicted pathologies in branched glands.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  MM is characterized by widespread disease at diagnosis with the presence of multiple lytic lesions and disseminated involvement of the bone marrow (BM), implying that the progression of MM involves a continuous circulation of the MM cells in the peripheral blood and re-entrance into the BM.  Chemokines play a central role in lymphocyte trafficking and homing, specifically the chemokine SDF-1, and its receptors, CXCR4 along with the recently identified receptor CXCR7.  We hypothesize that modulation of the capacity of MM cells to reside in their microenvironment will change their biologic properties and induce sensitivity to apoptosis.  Specific Aim 1: To identify mechanisms of homing of MM cells in response to the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis.  We will test this aim by determining the long-term biological sequelae of inhibition of SDF-1-dependent homing of MM and its effect on tumor progression, determining the differences in kinetics of homing between MM cells and other BM microenvironment cells, identifying the downstream signaling pathways that regulate MM cells' homing in response to CXCR4 and CXCR7 in vitro and in vivo, and difference in signaling of these two receptors in MM, and identifying the role of other chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules in the regulation of homing.  Specific Aim 2: To determine the in vitro and in vivo effects of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis on adhesion and survival of MM cells by identifying the biological changes that occur in MM cells adherent to the BM microenvironment compared to those in the peripheral blood, identifying the interaction of SDF-1/CXCR4 with adhesion molecules namely VLA-4 and LFA-1, and identifying the effect of inhibition of CXCR4/CXCR7 and/or adhesion molecules on growth and survival of MM cells in vivo.  Specific Aim 3: To identify mechanisms of egression/mobilization of MM cells in response to CXCR4/CXCR7 inhibition by determining the biological sequelae of mobilization of MM cells in response to inhibition of CXCR4, CXCR7, VLA-4 and MMP2/9 inhibitors, determining the difference in kinetics of mobilization of MM cells compared to other bone marrow cells, and determining whether MM cells mobilized out of the BM will be more sensitive to apoptosis by cytotoxic agents compared to malignant cells residing in the BM.  Targeting trafficking will lead to a paradigm shift in therapeutic approaches in MM, where we will alter the capacity of MM cells to reside in their protective bone marrow microenvironment by inducing egression and preventing homing and adhesion, leading to increased sensitivity to apoptosis.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The mechanisms of tumor progression in myeloma are not well understood.  We will study the role of the chemokine SDF-1 and its receptors in the regulation of entry of myeloma cells into the bone marrow, their adhesion and their exit into the circulation.  Targeting this process by mobilizing myeloma cells out of the marrow will lead to a higher sensitivity to killing of the cells with cytotoxic agents.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this competing renewal, we propose to continue our research on the role of Runx2 in tooth development. Data from our work in the previous award period indicated key roles for Runx2 in directing the fate of Dental epithelium during morphogenesis and in controlling the onset of odontoblast differentiation. Our studies point to the critical need to learn how Runx2 activities are precisely regulated during tooth morphogenesis and cell differentiation and whether its role in these processes is modulated through interactions with other molecules. The nuclear protein Twist-1 is of particular interest as a regulatory protein partner for Runx2. Our rationale for studying if Runx2, a cell differentiation factor, interacts with Twist-1, a cell survival factor, is derived from studies in our and other laboratories that suggest that these interactions between Runx2 and Twist-1 occur at the protein level. Our experiments will directly test the hypothesis that Runx2's key functions in odontoblast differentiation are regulated by Twist-1 at the level of protein- protein interactions that are functionally antagonistic in nature. The selective and transient blocking of Runx2 function by Twist-1 provides a means to restrain odontoblast differentiation until morphogenesis is complete. We further propose that interactions between Runx2 and Twist-1 are not mutually antagonistic as Twist-1 can mediate cell proliferation during morphogenesis via FGF-mediated epithelial mesenchymal signaling. Hence, the presence of supernumerary teeth in human CCD and accessory buds in Runx2(-/-) mice likely reflect increased activity of Twist-1 rather than a direct effect of decreased levels of Runx2. Aim 1 will determine if the patterns of Runx2 and Twist-1 (mRNA and protein) expression are compatible with their proposed partnership during tooth development and will correlate these patterns with the expression of molecular markers of tooth morphogenesis and odontoblast differentiation. Aim 2 will assess with mouse genetic loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches whether alterations in Twist-1 expression affects tooth morphogenesis and odontoblast differentiation. Aim 3 will study the molecular basis of Runx2 - Twist-1 protein interactions in Dental mesenchyme and the functional consequences of this interaction on Runx2 functions in odontoblast differentiation, and Aim 4 will test whether the bHLH domain of Twist-1 can mediate tooth morphogenesis via FGF-signaling that is independent of its interactions with Runx2. These studies will increase our understanding of how Runx2 achieves its selective functions in tooth development through its partnership with Twist-1. Importantly, they will explain how supernumerary teeth form and if odontoblast differentiation is determined by the release of an inhibition. Such data will also provide a framework for understanding the pathogenesis of Cleidocranial Dysplasia and Saethre-Chotzen Syndrome, 2 human genetic disorders that threaten dentition.

A project aimed at distinguish among several auto-inflammatory diseases with various degrees of systemic inflammation, including CAPS (Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes), HIDS (hyper-immunoglobulin D (IgD) syndrome), and TRAPS (Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome), and to identify disease associated genes. This should be achieved by developing a systems biology based approach that identifies transcription factors potentially involved in signal transduction of Pyrin, the key gene that causes Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Furthermore, a possible way to dissect inflammatory and chemotactic pathways in FMF and to identify gene-expression signatures in peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with TRAPS using microarray profiling is investigated.

As an integral part of a research project, BMDs involvement can be generally described as follows: 
	design and implement statistical data analysis strategies
	perform data analysis
	discuss data analysis strategy and analysis results with other project team members
	train researchers such as post-docs for special bioinformatics approaches
	help with interpretation of analysis results obtained by other project team members
	design, develop, and implement special computer programs required by a project
	evaluate and implement special computer software in the public domain as needed by a project
	design and create special figures for research publication

Our IRP made a strategic investmen with the Illuminas NGS (next generation sequencing) Genome Analyzer in October, 2007, which requires dedicated bioinformatics support in analyzing the gigantic amount of data this cutting-edge instrument produces (one experiment run produces about one Terabyte of data and analysis results). As a result, BMD transitioned itself accordingly, focusing now on providing bioinformatics support to Genome Analyzer data based research projects.

Development of specific data analysis approaches

Creation and application of multiple predictive LDA models using microarray data from patients with inflammatory diseases

Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a statistical and machine learning method used to identify the linear combination of variables that best separates two or more classes, was used to build multiple predictive classifiers. Classifier genes were selected with forward selection, a data-driven model building approach in which orthogonal variables are sequentially added to a model until certain criteria are satisfied. The total number of genes allowed in a classifier was limited to the number of samples in the smallest group to prevent over-fitting. Genes already selected to build a model were removed from the gene pool and the process was repeated to create multiple predictive classifiers of satisfactory quality. Each model is validated with a real leave-one-out cross validation approach, in which a model was completely rebuilt without the removed sample. This whole model building process allowed identification of multiple predictive gene sets. The predictive models are further validated by applying them to an independent data set using a simple voting scheme.

This approach has been successfully applied to several translational research projects involving patients of NOMID (Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease), HIDS (hyper-immunoglobulin D (IgD) syndrome), and TRAPS (Tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome). For NOMID project, the specificity and sensitivity of the predictive models are close to 90%.

A systems biology based approach to identify transcription factors potentially involved in specific signal transduction

Genes co-regulated by a transcription factor are expected to carry the corresponding TF binding site in their promoters (shared promoter). This approach starts with a set of user defined genes from microarray or other experiments. Promoter analysis is then performed to identify statistically enriched and commonly shared transcription factor binding sites. Due to the relaxed nature of all TF family binding sites, the existence of a shared TF family binding site, even statistically significant, does not necessarily mean it is functional. It is thus critically important that other lines of evidence be obtained to support and confirm a functional TF binding site. One such piece of evidence, although indirect, may come from the observation that specific TFs corresponding to the shared binding sites are themselves significantly regulated. Results of expression data analysis together with those of promoter analysis thus will point to potential transcription factors that may be involved in regulating the functions of the genes under investigation.
This approach has been successfully applied to the project of RNA interference of MEFV in THP.1 cells, where interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) has been identified as a potential mediator of Pyrin.

Illumina only provides a general-purpose pipeline software for image analysis, base calling, and sequence alignment of the data produced by its Genome Analyzer. And there is no commercial software available for analysis beyond sequence because the Genome Analyzer is so new to the market. customized home-made computer programs developed to satisfy very specific research needs. BMD met the challenge with the development and implementation of some python programs.","292704",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Pax2 gene is an essential regulator of early renal development and has also been implicated in a variety of human diseases both congenital and acquired. During embryonic development, Pax2 is required for the initiation and maintenance of the conversion of the renal mesenchyme to epithelium. Its presence is also required to activate GDNF and thus ureteric bud outgrowth. Pax2 expression is turned off as the glomerular, proximal, and distal tubular epithelium matures. Loss of Pax2 expression leads to an absence of kidneys in the mouse knockout, while partial loss (heterozygosity) leads to the RenaI-Coloboma syndrome in humans. Persistent expression of Pax2 is found in human and mouse PKD, dysplastic and cystic disease and also is associated with renal cell carcinoma and the Wilms Tumor. Although Pax2 is presumed to be a DNA binding transcription factor, the biochemical mechanisms of Pax2 function remain obscure. In order to understand how Pax2 expression directs early epithelial differentiation and proliferation, it is essential to identify the genes activated or repressed by the Pax2 protein. This proposal aims to identify gene targets of Pax2 using a differential screening method in cell culture. We have derived cell lines from embryonic kidney mesenchyme that exhibit altered gene expression patterns when transformed with Pax2 expressing retroviruses. Genes activated in response to Pax2 were identified using a combination differential subtraction and suppressive PCR strategy. One clone has been confirmed as a kidney specific target of Pax2 and several others will be confirmed by a variety of methods. Candidate target clones in our differential screen will be assayed for kidney specific expression during development by whole mount and conventional in situ hybridization. Direct binding of Pax2 to genomic loci will be assayed and the ability of Pax2 to transactivate transcription of reporter genes, using upstream regulatory elements from candidate targets, will be determined. The effect of Pax2 phophorylation status on target gene activation will also be examined utilizing Pax2 proteins mutated in presumed phosphorylation sites in the transactivation region. How Pax2 can alter or remodel the chromatin structure of candidate target loci will begin to be addressed. Initial experiments will focus on the DNAsel sensitivity of candidate target genes and the methylation state, two structural features known to potentiate gene expression. Further experiments will focus on target gene association with nuclear matrix, which also is known to provide a change from random to specific anchorage points when chromatin becomes active. This proposal will provide critical new data for understanding the early events underlying renal epithelial differentiation and growth. As such, it may provide novel insight into the mechanisms controlling the normal differentiation and proliferation of epithelium as well as those involved in both congenital and acquired human disease processes.

Using our mouse experimental autoimmune diabetes (EAD) model system, we have designed an in vivo assay to test if stem cells can efficiently generate and maintain beta cells during an ongoing autoimmune response.  Specific features of the model include: (i) normal host metabolism is maintained for an extended time followed by (ii) gradually declining pancreatic islet function creating a need for new beta cells, (iii) intra-islet inflammation which may provide critical cues for regulated stem cell migration to the pancreas and differentiation into beta cells, and (iv) newly developed, stem cell-derived beta cells are resistant to autoantigen-specific T cell mediated attack.  Using this system, we tested crude preparations of hematopoetic stem cells (HSC) reported by some to contain cells capable of transdifferentiating into pancreatic beta cells. We found that the HSC had no functionally relevant capacity to form beta cells in vivo. Using the model, we thoroughly evaluated and experimentally ruled out several critical questions such as whether the failure to generate insulin producing beta cells in vivo might have been due to the inability of newly developed beta cells to withstand the toxicity of an inflammatory environment typically associated with immune-mediated pancreatic islet destruction.  Data weve generated strongly support the claim that newly generated beta cells from the bone marrow donor origin would be protected from immune mediated attack, by confirming the selective survival of donor-derived pancreatic islets (stem-cell genotype) over host-type islets during rejection of mixed islet transplants. As a positive control for this model, we've shown that single cells isolated from embryonic mouse pancreata, then injected into the adult mouse pancreas, will differentiate into mature islets.  More specifically, using mice provided by Dr. Manami Hari (University of Chicago) in which beta cell expression of green fluorescent protein is driven by the mouse insulin promoter, we've shown that a single cell suspension of day e14.5 pancreatic bud cells can be injected into the pancreas of adult syngeneic mice and that committed progenitor cells from the embryonic mouse pancreas will differentiate in the adult mouse pancreas into mature appearing islets.  Moreover, the islets differentiating from the embryonic donors are clearly differentiated by their green color.  These data have been submitted for publication. In related work, Dr. Pechhold demonstrated with collaborators using cell labeling techniques that islet beta cells do not efficiently de-differentiate into rapidly proliferating cells (so called epithelial to mesenchymal transition) that can then be re-differentiated into insulin producing cells in vitro.

We have also demonstrated and reported that a gene-therapy approach described by others as efficiently promoting transdifferentiation, i.e. converting liver cells into insulin producing cells, was in fact very inefficient.  Our published studies suggested that mouse liver Pdx-1 expression driven by adenoviral vectors generated less hepatic insulin production than 16 islets, an amount clearly insufficient to maintain glucose homeostasis.

Last, in view of our promising model system for identifying putative islet progenitor cells, we have been joined by a professor from Brazil who elected to spend his sabbatical year with us further develop and characterize the system, and to identify the pancreatic islet progenitor cell.","217527",

Unlike peripheral cells which may be infected with viruses, the immune system has developed cell-sparing mechanisms of eliminating virus growth. These studies are directed at understanding host cytokine responses which regulate the replication of virus in neurons. 
In this competing renewal, Aims 1 and 2 are focused on the sensitization of neurons by type 1 interferon (IFN-beta). We will determine the cellular pathways which are activated and are able to effect an inhibitory role on the viral life cycle of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV); preliminary data show that these are distinct from that used by IFN-gamma. In most cell types, RNA viruses readily induce the production of IFN-beta during their replication, which includes double stranded RNA intermediates. However, in our preliminary studies, VSV is an exception, and no IFN-beta was detected during infection both in vivo and in vitro. We will characterize the means by which VSV prevents neuronal synthesis of IFN-beta which could protect neighboring cells. We will determine the mechanism of peripheral induction of IFN-beta gene expression at 24h post intranasal infection, and examine the role of Toll Like Receptors (TLR) in the responses both of neurons and of splenocytes; we will determine if PDC are responsible for IFN-beta synthesis. Aim 3 will continue our studies on the antiviral effector which is induced by type 2 IFN (IFN-gamma) nitric oxide (NO); we have shown that mRNA for NOS-1, the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase, does not change in cells treated with IFN-gamma, but the amount of the enzyme increases as does its activity. Studies are designed to define the novel mechanism of the increase in the enzyme which is induced by treatment of neurons with IFN-gamma. In aim 4, we will elucidate the mechanism by which this small molecule, NO, is able to inhibit viral protein synthesis and release of infectious virions from neurons. 
These studies are important because the insights gained will be beneficial in developing new and novel treatments for viral encephalitis considered new and emerging infections. They elucidate previously unsuspected interactions between the immune system and the central nervous system.","28968",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Project Summary:  
Our studies and others have shown that cellular differentiation is inhibited under hypoxic conditions. In some stem cell compartments, such as the bone marrow, the physiological level of oxygenation is much lower than in other tissues under normal physiological conditions, suggesting that hypoxia may play an important role in the regulation of stem cell maintenance and differentiation. However, the role of hypoxia in the regulation of stem cell maintenance still remains unidentified. I propose to investigate the mechanisms by which hypoxia maintains stemnness and regulates other stem cell functions. I am trained as a cancer biologist and have been studying the biology of tumor hypoxia. I was among the first to investigate the role of the hypoxia signaling pathway in the regulation of cellular differentiation. I wish to use my expertise in hypoxia biology to study the maintenance of stem cells by their microenvironment and eventually to extend my career into stem cell research. To achieve this goal, I will first receive training in stem cell research under the tutelage of Dr. Diane Krause, a leading expert in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) biology. During the K18 Award period, I will learn the basics of HSC and progenitor cell biology and master all of the key techniques while I investigate the role of hypoxia in the maintenance and homing of HSCs. After the training, will continue collaboration with Dr. Krause and other stem cell experts to delineate mechanisms underlying how hypoxia may act to regulated HSCs. I will use the knowledge gained to investigate the role of hypoxia in the regulation of other adult and/or embryonal stem cells. I also wish to develop new technologies for long term maintenance of stem cells in vitro for clinical applications. Yale University has created an excellent environment for stem cell research, and I look forward to becoming a part of Yale's rapidly growing Stem Cell Program. The overall environment is excellent for my training and career development.  
Relevance to public health: This research could lead to improved methods for the ex vivo growth and maintenance of HSCs long term and thus could facilitate the use of HSCs in stem cell therapies for cancers and other genetic diseases. In addition, discoveries regarding the in vivo microenvironment for HSCs could lead to improved engraftment following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Our preliminary data suggest that a unique mesenchymal cell population derived from paraxial mesoderm selectively surrounds the distal UB and secretes factors such as Bone Morphogenetic Factor 4 that are required for patterning the ureter. Specifically, we propose that BMP4 controls ureter structure by activating an antagonist of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling which is known to induce branching morphogenesis. In addition, we show that Bone Morphogenetic Protein 5, another factor secreted by periureteral mesenchyme, induces UB epithelia to terminally differentiate. The aims of this proposal will test these hypotheses describing the molecular mechanisms controlling ureter morphogenesis using established fate mapping, tissue removal, immunohistochemical, morphological, and transgenic techniques. Aim 1) The differentiated fate of ureteral connective tissue cells derived from paraxial mesoderm will be determined and ureter morphogenesis in the absence of these cells analyzed. Aim 2) The expression of membrane-associated Sprouty 1, an active receptor tyrosine kinase antagonist, will be correlated with sites of BMP signaling in the developing ureter. Ureter structure and the cellular distribution of Sprouty 1 will be analyzed in the developing mouse in the absence of BMP signaling. Aim 3) Terminal urothelial cell differentiation will be analyzed in vitro and in vivo in the absence of BMP5 signaling and in the presence of ectopic BMP signaling. Results of proposed experiments will provide much needed insight into the signaling pathways mediating ureter morphogenesis, a process that is prone to abnormalities in humans.","429734",

Our preliminary studies indicate that the paired related homeobox gene, Prxl, is required for lung vascularization via its ability to promote both endothelial cell (EC) differentiation and vascular network formation. The Specific Aims of this proposal are as follows: (1) To define how Prxl drives EC differentiation during lung vasculogenesis: Tie-GFP transgenic mice will be used to locate Prxl-expressing ECs throughout lung development, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays will be used to identify direct targets for Prxl in differentiating lung ECs. The validity and functions of Prxl and its targets will be evaluated using Prxl-null mice and tissue culture models of pulmonary EC differentiation; (2) To determine how Prxl-dependent induction of the extracellular matrix protein tenascin- C (TN-C) promotes lung vascular network formation: Knockout studies using fetal lung explants, yeast 2- hybrid assays and tissue recombinations will be used to understand how TN-C promotes Prxl-dependent network formation; (3) To delineate how focal adhesion kinase (FAK) controls Prxl during vascular network formation: Adenoviral-based inhibition of FAK activity, and dissection of the Prxl gene promoter will be used to comprehend how FAK controls Prxl transcription and vascular morphogenesis in the lung. 
Overall, this proposal will result in a detailed understanding of the role of Prxl throughout fetal lung vascularization. This study should provide new concepts in lung vascular biology, and will hopefully result in novel diagnostic tools and therapies for the treatment of newborn and adult diseases in which the pulmonary vasculature is compromised, eg. bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension.","373346",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Obesity is a public health problem worldwide, which results from an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. Adipose tissues play an important role in regulation of energy balance. Two functionally different types of fat tissue are present in mammals: white adipose tissue is the primary site of triglyceride storage and release of fatty acids, and brown adipose tissue is specialized for energy expenditure via thermogenesis. The long-term goal is to determine factors that underlie the divergent differentiation fates and functions of these two adipose cell types. These factors may contribute to regulation of whole-body energy balance and development of obesity. Our preliminary studies have suggested an important role for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7 in regulation of brown adipogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis. Based on these findings and previous knowledge of the effects of BMPs on white adipocyte differentiation, we hypothesize that different members of the BMP family play crucial roles in determining the differential developmental fate of brown vs. white adipose tissue, modulating thermogenic function in these cells, and thereby contributing to regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis. The proposed studies will determine the molecular mechanisms by which BMPs influence adipose cell fate determination, adipocyte differentiation and mitochondrial activity in both in vitro and in vivo settings. The specific aims are to:  
(1) Define the role of BMP-7 in specifying brown adipose cell fate and modulating thermogenic function in committed brown and white preadipocytes, pluripotent mesenchymal cells, sorted primary adipose progenitors and human preadipocytes. (2) Dissect the molecular mechanisms by which different BMPs, particularly BMP-7, regulate brown vs. white adipogenesis and mitochondrial function. (3) Define the in vivo role of BMPs in regulation of adipocyte differentiation, mitochondrial function and whole-body energy balance by treatment of lean and obese mice with BMPs and characterization of their effects on adipose physiology and whole-body energy metabolism. The developmental role of BMP signaling in fat development will be further investigated by characterization of constitutive and inducible adipose-specific BMP receptor knockout mice. These studies will increase our understanding of adipocyte differentiation, energy balance, and BMP actions, and may help to develop potential therapeutic approaches for obesity and related diseases.

For more than a decade, adenovirus (Ad) serotype 5-based vectors have been used in gene therapy, with limited success. The main disadvantages of Ad5-based vectors appear to be preexisting immunity in the majority of humans, low transduction of important gene therapy target cells (due to low expression of the primary Ad5 receptor, CAR), and innate toxicity induced upon intravascular application (in part due to uptake by cells of the reticuloendothelial system, particularly Kupffer cells). Recent data indicate that vectors containing fibers from Ad group B serotypes 11 and 35 recognize cellular receptors different from CAR and efficiently transduce human cell types that are relatively refractory to Ad5 infection, including malignant tumor cells, bone marrow derived hematopoietic stem cells, mesenchymal cells, and dendritic cells. Furthermore, we found that intravenously injected vectors containing B-group Ad35 or Ad 1 fibers only inefficiently transduce Kupffer cells and therefore elicit significantly reduced innate toxicity as compared to Ad5 vectors. However, little is known about mechanisms and effects of B-group Ad vector infection in vitro and in vivo. Before a clinical application of these new vectors can be considered, this knowledge gap has to be filled. Therefore, the central goal of this proposal is to study the efficiency, specificity, and safety of B-group Ad vector infection on the cellular and organism levels. We will first delineate the cellular receptors involved in B-group Ad infection and construct a set of reporter vectors containing fibers from representative B-group Ad serotypes that differ in the usage of cellular receptors. To study the effects of Ad infection on cell biology (including signaling and changes in gene expression), we will focus on human cell cultures that express B- group Ad receptors and are relevant targets for ex vivo gene therapy. Then, upon in vivo application, we will study the biodistribution of B-group Ad vectors and monitor blood parameters, histopathology, cytokine production/release, and anti-vector immune responses. These studies will be performed in transgenic mice that express B-group Ad receptors. Based on this, we will select representative vectors and parameters and repeat biodistribution and safety studies in baboons.","283183",

Matrix
GLA protein (MGP) is an alleged calcification inhibitor that is up-regulated in atherosclerotic lesions. Deletion
of the MGP gene results in arterial calcification and in morphological abnormalities in mice and humans.
MGP is a secreted protein that is modified by vitamin K-dependent g-carboxylation. When isolated from
bone, it is processed and lacks seven C-terminal amino acids.
The mechanism of MGP is poorly understood. However, our experimental data points to a role in
transforming growth factor-fi (TGF-fi) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. The data suggest a
potential link between BMP and TGF-li in that BMP2 and BMP-4 induce expression of the TGF-R, receptor
Activin-like Kinase receptor 1 (ALK1). Signaling through ALK1 induces MGP, which provides negative
feedback regulation for BMP. Interactions between MGP and specific receptors were also observed.
Three hypotheses will be tested in this grant. The first hypothesis is that MGP regulates TGF-fi and BMP
signaling at the receptor level, resulting in altered SMAD signaling and gene expression. We will characterize
activation of SMAD signaling and relevant reporter genes induced by TGF-li1, BMP-2 and BMP-4 in
presence of MGP, and identify the TGF-li / BMP receptors that are regulated by MGP. The second
hypothesis is that MGP participates in specific protein-protein interactions that may be altered by C-terminal
processing. We will characterize the interactions, which include the TGF-ft receptors, using specific
immunoprecipitations in combination with a general proteomic approach. The third hypothesis is that MGP
functions as a BMP inhibitor in developing arteries and in atherosclerotic lesions. We will generate a
transgenic mouse for targeted, conditional expression of the BMP-inhibitor Noggin. Noggin expression will be
induced in MGP null mice in attempt to replace MGP and abolish calcification. The effect of Noggin will also
be determined in atherosclerotic lesions in LDL-receptor null mice.
Our results will add insight to calcification of vessels and heart valves, a common problem in heart disease.
In addition, it may provide information on how to design new treatments for unwanted calcification.","375049",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the tissue interactions and molecular mechanism underlying induction, patterning and cell fate specification in the vertebrate middle ear. This study examines the tissue interactions and functional mechanisms involved in induction and morphogenesis of the vertebrate middle ear. The ear has multiple components that need to develop and interact correctly for normal hearing. Because the interactions are so complex, there are multiple ways that developmental defects occur through development. As a result of developmental (congenital) defects in a complex system such as the hearing apparatus, hearing loss is one of the most common birth defects (1 in 300-500 newborns affected), with about 10% conductive hearing loss. Middle and outer ear congenital and later anomalies resulting in conductive hearing loss include, microtia, atresia, cholesteatoma, exostoses, otoschlerosis, glomus tumor, myringosclerosis of the tympanic membrane, otitis media and trauma. The morphology of the chick middle ear was described nearly 30 years ago, but few studies of the tissue and molecular interactions required for initiation and patterning of the middle ear using modern molecular methods have been undertaken. Using the chicken embryo, with its numerous advantages as a model organism, crucial studies of both tissue interactions and signaling mechanisms can be accomplished. The chick offers a simple, accessible system in which a single bone, the columella develops, which is essential for sound transmission. Tissue interactions and signaling pathways from other complex mechanisms within the embryo, implicate gene candidates for a role in middle ear development. Signaling pathways have also been implicated by their expression patterns in the right place and at the right time. Gene expression in the chick can be altered by several means and has a high degree of spatial and temporal precision. We aim 1) to determine the gene expression profile of the columella condensation, replacement and persistent cartilage, and timing of chondrogenesis and ossification of the columella using histology and in situ hybridization analysis, 2) determine if the pharyngeal endoderm, lying adjacent to the site of columella condensation is crucial for induction of the columella condensation by performing tissue manipulation and recombination experiments and 3) manipulate the Fgf and Wnt signaling pathways to determine their role in induction and later development of the columella.

In order to facilitate recruitment of the
microvasculature and migration of tumor cells extracellular matrix¿(ECM) must undergo extensive
remodelling. The molecular mechanisms that mediate controlled regulation of ECM turnover in quiescent
stroma and are responsible for dysregulation of this process during tumorigenesis are not well defined. There
is growing evidence, including recent studies from our laboratory, that the members of the Ets family, Flil and
Etsl, are the critical regulators of stromal homeostasis in healthy tissues, as well as contributors to formation
of reactive stroma. We hypothesize that Fli1 is involved in maintaining quiescent stroma, which facilitates
proper interactions between endothelial and perivascular cells in healthytissue blood vessels. Downregulation
of Flil and upregulation of Etsl contributes to neoangiogenesis in breast tumors. Specifically, we hypothesize
that the primary role of Ets factors as integrators of the TGF-P/CTGF and Ras-MAPK signalling pathways is
in regulation of ECM remodeling. This in turn affects cell migration, cell survival, and recruitment of
perivascular cells to the newly formed vessels. To test these hypotheses we propose three Specific Aims. In
Aim 1 we will determine the possible role of Flil and Etsl in apoptosis of human microvascular endothelial
cells (HVMECs). In Aim 2 we will employ an in vitro organotypic coculture of HVMECs and breast
fibroblasts to investigate the roles of Etsl and Flil in capillary network formation. Specifically, the influence
of TGF-p, CTGF, and tumor-derived factors will be examined using this 3D model. In Aim 3 we will
determine the role of Flil in Neu-induced mammary tumorigenesis using various genetic models with altered
Flil expression. These will include an existing Flil+/- mice and conditional tissue-specific Flil deletion
mutants in fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which will be generated in this project. The results obtained in 3D
coculture experiments and in animal models in vivo will be validated using tissue from patients with breast
cancer."," ",

discovered that the canonical WNT/beta-catenin intercellular signaling pathway is required for initiating the
formation of all types of hair follicle placodes during embryogenesis, and is essential postnatally for hair
growth. These findings have potential significance for the development of strategies for regenerating hair
follicles in cases of congenital absence or loss, and for the treatment of hair growth disorders. However, as
activating mutations in beta-catenin can cause hair follicle tumors, it will be of critical importance to delineate
the precise mechanisms by which WNT/beta-catenin signals normally initiate hair follicle development and
regulate postnatal hair growth, and to identify the WNT ligands that control normal development and growth.
To these ends we will test the hypothesis that WNT/beta-catenin signaling initiates hair follicle
morphogenesis by direct activation of genes of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF receptor familes.
We will manipulate WNT/beta-catenin signaling in inducible transgenic mouse models to determine the
requirement for this pathway for the onset and maintenance of the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle,
and we will examine the skin phenotypes of mice mutant for two hair follicle-expressed Wnt genes.
Unexpectedly, we discovered that expression of Frizzled WNT receptors in developing and postnatal skin is
not confined to sites of known activity of the WNT/beta-catenin pathway, suggesting that WNT signaling
through alternate pathways may contribute to the development and maintenance of the skin and hair
follicles. Non-canonical WNT signaling regulates the planar cell polarity of epithelial cells and cell
movements in vertebrate embryos. We will test the hypothesis that non-canonical WNT signaling is
important for cell movements and polarity in skin epithelia by depleting the function of a key non-canonical
WNT signaling pathway component in mouse skin in vivo and in cultured keratinocyes.","329723",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/MAP kinase pathway is a major control point for mesenchymal differentiation. In bone, this pathway is a major conduit for conveying information about the extracellular environment to the nucleus and has been implicated in the response of bone to a variety of signals including cell adhesion, hormone/growth factor stimulation and mechanical loading. As shown by this laboratory, ERK/MAPK signaling is necessary for osteoblast differentiation and in vivo skeletal development. Furthermore, actions of this pathway on osteoblast differentiation are mediated by phosphorylation and activation of the bone-related transcription factor, RUNX2, at 2 critical serine residues. Goals for this renewal are to understand how phosphorylation controls RUNX2 transcriptional activity and establish the physiological significance of MAPK signaling and RUNX2 phosphorylation during development and post-natal life. Aims are:   
1. Establish the importance of MAPK phosphorylation to the biological activity of RUNX2 in vitro and the underlying mechanism of transcriptional activation.   
2. Evaluate the role of the ERK/MAPK pathway in osteoblast/osteocyte function in adult mice.   
3. Evalulate the in vivo role of RUNX2 phosphorylation in skeletal development and homeostasis.   
   These studies will establish the significance of a novel pathway for controlling gene expression in bone. Mechanisms defined in this project have the potential to explain how bone responds to a number of primary extracellular stimuli including ECM and mechanical signals and may serve as the basis for new therapeutic approaches targeting MAPK signaling.7.

The clinical result, cirrhosis, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. It has recently been established that resident hepatic mesenchymal cells, termed perisinusoidal stellate cells (Ito cells or lipocytes), play a critical role in the hepatic wounding response. One of the key events in this process is the ""activation"" of stellate cells, resulting in increased extracellular matrix synthesis and de novo smooth muscle (-actin expression, and recently smooth muscle myosin isoforms. Expression of smooth muscle proteins in stellate cells has been coupled to their potential for enhanced contractility. Further, it is postulated that the highly contractile phenotype found in activated stellate cells has important physiologic effects in the injured liver by contributing to increased intrahepatic resistance to blood flow typical of portal hypertension and perhaps by physical distortion of the liver. In preliminary studies presented in this proposal, it is shown that smooth muscle g- actin directly mediates stellate cell contraction and that it plays an important physiologic role in mediating portal hypertension. Further, preliminary data presented in the application indicate that myosin motors are upregulated during the injury and activation process, providing a putative molecular mechanism for enhanced contractility characteristic of activated stellate cells. 
The overall aim of the proposal is therefore to understand the molecular basis for enhanced contractility typical of activated stellate cells and to determine whether interruption of this exaggerated contractile phenotype has effects on intrahepatic portal hypertension or the wound healing response itself. Toward this end, the application proposes to examine myosin II regulation and the myosin signaling pathway in normal and activated stellate cells Subsequent studies will explore mechanisms of smooth muscle protein (i.e., smooth muscle myosin and actin) regulation as well as the in vivo function of each of these proteins in the liver.

The proposed studies will shed light on the molecular basis of stellate cell contractility and moreover have direct relevance to human liver disease.","342836",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application represents a revised version of a competing renewal of a project focusing on the role of the Nf1 gene product neurofibromin during cardiac development. In humans, NF1 is mutated in patient with von Recklinghausen Neurofibromatosis, a disease characterized by benign and malignant tumors of neural crest origin. Nf1 knockout mice display enlarged endocardial cushions and succumb during mid-gestation with evidence of cardiovascular impairment. The cardiac defects include pulmonic stenosis, double outlet right ventricle and thinned myocardium, defects that are seen in other mouse and chick models of cardiac neural crest-related congenital heart disease. However, our recent studies demonstrate that neural crest migration and patterning in the heart is normal in Nf1-deficient embryos. Furthermore, inactivation of Nf1 in neural crest (using three distinct Cre mice) does not reproduce embryonic lethality or the cardiac phenotype of null embryos. Rather, these mice are born and display hyperplasia of numerous neural crest-derived structures including peripheral ganglia and the adrenal gland. Surprisingly, inactivation of Nf1 in endothelial cells using Tie2-Cre recapitulates the embryonic cardiac defects seen in Nf1 null embryos. These results establish a novel and unexpected role for neurofibromin in endothelium. Moreover, we have observed elevated levels of activated MAPK in endothelium of mutant embryos consistent with a role for Nf1 in down-regulating Ras activity. We also demonstrate enhanced nuclear localization of NFATc1 (a factor known to be required for endocardial cushion formation) in Nf1-null endocardium. Here, we propose to test the hypothesis that Nf1 deficiency in endothelial cells results in activation of Ras. We will examine downstream effectors of Ras signaling in endothelium. We will also examine the mechanism by which Ras activation modulates subsequent nuclear localization of NFATc1 and potentially Smads, and we will test the hypothesis that nuclear localization of NFATc1 is required for enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transformation in the endocardial cushions of Nf1-deficient mice using both genetic and biochemical approaches. We will examine the function of Nf1 in adult endothelial cells and in adult and embryonic smooth muscle with the use if inducible tissue-specific Cre mice.

Thus, novel molecular targets based on biological paradigms must be identified towards the elimination of such tumors.  At the microscopic level, slow growing, well to moderately differentiated tumors can be readily distinguished from fast growing, poorly differentiated tumors and are assigned different histologic grades.  However, the 'histogenetic evolution' of such differences remains elusive.  We propose to use a novel approach to test the hypothesis that histologic grade is the combined manifestation of global genetic changes in the 'initiated' breast epithelial cells and the ensuing 'cross talk' with the surrounding stroma during tumor progression.  A molecular road map supporting this model could assist in targeting tumors of all histologic grades.  A major difficulty in the pursuit of this goal is the lack of cellular models for experimental manipulation, which reflect the breadth of biological heterogeneity in breast cancer.  In our previous research, we designed and implemented strategies for establishing a comprehensive resource of live epithelial and stromal cultures from cancerous breast tissue.  Here, we will use this unique resource to: 1. determine grade-specific gene expression in matched tumor-derived cellular subsets, using cDNA microarrays. 2. simulate biological interactions between these subsets to study paracrine regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and response to anti-tumor agents. 3. analyze grade-specific gene function in representative cell cultures by exogenous transduction and silencing approaches. 4. evaluate temporal acquisition of grade-specific gene expression within the tumor and contiguous blocks of adjacent non-malignant tissue.  Completion of these studies will lead to an improved understanding of molecular signaling within and between cellular subsets resulting in primary breast tumors with varying degrees of histological and functional aggressiveness.","261573",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In response to injury, an evolutionarily conserved wound healing process occurs. This response, if gone awry, can result in a pathologic process known as fibrosis, which is due to abnormal accumulation of extra cellular matrix (ECM) and is responsible for causing structural alterations and loss of function of the involved organ. Hepatic fibrosis, if not checked, can progress into cirrhosis and cause irreversible damage to the liver. The main component of the ECM is type I collagen, which, in the case of hepatic fibrosis, is synthesized by the activated stellate cells of the liver. Upon activation, stellate cells become more active in that they are proliferative, contractile due to a -smooth muscle actin and synthesize increased amounts of type I collagen. In our laboratory we have developed a triplex-forming oligodeoxyribonueleotide (TFO), which forms a triple helix structure with the C1 region (-170 to -141) of the a1(I) collagen gene promoter and inhibits transcription. Further we have shown that this TFO inhibits liver fibrosis, induced by administration of the chemical, dimethyl-nitorosamine (DMN), in rats. Now we would like to develop this antigene TFO as a potential antifibrotic agent. We hypothesize that this TFO selectively inhibits collagen synthesis in activated stellate cells. In this proposal, we describe experiments to address the mechanism by which the TFO inhibits collagen gene transcription. Whether the TFO blocks transcription by forming triplexes or by blocking events that lead to inflammation and activation of stellate cells will be studied. Experiments to develop a most efficacious TFO and to study its toxicity, stability, and biodistribution have been proposed. Further, the uptake by different tissues in rats and by different cell types, such as hepatocytes, stellate and Kupffer cells of the liver will also be studied. In these studies we will be using histochemical methods to monitor fibrosis, immunohistochemical methods to examine toxicity and inflammation and various biochemical and nucleic acid hybridization techniques to quantitate the levels of collagen mRNA in the liver tissues. In addition, we will assay for liver function to assess the extent of damage to the liver by the DMN and prevention by the TFO. The data generated from this project may lead to Phase I trials in humans for the treatment of liver fibrosis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Shimamura is a pediatric infectious diseases specialist whose career goal is to establish a molecular and translational program in solid organ transplant infectious diseases, focusing upon viral infections in transplant recipients. She plans to pursue clinician-scientist training under the tutelage of Dr. William J. Britt, noted herpesvirologist, and Dr. Mark Benfield, transplant immunologist and national leader in pediatric renal transplant research. Formal molecular biology coursework and clinical transplant infectious diseases training outlined in this proposal will provide her with the educational foundation for future research in molecular virology, transplant infections, and patient-based translational research to determine causes and treatments for infections related to solid organ transplantation.  
  
Dr. Shimamura is based at the University of Alabama-Birmingham, which has a nationally recognized solid organ transplantation program. Dr. Shimamura studies human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), which has been linked epidemiologically to chronic renal allograft rejection and long-term graft loss, but the pathogenesis remains poorly understood. She has identified a novel mechanism by which HCMV may promote renal fibrosis via activation of transforming growth factor-¿1 (TGF-¿1), a potent pro-fibrotic cytokine found in renal allografts during chronic rejection. TGF-¿1 triggered matrix metalloprotease (MMP) production is also enhanced by HCMV infection of renal tubular cells. These data implicate a positive feedback loop between TGF-¿1, MMPs, and HCMV promoting fibrosis contributing to renal allograft dysfunction.  
  
This study will: (1) characterize the MMP-driven mechanism by which HCMV-infected cells activate TGF-¿1; (2) determine the HCMV gene(s) promoting TGF-¿1 activation; and (3) establish an in vivo murine model for CMV enhanced chronic renal allograft fibrosis. The long-term goal is to develop diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to prevent or abrogate CMV related renal fibrosis during chronic renal allograft rejection, thus preserving graft function in HCMV infected patients with chronic renal allograft rejection.  
  
Public Health Relevance: This research will provide insight into the molecular pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus contributions to renal fibrosis during chronic renal allograft rejection. Such studies will assist in development of new diagnostic strategies and treatments against chronic rejection to prevent long-term allograft loss in kidney transplant recipients, avoiding the cost and morbidity of long-term dialysis or re-transplantation in these patients.

As a pediatric surgeon, I have an intense interest in the management of intestinal failure in infants. The most common etiology of ""short-gut"" in infants is from necrotizing enterocolitis, but may also arise from volvulus, atresias, gastroschesis, and Hirschsprung's disease. Following massive intestinal loss, the remaining intestine attempts to adapt by enhancing proliferation of intestinal stem cells and their progeny resulting in marked increases in the remaining mucosal surface area aiding absorption and digestion. Failure of this process to adequately compensate require many children to depend on parenteral nutrition (TPN) to sustain adequate nutrition subjecting them to the many inherent risks of TPN, including cholestasis and liver failure. Developing new therapies to augment the adaptive response will require an understanding of the mechanisms that stimulate intestinal stem cells and their progeny following massive intestinal loss. My ongoing studies in the laboratory of Susan Henning Ph.D. are evaluating the role of secretory lineages during intestinal adapation, and have demonstrated an early increased production of intestinal secretory lineages occurs following resection. I hypothesize that the early increased production of intestinal secretory lineages following massive intestinal loss is essential to amplify the early signals initiating intestinal adaptation. This grant proposes the use of a specific progenitor assay somatic mutation (SPASM) sytem to identify dynamic changes within intestinal progenitor compartments that occur following a 50% intestinal resection in mice. The early role of secretory lineages initiating intestinal adaptation will further be evaluated by performing similar intestinal resections on mice harboring a mosiac inactivation of all secretory lineages in the terminal ileum and on normal mice following administration of growth factors that previously have been shown to stimulate only secretory or columnar lineages. The development of flow cytometry techniques to separate and quantitate epithelial lineages will provide an efficient tool to further assess the molecular mechanisms initiating the early adaptive response. The excellent environment provided by Dr. Henning's laboratory and the support of this application will provide a solid foundation for the development of an independent translational reseach career exploring the mechanisms of intestinal adaptation and treatment of intestinal failure in children.","129839",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alveolar macrophages have a fundamental role in regulating the innate host response in host defense against infection. However, there are also circumstances where chronic inflammation and fibrosis persist in the absence of infection. We have found that the extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) is a critical regulator of lung injury, inflammation and fibrosis. We have found that HA fragments mediate lung inflammation by interacting with Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 on macrophages to produce inflammatory chemokines in a manner that depends upon the intracellular adaptor protein MyD88. In addition, we have made the unexpected observation that high molecular mass HA on the cell surface of lung epithelial cells is protective against non-infectious lung injury in a TLR2/4/MyD88 manner that appears to involve the constitutive activation of NF-?B. These data suggest that the TLR2/4-MyD88 pathway is a critical regulator of non-infectious lung inflammation through distinct mechanisms on macrophages and epithelial cells. We have also made the observation that TLR4 is protective against lung fibrosis by a mechanism that may involve a MyD88-independent pathway. Collectively, these data have led us to the hypothesis that extracellular matrix has a fundamental role in regulating lung injury, inflammation and repair by distinct interactions with TLRs on infiltrating macrophages and parenchymal epithelial cells. We will test this hypothesis in the following Specific Aims: 1. Define the role of MyD88 signaling in lung epithelial cells and macrophages in regulating non- infectious lung injury and repair using gene targeted mice that only express MyD88 in either the lung epithelium or in tissue macrophages. 2. Characterize the mechanisms of exaggerated fibrogenesis in the absence of TLR4 signaling following non-infectious lung injury. 3. Define the mechanisms by which hyaluronan-TLR interactions maintain alveolar homeostasis in response to non-infectious lung injury. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. Chronic lung inflammation contributes to significant morbidity in lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, asthma and COPD. This grant proposal is to find to treatments for lung inflammation by understanding how injured lung tissue causes chronic lung inflammation.

Germany. The current postdoctoral fellowship research is conducted under supervision of Dr. Raghu Kalluri.
His laboratory is well suited to provide guidance in established and new molecular techniques and transgenic
animal studies to foster the start of an independent career. The research project proposed here centers on
exploring endogenus regenerative mechanisms, which facilitate protection from kidney injury and its use in
designing therapies to protect the kidney from chronic progressive kidney disease. The central hypothesis of
this proposal is that the recovery from renal injury follows pathways, which are similar to those, which
mediate kidney development. Such thinking is based on previous studies, which demonstrate that
administration of bone morphogenic protein-7 (BMP-7), a growth factor involved in tubulogenesis during
kidney development, facilitates regression of chronic kidney disease. These previous studies suggest that
BMP-7 may reverse epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) involving injured tubular epithelial cells,
leading to accumulation of fibroblasts. Additionally, BMP-7 also induces phenotypic changes in medullary
renal fibroblasts resembling mesenchymal to epithelial transition, regenrating epithelial cells. The study aims

support the hypothesis that epithelial cell autonomous TGF-15 signaling is tumor suppressive and
demonstrate that metastases can not only occur but are enhanced with knockout of the type II TGF-B
receptor (Tgfbr2) in mammary carcinoma cells. However, systemic inhibition of TGF-IS signaling markedly
suppressed pulmonary metastases in the MMTV-c-neu/DNIIR mice. This indicates that the effect of
systemic inhibitors of TGF-IS in suppressing metastasis is largely on host cells. These results have modified
our hypotheses concerning the mechanism of TGF-B promotion of tumor progression. We now propose that
tumor cell autonomous signaling by TGF-li can suppress rather than enhancing metastases, and that TGF-B
signaling in host cells is a significant component of both the tumor suppressive and the tumor promotion
effects of TGF-fi in vivo. We will test these hypotheses through the following specific aims by determining
the changes in the carcinoma cells and their microenvironment associated with knockout of the type II TGF-li
receptor gene, Tgfbr2, in tumor cells that lead to increased metastases. Specific Aim 1. Determine the
effects of systemic inhibition of TGF-IS signaling on mammary tumor formation and metastases from MMTV-
c-neu and MMTV-PyVmT-induced mammary tumors in the context Tgfbr2 knockout in mammary epithelial
cells effected by both MMTV-Cre and WAP-Cre. Specific Aim 2. Determine the influence of timing of loss of
TGF-B signaling during mammary tumor formation and progression on metastatic spread using inducible
MMTV-Cre. Specific Aim 3. Determine mechanisms for enhanced metastatic capability with loss of tumor
cell TGF-li signaling by examining both tumor cells and their microenvironment.","441398",

Upon disassembly of alpha6beta4 complexes in normal epithelia, the integrin engages in a new series of molecular interactions that promote epithelial cell invasion and tumorigenesis. Consistent with this, alpha6beta4 is upregulated during epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our preliminary data indicates that certain laminin-binding integrins, including alpha6beta4 are atypical among integrins insofar as being palmitoylated, and associating laterally with other transmembrane proteins, such as tetraspanin proteins. Furthermore, available data strongly supports our hypothesis that for the lamininbinding integrins, lateral associations with other proteins controls integrin-dependent adhesion strength, signaling, and cell morphology. To test this hypothesis, we will 1) make three different types of mutations in alpha6beta4 (palmitoylation sites, tetraspanin-association sites) to disrupt lateral associations.Then we will examine the effects of such mutations on 2) tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of alpha6beta4, and 3) signaling through phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt, Src-family kinases, and growth factor receptors. 4) Also we will examine mutation effects on cell adhesion, adhesion strength, motility, hemidesmosome formation, and acini formation in vitro, and 5) on spontaneous carcinoma formation in mice in vivo. Only recently have we begun to appreciate that integrins (particulary the laminin-binding integrins) can be regulated in the lateral dimension by specific interactions with other transmenbrane proteins, in the context of a novel type of membrane microdomain. The work proposed in this grant application will help to fill in important gaps in our knowledge regarding the contribution of integrin microdomains. Furthermore, we should gain new insights into alpha6beta4 as it plays such a pivotal role in the transition of normal epithelial cells from a stable, polarized state to an invasive carcinoma. Finally, our uncovering of specific alpha6beta4 domains and associated pathways that are critical during carcinogenesis may suggest novel targets for therapeutic intervention.","285031",

Skeletogenesis involves the coordinated process of patterning, cell fate commitment, differentiation, growth, and remodeling. RUNX2/CBFA1 is a transcription factor essential for osteoblast differentiation, chondrocyte hypertrophy, and tooth formation. However little is known about the regulation of RUNX2 expression, especially during chondrogenesis. We recently identified SOX9, a transcription factor essential for cartilage formation including cranial neural crest cell differentiation, as a potent transcription repressor for RUNX2 transactivation. We propose to utilize both in vivo and in vitro tools to further understand the interaction between SOX9 and RUNX2 during skeletongenesis, especially chondrocyte hypertrophy. We will use in situ hybridization technique to study in parallel the expression patterns of Sox9 and Runx2 during chondrogenesis. GST-pulldown experiments will be performed to examine whether SOX9 physically interacts with RUNX2. In tissue culture systems, we will over-express SOX9 or its repression domain in chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 and pluripotent mesenchymal precursor cell line C2C12 to determine whether they can disrupt chondrocyte hypertrophy and osteogenesis in vitro. SOX9 effects on Runx2 expression and its downstream genes will be analyzed by Northern analysis and enzymatic assays. We will also generate transgenic mice mis-expressing SOX9 in hypertrophic chondrocytes to determine the consequences in vivo on long bone growth. This study will help us understand how proper skeletal patterning and cell fate commitment are achieved.","100666",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Somitogenesis is a dynamic process that integrates global and local signaling with cell morphogenesis to produce an ordered array of metameric units, or somites, along the axis of vertebrate embryos. The goal of this project is to understanding how the read out of Notch, Fgf, Wnt and Retinoic acid pathways is combined to influence cell behavior mediated by protocadherins during somite boundary formation. A Xenopus explant system will be developed to visualize the behavior of cells within anterior or posterior somite compartments under normal and experimental conditions. The role of a novel protocadherin, paraxial protocadherin 2 (PAPC2), in establishing changes in cell-cell interactions at somite boundaries will be examined using this explant system. Finally, the enhancer regions controlling PAPC2 expression at forming somite boundaries will be isolated to further understand how input of signaling in the presomitic mesoderm positions expression of genes that act at boundary formation. Changes in protocadherin expression as well as misregulation of Wnt, Fgf, Notch, and Retinoic acid signaling pathways are seen during cancerous tumor growth and metastasis. Understanding the way these pathways are integrated during development to change cell behavior will provide strong experimental evidence for creating informed models that will help to elucidate the role of these signaling pathways in the progression of disease. Many ofthe genes that cause growth and establishment of tumors are also involved in the early development of embryos. Basic research into the ways cells use genes and the proteins they produce during development provides necessary tools for predicting how cancerous cells are using the same genes to establish tumors within specific tissues and to metastasize, releasing cells into the body that will invade new tissues. Ultimately, we hope to determine how genes are regulating cells' that are undergoing changes in adhesion during development and apply these findings to understanding the advanced stages of invasive forms of cancer. In solid tumors, certain proteins may cause cells to stick to one another, while in cases of metastasis, these same proteins may be lost from cells, allowing cells to migrate away from the site ofthe initial tumor. When cancerous cells invade new tissues, these adhesion proteins may be produced again and determine what type of tissues cancer cells can adhere to and form tumors in. By understanding how major gene pathways control adhesion in a developmental context, we will more fully understand how these genes control cell behavior during cancer establishment and progression.

cells persist despite intensive chemotherapy, leading to often fatal relapse. The hypothesis underlying the
research proposed is that immune cells, i.e., T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK)cells, redirected by
genetically-engineered (""chimeric"") antigen receptors can eradicate drug-resistant ALL. In preliminary
studies, receptors that recognize CD19 (a molecule highly expressed in ALL cells and absent in all normal
cells except B lymphocytes) deliver stimulatory signals to immune cells resulting in powerful cytotoxicity
against CD19+ALL cells.
Specific Aim 1 is to identify stimulatory signaling molecules that induce maximum expansion and anti-CD19
cytotoxicity in NK cells. These studies stem from T.he observation that expression of anti-CD19 receptors in
NK cells bypasses inhibitory mechanisms and confers anti-ALL cytotoxicity, and rely on a novel method to
efficiently transduce the receptors in NK cells. The results should lead to clinical studies of NK cells in
patients with refractory ALL and may expand the clinical use of these cells in cancer therapy. Studies in
Specific Aim 2 will determine whether immune cells expressing anti-CD19 receptors can eradicate ALL in
xenogeneic murine models of leukemia. The relative anti-leukemic capacity of NK cells and T cells, the
potential benefits of 4-IBB and CD28 co-stimulation, and the effectiveness of infusing cells directed against
two different leukemia-associated antigens will be assessed. If promising, the results should provide a strong
rationale for clinical testing of receptor-modified autologous and allogeneic immune cells in patients with
drug-resistant ALL. Specific Aim 3 is to increase the clinical safety of receptor-modified immune cells. Gene
constructs that allow simultaneous expression of the receptors and of CD20 will be developed in efforts to
render transduced cells susceptible to cytotoxicity mediated by Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody used
clinically. The function of T and NK cells transduced with these constructs and their sensitivity to Rituximab
will be tested in vitro and in vivo.
Chimeric receptor-directed immunotherapy is an emerging area of cancer research. The research proposed
should not only spur clinical studies of immune cells in patients with refractory ALL but also facilitate the
development of effective cell therapies for other neoplasms.","286536",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Our long-term objectives are to determine the basic mechanisms controlling branching morphogenesis and epithelial differentiation in prostate gland, i. e. to understand how growth control and cell differentiation are correlated during normal organogenesis, and what may be the weak links contributing to innate or acquired glandular pathologies, in particular benign and malignant prostate tumors. Towards this aim the goals of the present proposal are to explore the role of Notch signaling in normal prostate organogenesis: in prostate branching morphogenesis, in defining the epithelial prebud sites; and in cell fate choice, in epithelial differentiation, progenitor cell maintenance and proliferation. In the first specific aim, we will investigate the expression and activity of Notch pathway genes during embryonic and postnatal development of mouse prostate. In specific aims two, developmental regulation of Notch pathway by mesenchymal signaling factors will will be explored in vivo, in prostates from Bmp7 and Gli3 mutant mouse, and in organ culture. In specific aim four, we will assess the effect of gain of Notch function and inhibition of Notch function in epithelial proliferation, morphogenesis and differentiation vie retroviral infections, antisense oligonucleotide assays, and analysis of Hes knockout prostates. Results of this work will aid towards greater understanding of branching morphogenesis and differentiation of prostate and other glandular organs, such as mammary gland and lungs, and lead towards further insight on how benign and malignant epithelial tumors may arise and overcome the tissue specific growth restrictions. In perspective, those results may aid towards novel therapies to overcome genetic or injury inflicted pathologies in branched glands.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this grant proposal is to determine the physiological role and mechanism of action of a phosphaturic factor, FGF 7, and to establish its role in the pathogenesis of hypophosphatemic diseases. Our hypothesis is that FGF 7 is a potent PTN that inhibits Wnt signaling, thereby reducing renal Pi reabsorption. We will first determine whether FGF 7 has properties of a PTN. We will assess how the activity of FGF 7 is related to that of other PTNs by determining whether FGF 7 alters Wnt signaling and whether it plays a role in the pathogenesis of hypophosphatemic diseases. In aim 1, we will investigate whether FGF 7 has properties similar to those of other PTNs, FGF-23 and sFRP-4. The activity of FGF 7 will be compared with that of other PTNs such as FGF-23 and sFRP-4. We will determine if FGF 7 alters vitamin D metabolism by measuring serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations in rats following administration of FGF 7. The effect of FGF 7 on 25(OH)D1(OH)ase activity, mRNA and protein expression will be assessed. The capacity of FGF 7 to inhibit bone mineralization will be examined. The biological effects of FGF 7 administration will be confirmed by examining the phenotype of Fgf 7 gene knockout mice. In aim 2, we will determine the nephron segment in which FGF 7 is active, and we will investigate whether FGF 7 inhibits Pi transport by reducing the activity, amount and distribution of the renal Na+Pi cotransporter. Aim 3 is designed to establish signaling pathways (receptor kinase/MAPK and Wnt/beta-catenin) involved in the inhibition of Pi uptake by FGF 7. In aim 4, we will determine if serum FGF 7 is increased in patients with TIO and XLH and in animal models of XLH. The modulation of FGF 7 by diets high or low in Pi content will be assessed to determine whether alterations in serum Pi induced by dietary changes in Pi, influence FGF 7 similarly to the hypophosphatemia in patients or animal models with renal Pi wasting. In aim 5, we will assess the relative contribution of the PTNs, FGF 7, FGF-23 and sFRP-4, to the pathogenesis of hypophosphatemia seen in animal models of renal Pi wasting.   
Significance: Our experiments will define a role for FGF 7 in Pi homeostasis, the regulation of vitamin D metabolism, and bone mineralization and will delineate the pathophysiologic role of FGF 7 in diseases such as TIO and XLH. The interaction between the FGF 7 and other PTNs will be clarified. Such information will significantly enhance our knowledge of mineralization processes and Pi homeostasis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Src homology phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) promotes cell proliferation and survival signals induced by receptor Tyr kinases. More specifically, SHP2 is a requisite for EGFR and HER2 signaling pathways, receptors commonly dysregulated in breast and other cancers. In addition to the Ras-ERK and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, SHP2 transduces ?-catenin signaling downstream of the EGFR and HER2. Therefore, SHP2 acts as a mediator and integrator of these pathways, which are generally regarded as separate. Moreover, our preliminary studies show that SHP2 is overexpressed in breast tumors, suggesting that its increased expression might enhance tumor growth. However, how SHP2 positively modulates the EGFR/HER2 and the ?-catenin signaling pathways is poorly understood. Thus, this research proposal addresses the under-explored, but important area in cancer. The central hypothesis is that SHP2-mediated synergy between the EGFR/HER2 and ?-catenin signaling pathways underlies the mechanism of SHP2 in promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell transformation, leading to breast tumor development. This hypothesis is based on the following findings: i) SHP2 is a positive effector of mitogenic and cell survival signals, traits dysregulated in a cancer cell, ii) SHP2 integrates ?-catenin signaling with Ras and PI3K pathways, and iii) it is overexpressed in breast cancer. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to explore the extent of SHP2 overexpression in breast cancer and elucidate the mechanism of action of SHP2 in HER2 signaling and transformation, 2) to study the molecular mechanism for EGFR/HER2-induced and SHP2-mediated ?-catenin activation and 3) to investigate the importance of SHP2 in HER2-induced tumorigenesis in vivo. SHP2 protein overexpression in primary breast tumors will be investigated by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. The mechanism of action of SHP2 in HER2 and ?-catenin signaling will be investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, expression in appropriate cells and determining the effect of these expressions on signaling, cell growth and transformation. Finally, the importance of SHP2 in HER2-induced tumorigenesis will be studied in HER2 transgenic and SHP2 knockout (specifically in the mammary gland) mice.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  
  
This proposal is designed to provide the candidate a 1-2 year period of mentored research in the laboratory of Dr. A. T. Look (at the Dana Farber), a pioneer in the use of zebrafish as a model to study development of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system and neuroblastoma. This proposal is also designed to support the candidate as an independent investigator during the first 3 years of a new faculty appointment in a neurobiology/oncology department. The goal of this application is to use the zebrafish as a model to dissect the molecular components of Foxd3-mediated neural crest cell survival and migration and to determine if this pathway promotes metastasis of neural crest-derived tumors in vivo. The zebrafish, with its close synteny to the human genome and its conserved molecular pathways regulating the development of tissues and organs, offers a powerful tool with which to conduct such research. The candidate has identified and characterized a zebrafish mutant Foxd3 line that has specific neural crest cell survival and migration defects and has identified the Snail b transcription factor as a critical mediator of Foxd3 function. The underlying hypothesis of this application is that knowledge of the Foxd3 pathway will provide an understanding of how neural crest cells migrate and survive in foreign environments, a requirement for the metastasis of neural crest-derived tumors. In Aim 1, genetic epistasis and biochemistry will determine if Foxd3 directly activates snail b expression in neural crest cells, and whether Snail b represses apoptosis and cell migration by repressing the expression of the promising candidates, puma and e-cadherin, respectively. In Aim 2, GFP-labeled neural crest cells from Foxd3 mutant and wild-type siblings will be analyzed by microarray to identify and analyze additional downstream targets of Foxd3-mediated neural crest cell survival and migration. In Aim 3, Foxd3 and snail b will be over-expressed in developing neural crest cells to examine their potential roles in promoting metastasis in established zebrafish neural crest tumor models. During normal development, cells from the neural tube detach, activate survival programs and migrate to distant regions of the embryo. This process is similar to the way cells behave during metastasis in human cancers. The goal of this application is to find the genes involved in the normal embryonic survival and migration programs and determine if these genes are aberrantly activated during cancer metastasis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Failure of therapeutic trials for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD) reflects our poor mechanistic understanding of the disease. The long term goal of this project is to improve the mechanistic understanding of COPD. The two major pathologic features of COPD that contribute to airway obstruction are loss of alveolar walls and wall thickening of small airways (<2mm). Small airway changes progress with increasing severity of COPD and therefore represent a therapeutic target to stabilize or potentially reverse airway obstruction. Recent investigation suggests that TGF¿ is likely to play a major mechanistic role in wall thickening in COPD by regulating the balanced autocrine and paracrine interactions between airway epithelial and mesenchymal cell types, collectively known as the epithelial-mesenchymal trophic unit (EMTU). These autocrine and paracrine interactions dictate cellular differentiation during lung development. Imbalances in these interactions could result from chronic airway injury (e.g. tobacco smoke) and lead to airway remodeling. TGF¿ isoforms are expressed by all cell types within the EMTU, but almost entirely in an inactive form. Hence, activation of TGF¿ is a major point of regulation of TGF¿ function. We have recently developed one of the first in vitro models of the human EMTU (Araya, et al, Am. J. Path, 2006) and have used it to determine that the integrin av¿8 plays a major role in TGF¿ activation, and subsequent autocrine and paracrine interactions between airway epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Using human COPD samples, we demonstrate increased ¿8 expression in both the airway epithelium and small airway fibroblasts, which significantly correlates with declining pulmonary function and airway wall thickening. These findings have led us to our overall hypothesis: Increased av¿8-dependent activation of TGF¿ in COPD airway epithelial cells and fibroblasts leads to inappropriate reactivation of morphogenic programs within the EMTU, which leads to airway remodeling. Using physiologically relevant primary human airway epithelial and fibroblast cell culture systems, we will: 1) determine the mechanism of increased (38 expression in COPD by airway epithelial cells and fibroblasts; 2) determine mechanism of increased av¿8-mediated activation of TGF¿ in COPD; 3) determine the functional consequence of increased av¿8-mediated activation of TGF¿ in autocrine and paracrine interactions between airway epithelial and fibroblast cell types. TGF¿ is one of the most fibrogenic cytokines known, but because of its normal homeostatic role in virtually all tissues, therapies targeted at global TGF¿ neutralization will also have undesired systemic effects. The TGF¿ activating integrin, av¿8, is upregulated in COPD but has a highly restricted pattern of expression in normal human tissues making it a possible therapeutic target to specifically inhibit TGF¿ in COPD. This proposal is the first step in testing the therapeutic potential of inhibiting av¿8 function in COPD.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The bronchoconstriction of asthma squeezes airway epithelial cells. This mechanical perturbation triggers a cascade of cellular signaling events that had previously been attributed largely to immune based inflammatory mechanisms. Over the past several years we have shown that mechanical stress-induced signaling events modify the phenotype of the epithelial cells themselves and activate fibroblasts in co-culture in a manner reminiscent of that observed in human asthma. In fact, this pattern of multicellular activation recapitulates in vitro, without activation of any immune inflammatory mechanism, the pro-fibrotic and mucus secretory micro-environment present in the asthmatic airway. Microarray analysis of the genes expressed in mechanically stressed airway epithelial cells has suggested that the downstream effects of mechanical stress on epithelial and mesenchymal cells are specific and targeted. We have demonstrated that mechanical perturbation of the airway epithelium can modify the phenotype of epithelial cells in culture leading to the microenvironmental availability of epidermal growth factor ligands and members of the urokinase plasminogen activator family. In the proposed work we will define the mechanisms that link the availability of these factors with the phenotypic changes that occur in co-cultured fibroblasts when these cells are placed in proximity to airway epithelial cells undergoing a single episode of mechanical stress. We will also define the mechanisms that link repeated episodes of mechanical stress on airway epithelial cells with the changes in secretory phenotype that occur as a result of this stress. Our work comprises a systematic investigation of the role played by these critical candidate pathways in the native context of the multicellular epithelial-mesenchymal structure of the airway wall. The data we propose to gather will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that link the various biochemical effector systems that are activated by compressive stress. This work will provide the evidence needed to validate the paradigm shift from regarding airway remodeling events as arising predominantly from an immunological mechanism to one which shows that bronchoconstriction alone can leave a specific remodeling signature on the airway. Lay Summary: When airways narrow during an asthma attack the cells lining these airways are compressed. Our data show that this compression activates these cells in a way similar to that observed in human asthma. In this research we will investigate the links between compression of cells and the changes in their activation state. This understanding could lead to new strategies for treating asthma.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are a wide range of human clinical disorders in limb growth. Some are due to single genes while others are complex, due to many genes and their interactions with each other and the environment. Longitudinal studies of the cellular and molecular bases for variation in limb growth are hampered by the need for destructive or terminal sampling to obtain phenotypic measures, even in model organisms. We propose to measure genetic variation in long bone growth, associated histomorphological features, and gene expression in mice in order to identify the genetic and physiological processes underlying limb growth variations. These studies will be carried out with animals from the LGXSM Recombinant Inbred (Rl) strains. Previous mapping studies in the F2 intercross of these strains uncovered 17 genomic locations affecting adult long bone length. However, these earlier studies do not identify which developmental periods or physiological processes are responsible for variations in limb length. We will map limb growth QTLs in the Rl strains because this allows the collection of detailed phenotypes requiring terminal preparations at a series of consecutive ages on animals of identical genotype. Thus, we will be able to obtain ""longitudinal"" data for limb growth traits for specific genotypes. Mapping limb growth QTLs in the Rl strains will identify genomic regions affecting long bone growth and its associated physiological and molecular processes to 15 cM regions of the genome. We will fine-map these QTLs in the Advanced Intercross (Al) line formed by repeatedly intercrossing LG/J and SM/J strains to the F32 generation. At this point they will have accumulated 16x the recombination generated in the original F2 intercross allowing for 16x the genomic mapping resolution (sub-cM scale). Positional candidate genes will be identified within the sub-cM QTL support regions and evaluated for sequence and expression differences between the parental lines. The outcome of these experiments will be a better understanding of the genetic, molecular, and cellular processes responsible for variation in limb growth with consequences for our understanding of pathologies of growth.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heparan sulfate (HS) binds and functionally modulates a number of growth factors and morphogens. Genetic studies have revealed that HS is an integral component of many developmental signaling pathways in model animals. However, our understanding of the role of HS in the mammalian skeletal development and remodeling is still quite limited, and this is in spite of the fact that the tissue most affected by aberrant expression of HS is bone. For example, mutations of the gene encoding an enzyme essential for HS synthesis cause Hereditary Multiple Exostosis (HME), which is one of the most common genetic bone disorders in clinical orthopedics. In the adults, long-term heparin treatment for patients with thromboembolism and other vascular diseases often leads to a low bone mass condition resembling osteoporosis. The improved understanding of the mechanisms by which HS regulates growth factor signaling in the developing and adult skeletal system is critical for devising therapies for these diseases. Toward this long- term goal, we have employed conditional mouse genetics approaches to dissect the function of HS in skeletal development and physiology. Our evidence suggests that HS is essential for normal skeletal patterning and skeletal cell differentiation, being involved in key growth factor signaling pathways. Based on these and other preliminary data, we propose the following specific aims: 1. To dissect time-dependence and structural specificity of HS function in chondrogenesis. 2. To determine the mechanisms by which HS regulates BMP function during chondrogenesis. 3. To determine the role of HS in developmental bone formation and the regulation of bone mass. The proposed studies will generate new insights into the pathogenesis of HME, and may help define new drug targets for osteoporosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heparan sulfate is essential for normal bone development and physiology, as illustrated by the existence of the genetic (hereditary multiple exostosis) and metabolic (heparin- induced osteoporosis) bone diseases that are directly linked to aberrant expression of heparan sulfate. This project will employ advanced mouse genetics to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which heparan sulfate regulates bone cell function. The proposed studies will generate new insights into the pathogenesis of hereditary multiple exostosis, and may help define new drug targets for osteoporosis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Growth factors and their receptors play a prominent role in inherited human diseases, which range from malformations of bone, vasculature, pigmentation, and digits to abnormalities which contribute to cancer predisposition.  During embryonic development, growth factor signals must be precisely controlled in order for normal development to occur.  Although growth factors are known to be important in contributing to cell survival and growth, it is not precisely known how they signals trigger and mediate extremely complex structures such as the limb, the lung, the kidney, and the skin.  In addition to the normal regulatory controls of the cell to limit overactivity and duration of growth factor signals, other inhibitors of growth factor signaling may actually play a role themselves in direct growth and patterning of complex structures.  Recently, a novel family of inhibitors was identified in Drosophila as an important contributor to the complex process of tracheal branching.  The inhibitors were thus given the name, Sprouty.  The Sprouty gene is evolutionarily conserved and in human, there are four Sprouty genes, Spry1, 2, 3, and 4.  They are known to inhibit the growth factor, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and may affect other growth factors as well.  It is possible that Sprouty genes and the proteins they encode contribute to the patterning complex structures in vertebrates. Our laboratory studies the complex process of limb development and in particular the role that FGFs play in its patterning.  The Sprouty genes are turned out in the limb at approximately the same time that FGFs are expressed. I hypothesize that Sprouty genes play a role in patterning the limb.  To test this question, he has analyzed the effect of the loss of Spry4 on the development of the limb.  Loss of Spry4 leads to a number of digit malformations, many of them resemble digit defects in humans.  In this proposal, I will study the molecular basis for these abnormalities and determine the contribution of FGF signaling and other Sprouty genes in these digit defects.  These studies will provide insights into how Spry4 affects FGF signaling and into how complex structures are normally patterned.

DESCRIPTION: Dry eye syndrome affects millions of people worldwide and is one of the most common ocular diseases. Dry eye syndromes are relatively common among the aging population and in women. Though the pathogenesis of dry eye likely involves multiple components, lacrimal gland dysfunction and tear deficiencies are major components. The absence of tears, in severe cases, can lead to abrasion of the corneal surface and blindness. Though lacrimal gland physiology has been well studied, relatively very little is known about the regulatory mechanisms that shape lacrimal gland development. Our long-term goal is to define these regulatory mechanisms and to build a comprehensive model of glandular development. Acquisition of this knowledge will be critical for devising alternative treatment options for patients with lacrimal gland disorders such as dry eye syndromes. Our previous studies have shown that FGF-10, a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, is both necessary and sufficient for initiation of differentiation of lacrimal and Harderian glands in the murine eye. These studies established FGF-10 as an important component of the signaling system that induces glandular growth and Differentiation. Mutations in FGF-10 in human patients have been shown to be the underlying cause for aplasia of the lacrimal and salivary glands (ALSG) syndrome, a condition characterized by irritable eyes and dryness of the mouth. These findings underscore the importance of FGF-10 signaling to human lacrimal gland development. The objective of this application is to build on our previous studies and define the roles of downstream components of the FGF-10 signaling pathway that are critical for glandular differentiation. We will focus our efforts on Ras, a downstream effector of FGF-10 signaling (Aim 1), Sprouty, a downstream target and antagonist of FGF-10 signaling (Aim 2), and Edar (ectodysplasin receptor), a downstream target of FGF-10 signaling (Aim 3). These studies will be performed by gain- and loss-of-function studies in mice. As the FGF-10 signaling pathway has been shown to be a critical regulator of branching and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in multiple organ rudiments including the lungs and limbs, a clear understanding of the mechanistic details of the FGF-10 signaling pathway will have broad significance in the field of developmental biology. In addition, the proposed studies will, in the long-term, allow the development of novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of patients with dry eye syndromes.

MT1-MMP-deficient mice temporarily survive despite a severe skeletal phenotype caused by cellular collagen indigestion. This led us to question if collagen remodeling ultimately is required for development and growth or if compensatory mechanisms are enabled to facilitate matrix remodeling.  We established by in situ hybridization that the molecular relative of MT1-MMP, MT3-MMP, is expressed abundantly in skeletal tissues in a pattern overlapping, in part, that of MT1-MMP. To test the hypothesis that MT3-MMP can ameliorate the loss of collagenolytic activity, we generated mice with targeted disruption of MT3-MMP. These mice display a modest, yet significant phenotype in adulthood, with diminished growth of the cranium and limbs when compared to wildtype littermates. Mice deficient for both MT3-MMP and MT1-MMP, on the other hand, display profound developmental defects in the appendicular and craniofacial skeleton, including cleft palate, and die immediately after birth.  The observed phenotypic traits indicate that the loss of a second collagenolytic enzyme is catastrophic, and demonstrate that MT3-MMP is the molecule responsible for survival of MT1-MMP deficient mice. Consistent with these findings, MT3-MMP confers collagenolytic activity to collagenase-deficient MT1-MMP-null cells when expressed in these cells in vitro. Taken together, the data identify MT3-MMP as a major mesenchymal collagenase in vivo, and demonstrate that collagen remodeling is essential for embryonic development and post-natal life.

MT1-MMP is required for efficient tumor dissemination in experimental metastatic disease.

Aside from the essential role in embryonic and postnatal matrix remodeling of skeletal and peri-skeletal tissues MT1-MMP is also found in pathophysiological conditions. Accordingly, membrane-type I matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) is associated with multiple forms of cancer including mammary cancer which has a high frequency of metastasis to the skeleton and as such constitutes a serious challenge to skeletal health.  To directly evaluate the significance of MT1-MMP expression in tumor progression and metastasis using a genetically induced cancer model, we crossed MT1-MMP-deficient mice to MMTV-polyoma virus middle T-antigen (PyMT) mice. Expression of PyMT in the MT1-MMP-deficient background consistently resulted in hyperplasia of the mammary gland as seen in wild-type PyMT littermates.  Because of the reduced life span of MT1-MMP deficient mice, we applied orthotopic transplantation of PyMT+ glands into the cleared mammary fat pad of syngeneic recipient mice to evaluate tumor progression and metastasis in MT1-MMP-deficient tumors.  Mutant tumors were palpable earlier than wild-type tumors and grew to the experimental end point size quicker than control tumors, but demonstrated markedly reduced ability to metastasize to the lungs of recipient mice.  Accordingly, MT1-MMP-deficient mice displayed an overall reduction in metastasis count of 50%.  Importantly, MT1-MMP was expressed solely in the stroma of PyMT-induced tumors and those metastatic nodules that formed in the lungs were devoid of MT1-MMP expression.  In an effort to identify the underlying cause for the reduction in metastasis we analyzed the collagenolytic activity stromal cells. Stromal fibroblasts isolated from MT1-MMP-deficient tumors did not degrade type I collagen suggesting that efficient dissemination of tumor cells is dependent on stromal cell remodeling of the tumor environment. The data demonstrate directly that MT1-MMP-mediated proteolysis by stromal cells is important in the metastatic process and contributes to the dissemination of MT1-MMP negative cancer cells.  Equally important, these findings also suggest that anti-MMP therapeutic strategies to inhibit tumor formation are unlikely to succeed given the prolific growth of tumors derived from MT1-MMP deficient mice.","1149564",

Most, if not all, of these events involve modifications of cell-cell and       cell-matrix adhesion, and abnormal modifications of these adhesion systems are often       associated with the formation of tumors. The Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases and their       ligands, the ephrins, are frequently over-expressed in a wide variety of cancers, including       breast, small-cell lung and gastrointestinal cancers, melanomas, and neuroblastomas. Using the       Xenopus embryonic system, we have demonstrated that signaling mediated by the intracellular       domain of ephrinB affects cell-cell adhesion, and that this activity can be modulated by       interaction with an activated FGF receptor. We and our collaborators presented evidence that       ephrinB1 signaling alters the gastrulation movements of neuro-ectodermal stem cells and is       necessary for these cells to move into the eye field. Using loss-of-function (via morpholino       oligonucleotides) and gain-of-function or rescue experiments in the amphibian system, we       provide critical in vivo evidence that ephrinB1 signaling through its intracellular domain       controls retinal progenitor cell movement into the eye field by co-opting the PCP pathway.       These findings are unique in several ways. First, we demonstrate that ephrinB1 can associate       with Xdsh via the Xdsh DEP domain and mediate the movement of retinal progenitor cells into       the eye field. Second, we establish that ephrinB1 control of retinal progenitor movement       requires signaling through its intracellular domain and is mediated by downstream members of       the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway. Moreover, forward signaling through the cognate Eph       receptor and canonical Wnt signaling are not essential for this process. We have also found       that Signaling through the FGF receptor leads to phosphorylation of ephrinB1 in its C-terminus       and de-couples PCP signaling from ephrin. These results importantly bridge two signaling       pathways that control cell movement, and two developmental fields, local signaling and stem       cell specification. These studies mechanistically link ephrinB1 and the non-canonical Wnt/PCP       signaling pathways as co-regulators of an important morphogenetic process, and show that this       signaling pathway regulates cell fate by controlling changes in cell movement.","589231",

mammalian respiratory system to the inhalation of ambient concentrations of oxidant air pollutants. The focus
of this renewal application will be on mechanisms of environmentally induced asthma in young children, using
the model of environmental allergic asthma in infant rhesus monkeys that we have developed through support
of this program. Using this model over the previous five years of funding, we have made a number of startling
discoveries regarding the effect of chronic ozone exposure on lung development and growth during infancy,
including: stunting of airway growth, postnatal loss of airway generations, impaired establishment of the FGF-2
ternary signaling complex by basal cells, the failure of epithelial surfaces to innervate, impaired central nervous
control, enhancement of the allergic response, airway hyperreactivity, disrupted alveolarization, and airway
remodeling. The analytical framework in which all of the studies proposed for this renewal will be conducted is
the epithelial/mesenchymal trophic unit, whose cellular components establish trophic interactions via an
extracellular signaling complex modulated by the basement membrane zone.
The overall hypothesis for this program is that environmental exposure to oxidant air pollutants promotes the
development of allergic asthma in the developing lungs of young children and exacerbates its severity by: 1)
disrupting the homeostasis within the epithelial/mesenchymai trophic unit and 2) fundamentally compromising
the establishment and differentiation of the trophic interactions that promote normal airway growth and
development. These changes result from the superimposition of continual cycles of acute injury, inflammation,
and repair on the immune response to allergen exposure.
This Project  will focus on innervation and neural control within the epithelial/mesenchymal trophic unit, with the
following specific aims:
1) Determine the impact of O3 and/or house dust mite (HDM) allergen inhalation on the sensory innervation of
the conducting airways, its relation to growth factors and cues within the epithelial/mesenchymal trophic
unit during critical windows of postnatal development, and whether these changes persist into adult life.
2) Determine the impact of episodic O3 and/or HDM allergen inhalation on the sensory nerve activity arising
from multiple airway generations and structures during critical windows of postnatal development and
determine whether these changes persist into adult life.
3) Determine the critical window of susceptibility when exposure to O3 and/or HDM allergen results in
persistent changes in smooth muscle contractility due to altered neural control.
4) Determine how the early and continued alteration in the balance between sympathetic and
parasympathetic nerve activity to airway-associated lymph nodes modulates antigen recognition and
lymphocyte phenotype and determine whether this modulation persist into adult life.

Previously culture conditions were established for clonal expansion of cells in low calcium medium, which lead to the expression of mesenchymal markers (epithelial-mesenchymal transformation, EMT), and re-epithelialization in normal calcium medium, leading to partial regain of ductal and acinar markers (mesenchymal-epithelial transformation, MET).  Cells expanded in low calcium medium and replated in Matrigel formed 3D structures that expressed some but not all ductal markers, and some, but not all acinar markers. 

This year, primary cells grown under low calcium conditions were compared to two immortalized cell lines (HSG and HSY), which are the only lines available for the study of salivary differentiation, in order to gain some insight into ways that we can modify our conditions to get more complete re-establishment of the ductal and acinar morphology and markers.  Unlike SGSCs grown in low calcium medium, HSG and HSY do not express mesenchymal markers.  All three cells types were found to express the ductal marker, cytokeratin 19, and acinar markers, aquaporin 5, chromogranin B and amylase.  When plated into 50% Matrigel, all three cell types were found to form 3D aggregates, and aquaporin 5 was dramatically upregulated.  Based on a recent publication suggesting that acinar structures are better supported by type I collagen, similar experiments were performed using rat tail collagen gels, however, this culture conditions did not support the formation of 3D structures of any of the cell types.  

The cell surface markers that are expressed by the cells grown in low calcium and high calcium medium are being examined.  Based on recent studies that pericytes that express CD146 may represent a source of local progenitor cells, we examined salivary glands by immunohistochemistry, and clonal lines by FACS for CD146 expression.  As expected CD146 cells were observed surrounding blood vessels in the intact gland.  In newly established clonal lines and in freshly isolated cells, CD146 is highly expressed.  Current studies are aimed at determining if pre-sorting for CD146 gives rise to clonal populations of cells that can more efficiently undergo EMT and then MET in vitro.  

In vivo transplantation

A method for transplanting ex vivo expanded cells subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice in conjunction with a mixture of Matrigel with polyglycolic acid polymer (PGA) was established, and it was found that mini structures with ductile elements (cytokeratin 19 positive) surrounded by clusters of cells with acinar markers (aquaporin and amylase) were formed.  In order to determine if these structures could be functional, cells were placed with the Matrigel/PGA scaffold into damaged salivary glands (surgical wound).  Again, the human SGSCs produced small gland-like structures and RT-PCR for human markers showed expression of acinar and ductal elements.  However, human salivary proteins, histatin or chromogranin B, were not detected in the mouse saliva, indicating that a functional connection was not made between the remaining mouse salivary gland and the human transplant.  Interestingly, while HSG and HSY transplants did express ductal and acinar markers, their organization was quite different from that of the SGSCs.  They formed carcinoma-like masses of cells.  Cell transplantation was also performed with type I collagen gels, but none of the three cells types grew within these constructs.  

Based on these results, it is apparent that better ways are needed to encourage MET to form functional ductal and acinar elements in the appropriate architecture.","158586",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) signaling has a central role in craniofacial and tooth development. Moreover, Bmp-signaling is known to be involved in human diseases such as juvenile polyposis syndromes in which mutations in the type I Bmp receptor, BmpR1A, have been discovered. Moreover other studies, that identified mutations in the type II Bmp receptor, BmpRII in families with pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH), uncovered a role for Bmp-signaling in the development or homeostasis of the pulmonary vasculature. A firm understanding about the role of Bmp signaling in craniofacial morphogenesis has been limited by the early embryonic lethality of the Bmp4 and Bmp2 null mutant mice. This research program will directly investigate the function of Bmp4 and Bmp2 in craniofacial organogenesis using conditional gene inactivation studies. We propose to dissect the temporal and tissue specific requirements for Bmp4 and Bmp2 signaling in branchial arch and incisor tooth morphogenesis by using cre recombinase transgenic methods to precisely inactivate or overexpress Bmp ligands. Epithelial-mesenchymal signaling is a central theme in vertebrate organogenesis. In this research program, we propose to study Bone Morphogenetic Protein (Bmp)-signaling in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during mandibular and tooth development. In the forming mandible, signaling between a specified branchial arch ectoderm and a plastic mesenchyme is thought to regulate mandibular morphogenesis. Recent work also indicates that signaling from pharyngeal endoderm is important for early mandibular morphogenesis. We propose to investigate the role of Bmp-signaling from pharyngeal endoderm in mandibular development. Tooth organogenesis initiates at stereotypical sites within the mandible and maxilla. Moreover, the rodent incisor tooth contains a stem cell niche in the incisor, called the cervical loop, that is necessary for lifelong incisor growth. We propose to study the function of Bmp4 and Bmp2 in development of the incisor cervical loop niche. The incisor is also a valuable system to investigate ameloblast cytodifferentiation along a simple, anterior-posterior axis. Our preliminary data suggest that Bmp4 has a critical role in ameloblast development that we propose to investigate in this research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bmp-signaling has been implicated in human inherited disorders including juvenile polyposis that involve regulation of colonic epithelial growth. Other human genetic studies, that identified mutations in the type II Bmp receptor, BmpRII in families with pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) uncovered a role for Bmp-signaling in the development or homeostasis of the pulmonary vasculature.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial birth defects represent devastating psychosocial complications as well as a significant socioeconomic burden. Among them, cleft palate posed an annual ""national bill"" exceeding $100 million in 2004 in direct hospital costs alone and is highly prevalent as the incidence is roughly 0.1% (one in 1000 children), making it the second most common birth defect. Previous studies indicate that the pathogenesis of cleft palate is multifactorial and likely has both genetic and environmental factors. Much of our knowledge of craniofacial clefting arises from case studies of patients and although limited, selected animal models. A number of genes have been identified to be associated with the cleft palate phenotype, but the etiology of the majority of cases remains elusive. Affected children require multiple operations to address not only palate closure, but also associated problems with speech, feeding, dentition, and other craniofacial growth deficiencies. The function of GSK-32 has previously been shown to be intimately related to and necessary for normal craniofacial development. The central hypothesis of this application is that signal transduction pathways dependent on GSK-32 control the development of the secondary palate. This proposal will use genetic analysis and novel protein regulation techniques to study the roles of GSK-32 in palate formation. Two Specific Aims are proposed to explore the roles of GSK-32 in palatogenesis and fusion. The first aim will address the mechanistic requirements of GSK-32 signaling in palatogenesis while the second aim brings a new technique to control levels of GSK-32 protein to the study of palate development. In the first aim, the mechanism(s) underlying the cleft of the secondary palate in GSK-32 mutant mice will be explored. Palatal shelves in this mutant have previously been shown to develop seemingly appropriately during embryogenesis, but fail to fuse. This deficiency may be the result of defective palatal shelf growth, cell apoptosis and/or transdifferentiation, and the first part of this aim will look in vivo to investigate markers of these processes during palatogenesis in mutant compared to the wild-type palates. In the second part, in vitro organ culture will be used to determine if the mutant palateal shelves are capable of fusion when placed in apposition in organ culture. In the second aim, the study of palatogenesis using a drug-dependent GSK-32 allele during distinct stages will be undertaken. Because GSK-32 is required at different times in different regions, complete early loss of its activity may preclude study of its action at a downstream time and location   for example, growth and fusion events in the palate after defective maxillogenesis. This system is novel and requires further investigation and adaptation to in vitro protocols. Taken together, these two aims will pinpoint the spatial and temporal requirements of GSK-32 signaling and greatly advance our knowledge of the mechanistic causes of human orofacial clefting. Furthermore, the new protein regulation techniques that we develop will serve as a template for future developmental studies.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children and families affected by cleft palate must not only endure multiple, physiologically challenging surgeries to address palate closure, but also associated problems with speech, feeding, dentition, and other facial growth deficiencies. In addition, cleft palate brings with it devastating psychosocial implications for many children as well as significant socioeconomic burden exceeding $100 million in direct hospital costs alone. These facts are significant and while certain genes and environmental factors have been associated with the development of cleft palate, the cause in the majority of cases remains unknown and further study is extremely important.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T-box genes encode a family of transcription factors that are expressed in multiple tissues and function in diverse genetic pathways during development. Mutations in humanTBX3 and TBX5 result in autosomal dominant, ulnar-mammary (UMS) and Holt-Oram syndromes, respectively, and TBX1 deficiency contributes to human deletion 22q11 syndromes. Patients with UMS have congenital limb, apocrine gland, tooth, and genital abnormalities. TBX3 loss-of-function mutations that disrupt DNA binding may cause some cases of UMS. Other mutations occur in regions required for protein-protein interactions or disrupt regulatory (activator or repressor) function. No genotype-phenotype correlations have been detected in affected humans. Murine Tbx3 null heterozygotes do not manifest the UMS phenotype and most homozygous null mutants die in midgestation. Thus, determining the specific effects of Tbx3 deficiency in different regions of the developing limb, or in other organs, requires conditional mutation of murine Tbx3. The goal of this project is to generate conditional mouse models of Tbx3 disruption and dysfunction and examine the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which mutations of Tbx3 cause birth defects, with an emphasis on the limb. We will disrupt Tbx3 function conditionally and use recombinase -mediated cassette exchange to mutate distinct Tbx3 protein functional domains. Alterations in gene expression, cellular differentiation, migration, proliferation and survival will be examined. We have already discovered a novel phenotype due to dominant negative effects of an Exon 7 mutation and propose to analyze its transcriptional function. Genotype -phenotype correlations may also be defined to direct new investigations in humans with UMS. The flexible model system we propose will be a valuable tool for developmental studies of many organs and lead to a deeper understanding of the genetic and molecular bases of congenital anomalies in humans.

We have recently proposed that disrupting normal homeostatic epithelial-mesenchymal communications, and the consequent alveolar interstitial fibroblast (AIF)-to-myofibroblast (MYF) transdifferentiation, are the key events in its pathobiology.  The specific molecular mechanisms involved in this process remain incompletely defined. The objective of this proposal is to determine the specific molecular mechanisms involved in BPD, particularly the role of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) signaling in hyperoxia-induced rat lung AIF-to-MYF transdifferentiation, using both in vivo and in vitro models and to determine the effectiveness of a novel molecular preventive and therapeutic approach.  In Specific Aim 1, using Laser Capture Microdissection, Morphometry, Immunohistochemistry, Real Time-PCR, Northern, and Western analyses, we will determine, in an in vivo neonatal rat model, how PPAR agonists prevent and/or treat hyperoxia-induced AIF-to-MYF transdifferentiation.  In Specific Aim 2, using Real Time -PCR, Northern and Western analyses, Metabolomics, Antisense, and Transfection in vitro studies, for the mRNA expression of Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein Receptor, PPAR, C/Enhancer Binding Protein, and Adipocyte Differentiation Related Protein, coupled with the differential expression and phosphorylation of the corresponding proteins, we will determine the mechanism involved in AIF-to-MYF transdifferentiation.  We will also determine how AIF-to-MYF transdifferentiation can be prevented or reversed by stimulating the lipogenic pathway through potent PPAR ligands such as rosiglitazone and GW7845.  This proposal, in addition to providing new insights into the pathobiology of BPD, has enormous potential for opening up novel interventional strategies to tackle chronic lung disease in general, and BPD in particular.  In fact, using the functional genomic approach, adopted in our proposal, i.e., inducing lipogenic transcription factors, may not only prevent, but may also reverse established chronic lung disease.  The concept put forward in this proposal is novel, innovative, and departs from the traditional paradigm of oxygen-induced lung damage, and may have much wider implications than simply understanding oxygen-induced lung injury.","326301",

Unlike peripheral cells which may be infected with viruses, the immune system has developed cell-sparing mechanisms of eliminating virus growth. These studies are directed at understanding host cytokine responses which regulate the replication of virus in neurons. 
In this competing renewal, Aims 1 and 2 are focused on the sensitization of neurons by type 1 interferon (IFN-beta). We will determine the cellular pathways which are activated and are able to effect an inhibitory role on the viral life cycle of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV); preliminary data show that these are distinct from that used by IFN-gamma. In most cell types, RNA viruses readily induce the production of IFN-beta during their replication, which includes double stranded RNA intermediates. However, in our preliminary studies, VSV is an exception, and no IFN-beta was detected during infection both in vivo and in vitro. We will characterize the means by which VSV prevents neuronal synthesis of IFN-beta which could protect neighboring cells. We will determine the mechanism of peripheral induction of IFN-beta gene expression at 24h post intranasal infection, and examine the role of Toll Like Receptors (TLR) in the responses both of neurons and of splenocytes; we will determine if PDC are responsible for IFN-beta synthesis. Aim 3 will continue our studies on the antiviral effector which is induced by type 2 IFN (IFN-gamma) nitric oxide (NO); we have shown that mRNA for NOS-1, the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase, does not change in cells treated with IFN-gamma, but the amount of the enzyme increases as does its activity. Studies are designed to define the novel mechanism of the increase in the enzyme which is induced by treatment of neurons with IFN-gamma. In aim 4, we will elucidate the mechanism by which this small molecule, NO, is able to inhibit viral protein synthesis and release of infectious virions from neurons. 
These studies are important because the insights gained will be beneficial in developing new and novel treatments for viral encephalitis considered new and emerging infections. They elucidate previously unsuspected interactions between the immune system and the central nervous system.","328543",

processes permit the evolution of changes in body plan. For this purpose, we compare the development of
extant organisms with respect to the ""tree of life"" (phylogeny) by which they arose. Comparisons between
diverse organisms should also help to determine which developmental features discovered in genetic model
organisms are more likely to be operating in human, and should shed light on the links between acute
perturbations of developmental mechanisms and birth defects.
 Leeches (segmented worms, phylum Annelida) belong to the super-phylum Lophotrochozoa, one of
three groups of bilaterally symmetric animals in the emerging phylogeny based on comparisons of DMA and
protein sequences between species. Lophotrochozoa includes roughly half of the extant phyla, including
non-acoel flatworms, molluscs and annelids. However, most research in development concerns vertebrates
(super-phylum Deuterostomia), nematode orfruitfly (both in the superpylum Ecdysozoa). Including
lophotrochozoan species will increase the breadth and power of comparative development. The leech
Helobdella is used because its embryo is among the best studied of the many lophotrochozoan species. It
also has a compact genome. As a result, along with a polychaete worm (Capitella) and a mollusc (Lottia),
Helobdella is one of 3 lophotrochozoans selected for whole genome sequencing by the Dept. of Energy's
Joint Genome Institute. Synergistic developmental and genomic analyses within and among these 3 species
will help to understand the links between genomic and developmental change.
 Specifically, the proposed research is to elucidate the role(s) of the TGFb pathway in the early leech
embryo, using in situ hybridization and RT-PCR to study gene expression, plus intracellular injection of
lineage tracers and mRNAs or anti-sense mopholino oligomers to compare cell fates in normal embryos with
those where the TGFb pathways have been disrupted. The proposed experiments will contribute to
understanding how TGFb signaling specifies dorsal fates in Drosophila, but ventral fates in vertebrates. They
will also contribute to understanding the cellular processes known as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions
(EMTs), which play a critical role both in normal development and in cancer metastasis.","279921",

melanocyte growth, expression of cell surface molecules, and cell shape. This dominance of keratinocytes
over the melanocytes is lost during transformation, allowing melanoma cells to invade into the dermis. By
studying cell-cell communication between normal melanocytes and keratinocytes, we are beginning to
understand how melanoma cells have escaped from keratinocytes' control. We now expand for normal
human skin the homeostatic concept of growth, differentiation, and survival or death and include stem cells as
a continuing source for differentiated, pigment-producing melanocytes. As model systems we use
melanocytes differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (NIH cell line codes WA01 and WA09) and
progenitor cells of the human hair follicle. The working hypothesis in the first aim is that cadherin-mediated
cell-cell interactions determine self-renewal of multi-potent progenitor, oligo-potent precursor and committed
melanocyte stem cells whereas cell-matrix interactions drive differentiation. Using a three-dimensional model
of normal human skin with a 'dermis' of fibroblasts embedded in collagen and an 'epidermis' with
melanocytes and multi-layered keratinocytes, we will determine whether proper positioning of mature
melanocytes at the basement membrane is controlled by integrin D6B1 and matricellular protein CCN3 and
whether improper activation of cell-cell signaling genes such as Notchl leads to transformation. Our
hypothesis is that melanocyte precursor and stem cells are more prone to transformation than mature,
pigment-producing melanocytes. Using culture conditions developed for human embryonic stem cells, we
have for aim 2 isolated melanoma cells from patients' lesions that have stem cell-like characteristics and
differentiate into melanogenic, adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic cell lineages. These 'melanoma
stem cells' represent a minor tumorigenic population and are characterized by the expression of the B cell
marker CD20. We will determine whether and how cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions regulate the CD20-
defined melanoma stem cell population and how CD20 can be optimally targeted for melanoma therapy.
These studies will demonstrate how dysregulation of homeostasis results in tumor formation and targeting
subpopulations of malignant cells leads to successful therapy.","263309",

The candidate has been trained in US in the field of molecular biology with high quality publications, and his long-term goal is to become an independent investigator, capable of directing high quality academic research in his research field. In addition to didactic courses, the candidate will learn several new research techniques through the duration of Award, such as gene targeting skill, electron microscopes skill, pulp cell culture, and tooth germ culture. Dentinogenesis requires the precise spatial and temporal coordination of programs for cell growth, differentiation, and mineralization. If one of these programs is interrupted or perturbed, tooth defects will likely occur. In a search for genes required for normal dentin morphogenesis we have studied Dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1) using an in vivo loss-of-function approach. Dmp1 null mice display profound tooth abnormalities, suggesting that DMP1 is required for normal dentinogenesis. Recent studies suggest that proteolytically processed fragments of DMP1 are responsible for its bioactivity. We propose that DMP1, an ECM protein highly active in odontoblasts, plays a key role in controlling dentinogenesis through its proteolytically processed forms. To test the hypothesis, transgenic approaches will be used to determine the ability of full-length DMP1 and its fragment to rescue the phenotype of Dmp1 null mice. In Aim 1 the tooth defects in mice lacking DMP1 will be characterized in detail and in relation to tooth morphogenesis. In Aim 2 the function of intact DMP1 will be determined by transgenic over-expression and rescue approaches using the Dmp1 null mice. Completion of these experiments during Scholar Development phase will set a solid foundation to further test the functional fragments of this protein in dentinogenesis in the Faculty Transition Phase. In Aim 3 in vivo function of cleaved fragment of DMP1 will be studied by re-expressing in Dmp1 null mice. In Aim 4 in vivo function of mutated DMP1 will be studied. Finishing the whole project will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of tooth morphogenesis and will identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention of dental diseases.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Researchers have demonstrated the potential utility of microfluidics for cell biology and its ability to define the environment. However, the use of microfluidics by biologists is still the exception. With the potential benefits of microfluidics clear, why have microfluidic systems not found more widespread use in cancer research and drug screening applications? Cancer is a complex disease and research into the basic mechanisms of the disease could benefit greatly from the ability to explore more factors more quickly and to utilize functionality (e.g., defined co-culture, precise temporal/spatial environmental control) that is not possible in traditional well culture. We believe there exist several barriers preventing microfluidic culture systems from having a major impact on cancer biology (accessibility, relevance, biological model, efficiency/throughput). Our broad aim is to bridge the gap between the worlds of engineering and cancer biology by understanding the needs/limitations of current cell-based cancer biology research and then providing a technology platform well matched to those needs and capable of addressing emerging needs (e.g., co-culture, 3D culture). Our innovative platform merges simple microfluidic technology (e.g., passive pumping) with existing pipetting methods to provide a range of cell manipulation functionality capable of highly parallel operation. We propose to demonstrate the accessibilty/ease of use of the platform, achieve measureable outcomes in throughput, efficiency, accuracy and robustness, and utilize the system to study growth regulation of mammary epithelial cells. Specific experiments include operational robustness, cell seeding consistency and assay execution. The biological focus of this project will be an extensive 2016 datapoint study exploring the response of the NMuMG cell line and primary mouse mammary epithelial cells (normal or lacking Sdc-1) to a variety of growth factors (EGF, IGF, FGF, insulin, FGF+TGF(3, serum, WntSA) at different concentrations. In addition, we will demonstrate a novel liquid valve to control soluble factor interactions between two cell types to study EMT thresholds. As part of these studies, we will demonstrate a 25X reduction in the number of animals required for typical 24 well plate cell-based studies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
Abnormal cardiac inflow tract remodeling can result in total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR), a life-threatening congenital heart defect. My human genetic studies and my preliminary expression and functional data in chick and mouse embryos suggest that PDGF-signaling is required for inflow tract remodeling and correct pulmonary venous connection. Asymmetric accumulation of cells in the heart stalk is thought to be important for inflow tract and pulmonary vein (PV) development. My data in chick show that Pdgfra and its ligand Pdgfa are expressed in mesenchyme on opposite sides of the heart stalk during PV formation and later around the PV as it matures. I hypothesize that asymmetric expression of PDGF signaling molecules in the heart stalk is required for normal inflow tract and PV development. The transcription factor PITX2 is a key player in asymmetric organogenesis. Mice lacking asymmetric expression of PITX2 have TAPVR. I hypothesize that downstream targets of PITX2 in the heart stalk, likely to include PDGF-signaling molecules, mediate inflow tract remodeling and PV development. My long-term objective is to understand the genetic pathways that regulate inflow tract remodeling and the pulmonary venous connection to the left atrium. I propose the following specific aims 1. Characterize PDGF-signaling in the mouse heart stalk: define the temporal and spatial expression patterns of the PDGF receptors and ligands in the developing mouse heart stalk; determine the requirement of PDGF-signaling in heart stalk patterning and PV development using PDGFRA deficient mouse mutants; examine the cellular mechanisms underlying the leftward shift of the PV. 2. Identify PITX2-regulated genes during mouse inflow tract remodeling: define the expression pattern of PDGF-signaling molecules in Pitx2 mutants lacking an asymmetric enhancer; use these Pitx2AASE mutants to identify PITX2-regulated genes in the inflow tract and heart stalk by microarray analysis. A well structured career development plan, extensively supported with institutional resources and internationally known mentors, has been designed to allow me to transition during the tenure of the K award to an independent tenure-track faculty investigator. Thus, I will receive the necessary training both to direct an active research program and provide state-of-the-art clinical care. (End of Abstract)

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Most of our mechanistic understanding of how human cancer cells migrate and invade has been obtained by observing cell behavior in an artificial 2 D environment. Although progress has been made using this approach, important new evidence indicates that cell migration in 2 D systems does not completely recapitulate events associated with locomotion in a more physiological environment using reconstituted 3 D matrices and tissue explants. Work by others and novel evidence provided in this research proposal demonstrate invasive cells can utilize either a mesenchymal type of cell invasion that involves formation of an elongated invadapodia and a spindle shaped morphology or a primitive amoeboid movement that involves membrane blebbing though small holes in the extracellular matrix. These breakthrough findings prompted the hypothesis that cells are armed with different invasive programs that allow them to traverse complex tissues and colonize foreign sites in the body. Most importantly though these findings indicate that therapeutic prevention of this process in patients will require a multifaceted approach that targets both modes of cell invasion. It is crucial then that we identify invasive mechanisms utilized by disseminating tumor cells in vivo so that the appropriate therapeutic agent(s) can be designed to completely eradicate the spread of cancer in patients. However, tumor cell invasion is a complex and dynamic process that involves the intricate interplay between the tumor cells and the remodeling vasculature and stroma. Understanding this process in vivo has been difficult because it has not been possible to visualize this process in high resolution in live animals. To address this problem, we have developed a novel model of cancer progression that utilizes human cancer cells growing in optical clear zebrafish genetically engineered to express green fluorescent protein in all blood vessels. Using this model and dual color high resolution confocal microscopy, we discovered that the metastatic gene RhoC induces a rapid cell invasion process that facilitates cell intravasation through vascular openings induced by VEGF secretion. In contrast, mesenchymal cell invasion involves formation of elongated invadopodia and membrane integration into the vascular wall, but not cell intravasation. Our goal in the proposed work is to understand the signaling mechanism that control amoeboid and mesenchymal invasion as cells intravasate and how the vascular pores form in response to VEGF secretion. Based on our preliminary findings and the work of others, we hypothesize that the metastatic gene RhoC mediates amoeboid invasion through Rho kinase activity (ROCK) and myosin II-mediated contractility. We also hypothesize that PI3K harboring activating mutations found in human cancers induces mesenchymal cell invasion through activation of the FAK-Src-CAS-Crk-Rac signaling module, which facilitates actin-mediated invadopodial protrusion. We hypothesize that the vascular pores form through disruption of cell-cell junctions, which is regulated by src phosphorylation of VE-cadherin. Therefore, our overall goal is to examine in detail how RhoC and mutated PI3K signaling pathways regulate cancer cell invasion and intravasation and the molecular signaling mechanisms that control vascular pore formation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer cells spread throughout the body by invading into blood vessels where they are carried to distant organs and form secondary tumors. Work in this proposal will determine the mechanism of how cancer cells invade through the vessel wall utilizing high resolution confocal imaging of optically transparent zebrafish harboring metastatic human cancer cells.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Craniofacial birth defects represent devastating psychosocial complications as well as a significant socioeconomic burden. Among them, cleft palate posed an annual ""national bill"" exceeding $100 million in 2004 in direct hospital costs alone and is highly prevalent as the incidence is roughly 0.1% (one in 1000 children), making it the second most common birth defect. Previous studies indicate that the pathogenesis of cleft palate is multifactorial and likely has both genetic and environmental factors. Much of our knowledge of craniofacial clefting arises from case studies of patients and although limited, selected animal models. A number of genes have been identified to be associated with the cleft palate phenotype, but the etiology of the majority of cases remains elusive. Affected children require multiple operations to address not only palate closure, but also associated problems with speech, feeding, dentition, and other craniofacial growth deficiencies. The function of GSK-32 has previously been shown to be intimately related to and necessary for normal craniofacial development. The central hypothesis of this application is that signal transduction pathways dependent on GSK-32 control the development of the secondary palate. This proposal will use genetic analysis and novel protein regulation techniques to study the roles of GSK-32 in palate formation. Two Specific Aims are proposed to explore the roles of GSK-32 in palatogenesis and fusion. The first aim will address the mechanistic requirements of GSK-32 signaling in palatogenesis while the second aim brings a new technique to control levels of GSK-32 protein to the study of palate development. In the first aim, the mechanism(s) underlying the cleft of the secondary palate in GSK-32 mutant mice will be explored. Palatal shelves in this mutant have previously been shown to develop seemingly appropriately during embryogenesis, but fail to fuse. This deficiency may be the result of defective palatal shelf growth, cell apoptosis and/or transdifferentiation, and the first part of this aim will look in vivo to investigate markers of these processes during palatogenesis in mutant compared to the wild-type palates. In the second part, in vitro organ culture will be used to determine if the mutant palateal shelves are capable of fusion when placed in apposition in organ culture. In the second aim, the study of palatogenesis using a drug-dependent GSK-32 allele during distinct stages will be undertaken. Because GSK-32 is required at different times in different regions, complete early loss of its activity may preclude study of its action at a downstream time and location   for example, growth and fusion events in the palate after defective maxillogenesis. This system is novel and requires further investigation and adaptation to in vitro protocols. Taken together, these two aims will pinpoint the spatial and temporal requirements of GSK-32 signaling and greatly advance our knowledge of the mechanistic causes of human orofacial clefting. Furthermore, the new protein regulation techniques that we develop will serve as a template for future developmental studies.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children and families affected by cleft palate must not only endure multiple, physiologically challenging surgeries to address palate closure, but also associated problems with speech, feeding, dentition, and other facial growth deficiencies. In addition, cleft palate brings with it devastating psychosocial implications for many children as well as significant socioeconomic burden exceeding $100 million in direct hospital costs alone. These facts are significant and while certain genes and environmental factors have been associated with the development of cleft palate, the cause in the majority of cases remains unknown and further study is extremely important.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations in the human BMP4 and BMP2 genes have been associated with osteoporosis and these BMPs signal through a variety of BMP receptors. The role for BMP2 and BMP4 in bone biology is limited since deletions of BMP4 and BMP2 are embryonic lethals. Data from our lab has shown that conditional knock-out of BMP4 in matrix producing osteoblasts, using Cre/loxP, results in postnatal animals with an osteopenic phenotype. BMP4 cKO mice have decreased osteoblast activity and increased osteoclasts in older animals. We have recently shown that the Shh responsive gene, Gli2, directly regulates BMP2 expression and transcription in osteoblast precursors through Gli response elements. Our hypothesis is that BMP4 and BMP2 are required at early mesenchymal precursor cells to drive the precursors to a commitment osteoblast stage before expansion and differentiation to mature osteoblasts. Further elevated BMP levels and signaling through BMP receptor 1A, is then required to drive the development of the mature matrix/mineralizing osteoblasts and osteocytes. We will test this hypothesis by selectively removing BMP2 and BMP4 at two different osteoblast stages, the early preosteoblast stage and at later matrix producing osteoblast stage. We will then attempt to rescue some of these bone phenotypes by selectively activating one of the important BMP receptors in bone, BMPR1A. Specific Aim 1 will be directed at determining the specific and overlapping roles of BMP4 and BMP2 in osteoblast biology, using the Osterix-CreERt2 mouse model to temporally delete BMP4 and/or BMP2 in preosteoblast stage, specifically in animals after birth. Specific Aim 2 will be to determine the role of BMP2 and BMP4 in later stage osteoblasts, using the 3.2 Col1a1-CreERtm model to induce deletions after birth. Specific Aim 3 will be to determine the mechanism of action of BMP2 and BMP4 in vitro, using bone marrow mesenchymal precursor cultures in combination with BMP2 and BMP4 deletions in vitro with Adenovirus Cre. Growth, apoptosis, differentiation, and altered pathways will be determined, as well as gene expression patterns using microarray analysis. Specific Aim 4 will be directed at determining what aspects of the bone specific deletions of BMP2 and BMP4 are due to signaling through the BMP receptor 1A. This hypothesis will be tested using quantitative in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry. Western analysis of altered signaling pathways will also be determined in a quantitative manner. b-catenin/TCF and BMP signaling reporter mice and lineage marker mice will be used to determine levels of these pathways and alterations in the BMP2 and BMP4 deletion mice.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Leydig cells in the testis are the primary source of testosterone in the male. Our previous studies established three intermediate stages of the Leydig cell lineage in rats: a mesenchymal-like, highly proliferative progenitor Leydig cell (PLC), first observed at day 10-11 postpartum that is recognized as steroidogenic through histochemical staining of the marker enzyme 3(3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3|3- HSD); an immature Leydig cell (ILC) that has mitochondrial and smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane structures typical of steroid secreting cells but that synthesizes primarily Sa-reduced androgens rather than testosterone as end products; and an adult Leydig cell (ALC) that is proliferatively quiescent and terminally differentiated for testosterone secretion. A fundamental unanswered question is whether the ultimate source of adult Leydig cells is a small pool of undifferentiated, self-renewing stem Leydig cells (SLCs). The experiments in this application build on our recent identification and isolation of putative SLCs from postpartum day 7 rat testes. These cells do not express the Leydig cell markers LH receptor (LHR) or 3(3- HSD, do not synthesize steroids, are capable of at least 60 self-renewing divisions in vitro when cultured in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and upon appropriate stimulus, form PLCs that synthesize testosterone. Most importantly, when transplanted into Leydig cell-depleted adult rat testes, these putative stem cells repopulate the interstitium and later express 3(3-HSD. Building on these initial observations, we propose herein: 1) to identify the mechanisms that lead the neonatal SLCs to undergo renewal, commit to the steroidogenic lineage, and undergo terminal differentiation; 2) identify the cellular and molecular changes involved in the acquisition of steroidogenic capacity when Leydig cells differentiate from SLCs; and 3) examine the ability and mechanisms by which SLCs self-renew and differentiate in vivo when implanted into the testes of host rats. Throughout these aims we will ask whether SLCs isolated from adult animals retain the same properties of sternness observed in the neonatal SLCs. When completed, this project will provide both a line of defined cells that can be used by the research community to further understand the development of steroidogenic cells, and perhaps a new therapeutic tool for androgen replacement in hypogonadal and aging males.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  A central paradox in transforming growth factor beta (TGF-?) biology is how the same growth factor can induce such divergent responses as growth stimulation (i.e., mesenchymal cells) and growth inhibition (i.e., epithelial cells)? Considering the pivotal role TGF-? has in a number of normal and pathological conditions, addressing that issue is fundamental if we hope to develop specific intervention strategies. To that end, we have been investigating the general hypothesis that TGF-? stimulates cell type-specific signaling pathways as a means to regulate these phenotypes. One target with a critical role in coordinating the profibrogenic (i.e., mesenchymal), in contrast to the growth inhibitory (i.e., epithelial), cellular response to TGF-? is PI3K. During the previous funding cycle we have shown that PI3K represents a branchpoint in Smad-independent TGF-? signaling such that one arm leads to activation of Pak2 and c-Abl, while the other is coupled to Akt and mTOR. As this former finding has led to a multi-center Phase II clinical trial testing the efficacy of imatinib mesylate vs. placebo in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we will extend these concepts in the competing renewal using a variety of biochemical, biological, and morphologic approaches. First, we will determine the mechanism(s) by which TGF-? activation of mTOR stimulates stromal cell proliferation. It is proposed that greater efficacy and lower toxicity can be obtained in models of TGF-? driven tissue fibrosis by inhibiting both Pak2/c-Abl and Akt/mTOR branches downstream of PI3K. Second, the role of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) phosphorylation and receptor association in directing TGF-? target specificity and receptor activation will be defined. Third, a candidate protein has been identified which regulates fibroblast-specific TGF-? signaling, experiments are proposed to determine the mechanism(s) which prevents or promotes activation of these pathways in epithelial and mesenchymal cells, respectively. Answers to these questions are critical if the processes mediating cell type-specific TGF-? signaling are to be elucidated.    
Relevance to public health (lay language): TGF-? is a protein which can be either helpful or harmful to human health. While its ability to stimulate cell growth is important for normal wound healing, when unchecked the function of many organs can be disrupted by scar (i.e., fibrosis) formation. The proposed studies will identify/characterize targets which can be used to either increase or decrease this response.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cleft palate is the most common congenital craniofacial anomaly and occurs as an isolated defect as well as a component of syndromic and sequential disorders. Despite recent medical advancements, infants born with cleft palate often suffer multiple handicaps that significantly compromise the quality of their lives. TGF? plays a pivotal role in regulating the fate of the medial edge epithelium during palatal fusion. We have generated an animal model with conditional TGF?  type II receptor (Tgfbrfl/fl Wnt1-Cre) gene ablation in neural crest cells. These Tgfbr2fl/fl Wnt1-Cre mice demonstrate cleft palate and other craniofacial defects with 100% phenotype penetrance. There is normal CMC migration into the first branchial arch of Tgfbr2fl/f;Wnt1-Cre embryos, indicating that disruption of the TGF? signaling does not adversely affect the migratory phase of CMC. Therefore, TGF?-mediated gene expression is specifically required locally during palatal development.   
Recent studies have shown that TGF? signaling can negatively regulate the expression of Msx1 in cultured palatal mesenchyme (Nugent and Greene, 1998). Our initial analysis of the Msx1 promoter reveals multiple Smad binding sites with functional significance in mediating Msx1 expression in response to TGF? signaling. Using the Wnt1-Cre/R26R model, our preliminary data shows that there is a deficiency of CNC-derived palatal mesenchyme in Msx1 null mutant mouse embryos. The deficiency of CNC results from an elevated expression of CDK inhibitor p1$NMa and the disruption of cell proliferation. Taken together, we design studies to test the hypothesis that TGF? signaling regulates the expression of homeobox gene Msx1, which in turn controls the progression of cell cycle to regulate the fate of CNC-derived palatal mesenchymal cells during palatogenesis.   
In Specific Aim I, we propose to determine the effect of TGF? and Msx1 signaling on the fate of the cranial neural crest during palatogenesis by analyzing mouse embryos with Tgfbr2fl/f;Wnt1-Cre or Msx1 mutation. In Specific Aim II, we will attempt to identify and characterize the molecular mechanism by which TGF? signaling regulates the expression of Msx1. To determine the functional role of Msx1 in regulating the expression of cell cycle regulator p19INK4d to control proliferation and differentiation processes of CNC cells during palatogenesis.

However, it is still largely unclear how chondrocytes are able to maintain or modulate their phenotype to exert those fundamentally distinct functions. Runx2 and PPARgamma are two transcription factors that have received a great deal of attention recently. Runx2 is up-regulated in, and required for, chondrocyte hypertrophy and ossification, and PPARgamma is expressed in human articular cartilage and exerts anti-inflammatory roles. We have now found that both factors are expressed in epiphyseal and immature growth plate chondrocytes. Runx2 over-expression accelerates maturation, whereas over-expression of a dominant-negative (DN) Runx2 blocks maturation and leads to chondrocyte de-differentiation. The latter is seen also in chondrocytes isolated from Runx2-/- mouse embryos. In contrast, PPARgamma over-expression blocks maturation, while DN-PPARgamma over-expression favors maturation. Additional in vitro and in vivo data indicate that expression of Runx2 and PPARgamma is tightly coordinated and that the two genes have interdependent roles in chondrocytes. Our central hypotheses are: (a) Continuous and relatively low expression of Runx2 and PPARgamma  is needed for a stable chondrocyte phenotype; and (b) Runx2 up-regulation and PPARgamma down-regulation lead to chondrocyte maturation and hypertrophy. We will test these hypotheses by analyzing pre-natal and post-natal patterns of expression and activity of Runx2 and PPARgamma in articular and growth plate cartilages and cells. We will determine consequences of experimental manipulation of Runx2 and PPARgamma expression and activity in vitro and in vivo, including conditional ablation of each gene in chondrocytes at prenatal and/or postnatal points. Molecular mechanisms of regulation of Runx2 and PPARgamma will be tested, including possible direct protein-protein interactions resulting in complexes with altered trans-activating properties. The results of the project will shed novel and important insights into the molecular regulation of chondrocyte phenotype, and will suggest new ways to improve cell and tissue function during natural aging and pathological conditions of the skeleton and joints.","283958",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human studies suggest that retinol therapy in preterm infants ameliorates the morbid consequences of prematurity and conventional ventilation, which include alveolar simplification and subsequent chronic lung disease (CLD). Animal studies further reveal that retinol signaling regulates the processes that determine alveolar formation, but neither human nor animal studies have addressed the molecular mechanism by which either retinol amelioration or regulation occurs in CLD. Using a lamb model of prematurity, conventional ventilation, and subsequent alveolar simplification, we established that retinol therapy of conventionally ventilated preterm lambs (vitA+CV) permits alveolar formation that resembles the lungs of preterm lambs treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP; preterm control), and term newborn lambs (gestation control). Furthermore, vitA+CV or CPAP treatment permits expression of surfactant protein B (SP-B), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and p53 (a marker of apoptosis) versus CV treatment. A major novel advancement by our group is that a specific RARa agonist stimulates normal alveolar formation in the face of conventional ventilation in our CLD model. Our focus on molecular mechanisms will be on vitamin A regulation of genes for SP-B (direct regulation), VEGF (indirect regulation), and p53 (indirect regulation). SP-B and VEGF are co-expressed by alveolar type II cells in the lung; p53 is expressed by mesenchyme. The overall hypothesis, tested by the following 3 specific aims, is that vitamin A therapy permits appropriate alveolar formation through the classical retinoid signaling pathway and results in both direct and indirect regulation of downstream gene products. Specific Aim 1 will determine the rescue of alveolar formation by vitamin A in chronically ventilated preterm lambs. Specific Aim 2 will compare CV with or without RAR/RXR agonists versus CPAP with or without RAR/RXR antagonists to identify mechanisms of action of vitamin A. This aim will test the hypothesis that vitamin A signaling in our model occurs through RAR(/RXR. Specific Aim 3 will identify the molecular mechanisms by which vitamin A impacts SP-B, VEGF, and p53 promoter function. We will use lung cells isolated from lambs to recapitulate the in vivo findings, and transient transfection of stable cell lines to isolate specific mechanisms. We will test the hypothesis that the promoter regions of our 3 target genes are retinoid responsive. Thus, this project will provide novel mechanistic insights about alveolar formation and its dysregulation in CLD.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abnormalities of kidney and urinary tract development are the most common cause of chronic renal failure in children. While monogenetic renal dysgenesis syndromes continue to be unraveled, a sizable proportion of cases are sporadic and considered polygenic or a result of gene-environment interactions. During the previous funding period, we developed and characterized a unique mouse model of renal dysgenesis that is produced by defined gene-environment interactions. This animal model demonstrated that the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) is required for normal renal development under conditions of fetal stress. In response to gestational salt loading, B2R-null fetuses acquire a dysplastic renal phenotype characterized by excessive apoptosis, stromal expansion, and suppressed differentiated gene expression. Two independent lines of evidence support a central role for aberrant p53 activation in mediating the renal dysgenesis. First, the dysplastic kidneys overexpress a pro-apoptotic form of p53, P-Ser46-p53. Second, genetic crosses resulting in germline p53 haploinsufficiency rescue kidney development in salt-stressed B2R-null mutants. The long-term objective of this proposal is to elucidate the pathways leading to aberrant p53 activation and disruption of terminal epithelial differentiation in the developing kidney. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that induction of p53 in B2R-null embryos is kidney-restricted and is accompanied by activation/expression of upstream p53 stress-induced kinases. Specific Aim 2 will determine the direct role of P-Ser46-p53 in the pathogenesis of the renal dysgenesis using two complementary genetic approaches. The first involves p53 gene dosage reduction in the germline of B2R-null mice; the second, generation of B2R null mice harboring a mutant Ser46-to-Ala p53 allele. We postulate that, in both cases, the B2R-null progeny will be protected from the renal dysgenesis. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that P-Ser46-p53 suppresses differentiated gene expression through recruitment of histone deacetylases (HDAC) to the promoter regions of terminal differentiation genes. In addition, we will explore the potential therapeutic benefit of HDAC inhibitors in the restoration of terminal differentiation and halting progression of the renal dysgenesis. We anticipate that new pathogenetic paradigms and therapeutic strategies will emerge from our studies that can hopefully be applied for the treatment of renal dysgenesis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The continuous life-long production of all mature blood cells in the circulation and hematopoietic tissues is contingent on hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). These rare cells reside in the bone marrow of the adult and are the clinically important cells in transplantation therapies for blood-related diseases and leukemias. The manipulation of limited numbers of adult HSCs has been difficult, since ex vivo expansion of these cells has not yet been achieved. Despite the identification and use of many hematopoietic growth factors, HSCs can at best be maintained, not expanded. We hypothesized that at some early stage in ontogeny HSCs are generated and expanded in a unique embryonic microenvironment. An understanding of the developmental processes leading to HSC emergence in the embryo should provide novel insights and improved methods for the ex vivo expansion of HSCs for clinical use. To this end, our long-term research objective has been to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which HSCs are generated/expanded within the mammalian embryo. We have shown that the mouse aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region autonomously generates the first fully potent HSCs in close association with the aortic endothelium. We have demonstrated that Runxl and GATA-2 transcription factors are required for the generation and expansion of these HSCs. However, more factors have yet to be identified. In various preliminary studies of the AGM microenvironment, IL-3, BMP-4 and hedgehog factors have been implicated as effectors of AGM HSC emergence, but these factors must be further characterized. Thus, we will examine each factor for its role in the induction and expansion of HSCs in the midgestation mouse aorta. Using classical embryologic methods, we will deliver factors to whole cultured mouse embryos by bead/cell pellet implantation and transgenesis, to determine their effect on AGM HSCs. In similar factor manipulation experiments, we aim to establish the lineage relationships of precursors to AGM HSCs by dye marking of aortic endothelium. We will also investigate the long-term fate of the HSCs generated in the mouse AGM by Cre-lox recombination technology. If indeed embryonic aorta-derived HSCs migrate and colonize the adult bone marrow, our insights into their generation and expansion should lead to novel methods for clinical HSC expansion and thus, improve transplantation therapies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer cells adopt many strategies to maintain their growth and survival in their host. Some of these strategies allow the sustained growth of a primary tumor; others promote the process of metastasis. To metastasize tumor cells need to be motile, and to be able to cross the basement membrane which encloses blood vessels and organs. It is generally thought that basement membrane is degraded by extracellular proteases, provided by both tumor and host cells, that are activated by the tumor. In recent years, growing attention has focused on the role of specialized membrane protrusions called podosomes or invadopodia in control of basement membrane proteolysis. The outer surface of the podosome is rich in proteases, including those of the metallo-, serine- and cysteine protease families, which act to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM). We recently identified a Src substrate and adaptor protein called Tks5 which is localized to podosomes/ invadopodia in both normal and cancer cells. Reducing Tks5 expression with siRNA inhibits the formation of podosomes/invadopodia and invasion, even though proteases are still secreted, in keeping with the importance of this structure in the invasive phenotype. The mechanisms which control podosome/invadopodia formation are not yet well understood. We have found that incubation of cancer cells in 1% oxygen increased the formation of podosomes/invadopodia. Furthermore, podosome formation was prevented by treating the cells with anti-oxidants or the flavoprotein inhibitor DPI, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved. The level of Tks5 mRNA was upregulated by Src transformation, by hypoxia, and in cancer cells that had undergone an epithelial mesenchymal transition. Our hypothesis is that pro-invasive signal transduction pathways upregulate the level of Tks5, and that this in turn promotes podosome formation the production of ROS. Together, Tks5 and ROS increase the formation of podosomes/invadopodia and thus invasion. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1. to evaluate the transcriptional control of Tks5. 2. To elucidate the composition and role of NADPH oxidases in the formation of ROS. 3. To characterize the mechanisms by which ROS promotes invasion. The significance of this research is that it will increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which cancer cell invasion is regulated. The impact of the research lies in the opportunity to elucidate new molecular targets for metastasis control.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
This K23 application proposes a program of patient-oriented research training and studies that will apply novel techniques to investigate the mechanisms of gland proliferation in COPD. The longterm objective is to address persistent gaps in knowledge that prevent the development of novel and specific treatments of gland proliferation in COPD. The proposed approach will apply recently developed techniques for morphometry (design-based stereology), cell isolation (laser capture microdissection), gene expression analysis (two-step real time PCR) and a tissue culture model of gland development. Application of these techniques to bronchial biopsy specimens obtained by bronchoscopy will make it possible to study gene expression in submucosal glands isolated from well characterized human subjects. The specific aims of the proposal are to 1) To determine if submucosal gland proliferation occurs in non-fatal COPD and is associated with serous cell transdifferentiation and MUC5B overexpression. 2)To determine if submucosal gland proliferation in COPD occurs because of new gland growth from the surface epithelium. 3)To determine the role of EGFR and TGFalpha as inducers of submucosal gland proliferation in COPD. We propose two studies: 1) a cross sectional morphologic analysis of airway biopsies from smokers and healthy controls. Using design based stereology we will compare the volume of submucosal glands, the ratio of serous cells to mucous cells in glands, and the volume of MUC5B, TGFalpha and EGFR staining in the glands of smoker's compared to healthy controls. In addition we will quantify the number of terminal collecting ducts per surface area of basal lamina to determine if new gland growth occurs in smokers. 2) an experiment using bronchial biopsies in culture as a model for gland development. Using this model, in combination with morphometry, laser capture microdissection and RT-PCR, we will study the effects of TGFalpha and EGFR on the development of tubuloacinar structures in bronchial biopsy explants. The candidate will complement these studies with a curriculum of advanced training in molecular biology methods of clinical research.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the lowest incidence-adjusted survival rates of any form of cancer. Previously we demonstrated that tumor grade is the only consistent multivariate predictor of survival at our cancer center. Thus, the definition of factors regulating the transition from low-grade tumors to high- grade tumors should provide important insight into improved diagnostic avenues, including potential early detection screening and possibly targeted treatment, neither of which are currently available for PDAC. We have identified the hematopoietic tyrosine kinase syk as a marker of differentiation/tumor suppressor in PDAC. Syk is uniformly expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, as well as low grade PanIN's. Syk expression is maintained in low grade PDAC cells (G1,G2), irrespective of invasive capability, however syk is absent from high grade PanIN's and PDAC (G3), and syk expression correlates positively with patient survival. Syk has been described as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, with roles in overt cell signaling as well as indirect regulation of gene expression through HDAC binding and the Sp1 system. Our preliminary evidence demonstrates that in PDAC, syk is involved in ¿-catenin signaling, a known regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In support of this contention, stable ectopic expression of syk in syk-negative Panc-1 cells resulted in downregulation of the ¿-catenin-regulated gene products Akt and CD171 (L1-CAM), which are both overexpressed by these cells. Reciprocally, suppression of syk expression in endogenously syk-positive BxPC3 PDAC cells and immortalized normal pancreatic ductal epithelial cells results in de novo CD171 expression. Moreover, Panc1 cells expressing syk are growth retarded in vitro and in vivo, and exhibit enhanced sensitivity to both radiation and gemcitabine, the chemotherapeutic agent of choice in PDAC. We hypothesize that syk is a central mediator of the malignant phenotype in PDAC. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will identify genes important for syk-regulated PDAC progression by global genomic profiling of endogenously syk-negative Panc1 cells into which we have re-introduced syk, and reciprocally, using endogenously syk-positive BxPC3 cells into which we have introduced a dominant-negative syk, both in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, candidates will initially be screened using a bank of cell lines and promising targets will be verified using clinical samples. Importantly, since syk expression is lost in late-stage PanIN's, which are the likely precursors of poorly-differentiated tumors, reintroduction of syk into G3 tumor cells may identify previously unknown mediators of early changes in PanIN development and progression.

Transcription is one of the most important regulatory mechanisms controlling the stepwise program of epidermal differentiation.  Our research efforts have focused in characterizing the regulation and function of Dlx3 homeobox transcription factor, a member of the murine Dlx family, with essential roles in epidermal, osteogenic and placental development.
Dlx homeodomain proteins are a family of transcription factors that play crucial roles in developmental processes and differentiation of individual tissues. The Dlx3 gene is broadly expressed in the branchial arches and embryonic ectoderm, as well as in the tooth, hair follicle and interfollicular epidermis. To elucidate the functional role of the Dlx3 homeodomain protein during early development and during epidermal differentiation, we are currently in the process of determining the target genes and the Dlx3 interacting factors necessary to exert the transcription regulatory function. For the comprehensive analysis of Dlx3 gene expression throughout development, we generated a knock-in mouse carrying the reporter gene beta-galactosidase (LacZ) under the control of the endogenous Dlx3 promoter. Whole-mount or local X-gal staining shows the temporal and spatial expression of the Dlx3 gene in various tissues and organs including hair, teeth and bone. Targeted deletion of Dlx3 results in embryonic developmental arrest around day 9.5-10, associated with a gross failure of the placenta to undergo proper morphogenesis. It was not possible to assess the effects of Dlx3 loss of function on epidermal differentiation, since embryonic death occurs significantly earlier than the onset of epidermal stratification (E15.5). Recent work also showed that Dlx3 induction coincides with the onset of commitment to osteogenic lineage, as reflected by the induction of bone-related differentiation genes. Although Dlx3 had been implicated in skeletal development in the human autosomal dominant Tricho-Dento-Osseous  syndrome, where the mutation is associated with defects in craniofacial and endochondral bone, a direct role for Dlx3 in bone formation had not been identified. In a collaborative effort with Dr. Lian's laboratory, a regulatory role for Dlx3 in bone-specific transcriptional control during osteoblast development was demonstrated.
        During embryonic development and organ formation, a series of signals between epithelial cells and underlying mesenchymal cells, leads to the formation of a variety of appendages/organs. Anomalies in epithelial/mesenchymal-derived organs are characteristics of a group of about 150 human heritable pathological disorders defined as ectodermal dysplasias. DLX3 is among the few genes for which mutations have been directly linked with ectodermal dysplasias. The importance of Dlx3 in the patterning and development of ectodermal structures derived from epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during embryogenesis (i.e. tooth, hair) is corroborated by the effects of DLX3 mutations in patients with the autosomal dominant Tricho-Dento-Osseous syndrome. Recent research on the mechanistic role of Dlx3 in epidermal development and appendage formation has led to the important finding that Dlx3 is a direct target of the p63. This work presents the crucial finding that besides autosomal mutations in either DLX3 or P63 genes being associated with human ectodermal dysplasias, misregulation of DLX3 function is directly involved in the pathogenesis of ectodermal human syndromes associated to p63 molecular lesions.
	Furthermore, utilizing mouse models, we have determined that the selective ablation of Dlx3 in the epidermis results in complete alopecia owing to failure of the hair shaft and inner root sheath to form, which is caused by the abnormal differentiation of the cortex. Significantly, we elucidated the regulatory cascade that positions Dlx3 downstream of Wnt signaling and as an upstream regulator of other transcription factors that regulate hair follicle differentiation, such as Hoxc13 and Gata3. Colocalization of phospho-Smad1/5/8 and Dlx3 is consistent with a regulatory role for BMP signaling to Dlx3 during hair morphogenesis. Importantly, mutant catagen hair follicles undergo delayed regression and display persistent proliferation, and ablation of Dlx3 expression in the telogen bulge stem cells is associated with a loss of BMP signaling, precluding re-initiation of the hair follicle growth cycle. Taken together with hair follicle abnormalities in humans with Tricho-Dento-Osseous (TDO) syndrome, our results establish that Dlx3 is essential for hair morphogenesis, differentiation and cycling programs. In order to investigate the functional alterations caused by the mutated DLX3TDO isoform ex vivo, we used tetracycline-inducible osteoblastic and keratinocyte cell lines and calvarial derived osteoblasts in which the expression of DLX3WT and/or DLX3TDO could be regulated and monitored. Our results show that the transcriptional activity of DLX3WT is significantly reduced in the presence of the mutated isoform, indicating that DLX3TDO has a dominant negative effect on DLX3WT transcriptional activity.","967498",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Detailed understanding of developmental mechanisms is essential to diagnose and treat congenital malformations. A common group of congenital malformations are those that affect limb development. We have defined underlying cause of one such malformation, nail-patella syndrome (NPS) that affects the development of the nails, patella, and elbow. NPS is caused by mutations in the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor LMX1B. Our studies in the mouse have indicated that Imxlb is expressed specifically in the dorsal limb bud mesenchyme where it acts as a selector gene to specify dorsal cell fates. How Imxlb expression is restricted to and maintained in the dorsal limb bud mesenchyme is poorly understood as is the mechanism(s) by which Imxlb regulates dorsal-ventral patterning. In the proposed research we will address three main issues. First, we will employ conditional gene targeting of Imx1 b to determine whether specific subsets of mesenchymal tissues coordinate musculoskeletal patterning of the limb. Second, we will examine mechanisms that are responsible for the dorsal-specific expression of Imxlb by lineage tracing and transgenic analysis. Finally, we will test the ephrin/Eph signaling pathway as a candidate effector of Imxlb in regulating dorsal-ventral limb bud development. Taken together, these experiments will provide significant insight into how vertebrate selector genes function to coordinate regulation of a complex developmental program. Lmxlb activity is also required in other tissues of the body both during development and in the adult. From studies in mice and humans we know that Imx1 b is required for proper functioning of the kidney and outflow tract of the eye as well as for proper development of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems of the CMS. The proposed research will provide information about the function of Imxlb in limb development, but will also shed light into how Imxlb regulates kidney, eye, and brain development. As individuals with mutations in LMX1B are at risk for renal failure and glaucoma our research will also impact important heath concerns.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Malignant transformation of the breast and other organs is associated with dramatic changes in the microenvironment surrounding neoplastic cells, including a reactive fibrotic stroma characterized by increased production of inflammatory cytokines, excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), and an increase in tissue stiffness.  Contractile myofibroblasts are key mediators of the biochemical and biophysical properties of the fibrotic tumor microenvironment.  Additionally, the transdifferentiation of myofibroblasts from tissue cells and their subsequent activation is controlled by a combination of soluble factors and contractile tension.  The increased tissue stiffness associated with fibrosis may thereby generate a positive feedback loop to facilitate tumor progression and metastatic invasion; delineating the microenvironmental effects and effectors will require sophisticated, tractable model systems.  Here we describe the development of an experimental model that can define how alterations of biochemical and biophysical cellular microenvironment can stimulate myofibroblast development and activation, and how formation and activation of myofibroblasts in tissue structures affects progression to malignancy.  In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the biochemical and biomechanical requirements of the substratum microenvironment for the transdifferentiation process.  In Specific Aim 2, we will use a novel three- dimensional microlithography-based organotypic culture mimetic of the mammary epithelial ductal network to determine how myofibroblast transdifferentiation affects the microenvironment of the duct at the biochemical, mechanical, and cell population levels.  Given that the presence of fibrotic foci in breast tumors correlates with metastasis and negative prognosis, and might hinder the efficacy of tumor therapies, the new physiologically relevant models developed in this work will have significant impact for discovery and evaluation of novel therapeutic targets to combat fibrosis genesis and tumor progression.  PROJECT RELEVANCE: Repair of tissue damage involves the generation of specialized fibrous tissues that assist in tissue remodeling; deregulation or inappropriate activation of these repair processes can lead to fibrosis.  Increasing evidence suggests that tissue fibrosis is a significant risk factor for development of cancer of the breast, lung, and many other organs.  We present here a three-dimensional, microlithography-based model that can be used to break down the key steps involved in the earliest stages of fibrosis genesis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Diverse injury to the lung from endogenous as well as environmental factors or agents may result in a stereotypic response leading to fibrosis and end stage lung disease with a potential fatal outcome. The long term objectives of this project are to determine the mechanisms underlying the genesis of the myofibroblast in lung injury and fibrosis, and to characterize the functional phenotype and roles of these cells in pulmonary fibrosis. The myofibroblast is a key source of mediators and extracellular matrix whose expression in fibrotic lesions is markedly stimulated. Fibrotic foci composed of myofibroblasts and other fibroblast phenotypes are diagnostic of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a virtually fatal disease with no effective therapy. Hence understanding how these cells arise and the mechanisms regulating their survival may provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. A number of mediators are known to induce myofibroblast differentiation in fibroblasts, however recent studies suggest additional derivation from epithelial cells through a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The central hypothesis of the proposal is that mediator induced genesis of the myofibroblast is dependent on regulation by transcription factors and their cognate elements in the alpha-smooth muscle actin ((-SMA) promoter, and that expression of (-SMA has consequences on elaboration of other key elements of the myofibroblast phenotype and concomitant loss of epithelial phenotype in EMT. To test this hypothesis, four specific aims are proposed. First, transcriptional regulation of myofibroblast differentiation will be analyzed from the standpoint of (-SMA gene expression. Second, epigenetic mechanisms involved in regulation of this differentiation will be investigated. Third, the functional role of (-SMA gene expression will be analyzed with respect to its effects on key signaling pathways, gene expression, and cell survival/apoptosis. The role of (-SMA in inducing the cellular phenotypic features of the myofibroblast will be identified by examining the effects of specific inhibitors of its expression and ectopic or induced expression in cells not usually known to express this actin isoform. Finally, the specific impact of induced (-SMA expression on EMT will be examined by analysis of the effects on cellular signaling and expression of epithelial marker genes. The proposed work should reveal novel insights to understanding processes associated with the multitude of diseases known to cause fibrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE. The proposed studies attempt to uncover key biological processes that are important in the emergence of an activated fibroblast phenotype in fibrotic diseases of the lung, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and lung disease associated with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Thus the project is directly relevant to improving current understanding of these diseases, many of which such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, have no current effective treatment and often result in chronic lung disease with a fatal outcome. Such fibrosis or scarring may also affect lung diseases with increasing prevalence, such as asthma. Improvement in understanding these processes will provide much needed insight into potentially novel treatments as well as approaches for management of patients with these diseases.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The G12/13 family of G proteins couple to tyrosine kinase and Rho signaling pathways and regulate numerous epithelial cell functions. Epithelial cell tight junctions (TJs) provide the paracellular barrier and maintain polarity. Disruption of TJs is an early (and reversible) event in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, and loss of TJs initiates additional pathways contributing to progressive interstitial fibrosis. We have made a number of observations regarding the role of G proteins in the regulation of tight junctions. We are now extending these observations into the role of G proteins and their regulation of tight junctions in acute renal injury. We identified direct binding of Ga12 with ZO-1, a TJ scaffolding protein, and elucidated Ga12-Src mediated signaling leading to TJ disruption. In addition, Ga12 and Ga13 interact with PP2A, a phosphatase within the TJ critical for regulating TJ assembly. We hypothesize that Ga12/13 regulate TJs through tyrosine kinase and Rho pathways to mediate early steps in the renal injury response. Therefore, Ga12 and Ga13 signaling are key therapeutic targets for regulating TJs and the recovery from acute kidney injury. In MDCK cells, activation of Ga12 and Ga13 leads to loss of barrier function and delayed TJ assembly through distinct mechanisms. Hypoxia-treated MDCK cells show delayed TJ assembly, and activated Ga13 is detected in kidney lysates from hypoxic mice. Our goals are to define Ga12/13 signaling mechanisms leading to loss of TJs, and how these pathways are modulated with renal injury. In Aim 1, the binding domains and the mechanisms regulating Ga12/ZO-1 and PP2A interactions will be completed using in vitro assays. In Aim 2, Ga12 and Ga13 signaling pathways through Src, PP2A and Rho regulating TJs will be studied in MDCK cells. Ga12 will be silenced to determine if loss of TJs can be prevented, and Ga12/13 signaling investigated in models of injury (ATP depletion and ROS). In Aim 3, animal models of hypoxia, I/R and ureteral obstruction will be used to determine Ga12/13 activation of Src and Rho pathways in renal tubules. A mouse with conditional expression of activated Ga12 in proximal tubules will be used to determine how Ga12 regulates TJs and renal tubular function. Kidney cells are tightly connected to prevent waste in the urine from reentering the body. These connections are injured in kidney disease, and these studies will determine how these connections are rebuilt after injury. This will aid discovery of new treatments to prevent kidney failure.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Endothelial cell dysfunction (ECD), premature senescence and apoptosis are important contributors to capillary drop-out, glomeruosclerosis, tubulointerstitial scarring and progression of chronic renal disease. Previous studies showed decreased availability of nitric oxide (NO), decreased levels of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and glutathione (GSH), oxidative stress, and accumulation of peroxides as leading causes of ECD. Elevated levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) further compound ECD by inhibiting NO synthease. Preliminary Studies showed induction of a profibrotic phenotype of endothelial cells subjected to elevated levels of ADMA. NOS inhibition resulted in the in vitro and in vivo manifestations of the loss of differentiated endothelial cell functions and acquisition of myofibroblast phenotype. The concept to be tested and further developed in this proposal ascribes to NO deficiency and ECD-induced endothelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation the role of a trigger of 1) initial functional insufficiency of microcirculation followed by 2) structural phase of microvascular regression - prerequisites of tissue hypoxia and progressive nephrosclerosis. These goals will be accomplished through 1) elucidating profibrotic sequelae of NOS inhibition in vivo; 2) assessing the contribution of vascular non-perfusion and structural regression to glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial scarring; 3) investigations into transdifferentiation of endothelial cells as a potentially important contributor to vascular drop-out; its stimulators and mediators, like TGF-beta, angiostatin and endostatin; 4) detection and identification of intracellular proteins deficient in nitrosothiol modification, as a cause of the downstream endothelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation; and 5) attempts to ameliorate endothelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation, vascular regression and nephrosclerosis using an intermediate in NO synthesis, hydroxy-L-arginine, which combines the properties of superoxide scavenger and NO donor. These studies will be performed using established approaches for studies into cell physiology, renal morphology, proteomics, and renal physiology, all available to the investigative team. It is anticipated that proposed set of studies should provide a broad view on the potentially important mechanism of vascular regression in chronic kidney disease - endothelial-mesencymal transdifferentiation, its contribution to nephrosclerosis and therapeutic actions of hydroxy-L-arginine, which can ameliorate NO deficiency, accompanied by endothelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation and vascular drop-out, thus reducing progression of chronic renal diseases.

Lung disease is the leading cause of death in infants under one year of age and a strong relationship exists between human infant exposure to environmental air pollutants, increased respiratory infections in childhood and distal airway disease and asthma in adults.  We have asked how exposure to bioactivated environmental lung toxicants affects neonatal lung growth and maturation.  We have found 1) lungs of neonates are susceptible to acute injury by bioactivated Clara cell cytotoxicants at doses below the threshold for injury in adults and 2) once the acute cytotoxic injury occurs in neonates, repair is abnormal and incomplete, persisting even when the animals become adults.  In this renewal, we propose to 1) characterize the normal pattern of airway growth and development focusing on extracellular signaling molecules known to be involved in injury and repair in the adult, 2) evaluate how repair of acute Clara cell injury conflicts with active airway growth to inhibit repair and the normal pattern of airway growth and development.  We will use a comparative approach to discriminate the differences in normal growth and development when neonates are exposed to a P450-mediated toxicant.  We have developed methods for quantifying airway growth in very small animals and will use this in combination with genetic and protein analysis to define the role of extracellular signaling molecules in airway growth and repair.  This work will further our understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms by which environmental insults are involved in the origins of lung diseases that begin in childhood.","335023",

on the peritoneum within the pelvic cavity. The incidence of endometriosis is estimated to range from 30-
60% in women with pelvic pain and infertility and the associated health care costs are enormous.
Implantation of endometrial fragments at ectopic sites is thought to be regulated by cytokines and growth
factors secreted locally by immune cells as well as by the endometrial cells themselves. The infertility that is
often associated with endometriosis is due, at least in part, to alterations in gene expression in the eutopic
endometrium. These altered patterns of gene expression result in an endometrial environment that is not
receptive to the implanting embryo and cannot sustain its development. We have shown that a glycosylated,
trans-membrane protein called Extra-Cellular Matrix Metalloproteinase Inducer (EMMPRIN) is expressed in
both the human and mouse uterus and regulates production of metalloproteinases by uterine stromal cells.
EMMPRIN expression is upregulated in eutopic as well as ectopic endometrium of women and baboons with
endometriosis. Using a mouse EMMPRIN knockout model we have shown that in mice lacking EMMPRIN
expression, uterine stromal cells experience premature decidualization in response to oil injection and are
infertile. Treatment of cultured uterine stromal cells with EMMPRIN inhibits expression of decidualization
markers such as alkaline phosphatase-2 and induces expression of several cytokines and chemokines by
these cells. Thus it appears that EMMPRIN is a multi-functional regulator of endometrial remodeling. Our
specific aims are; #1: To determine how secretion of full-length, soluble EMMPRIN by uterine epithelial cells
is regulated and how EMMPRIN regulates production of cytokines, chemokines and angiogenic factors by
uterine stromal cells. #2: To determine how EMMPRIN regulates proliferation and decidualization of uterine
stromal cells and to clarify the intra-cellular signaling pathway used by EMMPRIN in these cells.
#3: To determine the effects of EMMPRIN on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of mesothelial cells.
The proposed studies will clarify the role of EMMPRIN in invasion of endometrial fragments through the
mesothelium leading to establishment of endometriotic lesions. They will also help to explain why aberrant
expression of EMMPRIN in eutopic endometrium could result in failure of implantation."," ",

the ability estrogen to promote the further proliferation of an initiated target cell population. However, since
the majority of breast cancers that do develop during this time lack appreciable expression of either the
estrogen (ER)or progesterone receptors (PR), this suggests that if hormonal changes play a part in
promoting breast cancer, they may not be doing so through direct binding to hormone receptor molecules
expressed by breast epithelial cells. Moreover, it is well established that ovariectomy prevents the formation
of both ER-positive as well as ER-negative breast cancers in women, further highlighting the importance of
estrogens in the development of ER-negative cancers.
 To reconcile this conceptual conflict we investigated the hypothesis that estrogen promotes the
outgrowth of ER-negative cancers by influencing host cell types distinct from the breast epithelium itself. We
utilized a novel xenograft mouse model in which the tumors that arise lack the expression of nuclear
hormone receptors, recapitulating the clinical situation described above. Despite lacking ER expression,we
showed that the tumors that develop in this model require circulating estrogens for their formation.
Moreover, we demonstrated that increasing the levels of circulating estrogens is sufficient to promote the
formation and progression of ER-negative cancers via a systemic increase in angiogenesis. Remarkably, the
systemic enhancement of neo-angiogenesis was accompanied by a striking increase in the recruitment of
bone marrow derived cells into the growing tumor mass, including endothelial and stromal cells. Based on
our evidence, we now propose to determine the mechanism by which estrogen effects bone marrow cell
recruitment, angiogenesis and tumor promotion.
 To this end, we aim to determine whether ER expression by the host is necessary for the stromal effects
mediated by estrogens, and whether these actions occur through the genomic or non-genomic actions of ER
signaling. In addition, we also aim to determine if bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are the targets of
estrogen-mediated angiogenesis and tumor promotion. This will be investigated through the use of ERKO
mouse models, bone marrow cell fractionation, and in vivo and in vitro functional assays to estrogen
signaling. Most recently, superior and more specific endocrine therapies targeting estrogen synthesis,
turnover, as well as genomic and non-genomic activities of the receptor have been developed, however they
are only utilized for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancers due to the lack of evidence these
compounds would work in ER-negative tumors. Thus, understanding the mechanism by which estrogen can
promote bone marrow cell recruitment, angiogenesis, and tumor growth would have significant and highly
relevant scientific and clinical impact for ER-negative cancers.","310650",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One (1) of the leading causes of hospital admission and mortality in the patients is heart failure and current interventional techniques often fail to treat the underlying cause of pathogenesis. Prevention of LV remodeling after acute MI is important because it causes heart failure and poor prognosis. The proposed strategy is based on the principle to supplement the inadequate intrinsic repair mechanism of the heart through stem cell transplantation. A potential approach to achieve enhanced bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSC) engraftment into the damaged myocardium is through mobilization of BMSC using hematopoietic growth factors. Various proof-of-concept studies in animals have shown the applicability of this approach using various myelosuppressive and chemotherapeutic agents and hematopoietic growth factors alone or in combination therapy. Recently, it has been reported that a pretreatment with cytokine(s), like G-CSF and SCF attenuates LV remodeling after MI. G-CSF also causes a marked increase in the release of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into the peripheral blood circulation, a process termed mobilization. The goal of our study is to pharmacologically mobilize cells and improve hemodynamic parameters and global cardiac performance. Based on our preliminary data, we postulate that mobilization of BMSC by various combinations of cytokines provides more efficient egress of the cells from bone marrow and that this process is dependent on specific lineage BMSC and chemokine receptor (CXCR4). 4 hypotheses will be tested in a well-established murine model using broad multidisciplinary approaches that will encompass diverse techniques including biochemistry, integrative physiology, immunohistochemistry, gene therapy, pathology, flow cytometric analysis, pressure-volume relationship and confocal microscopy. Hypotheses to the tested are: Hypothesis 1: Systemic administration of either G-CSF with SCF, or G-CSF with FL is superior to the use of G-CSF alone. We will identify and quantify the subpopulation of BMSC mobilized by G-CSF, SCF and FL alone or through the synergistic interaction between these cytokines to achieve lineage specific mobilization. Hypothesis 2: Ex-vivo delivered G-CSF and SCF transfected BMSC at the site of myocardial injury may efficiently trigger further mobilization and homing of BMSC for cardiac repair. This is based on the fact that G-CSF is an effective chemoattractant for BMSC and enhances the infiltration of side population after MI in mice. Hypothesis 3: The un-mobilized and cytokine mobilized bone marrow cells differ in the expression of their surface marker proteins, and this difference contributes to their emigration and release from bone marrow cells ""niche"". Hypothesis 4: Enhanced expression of CXCR4 receptor on BMSC accelerates their homing and survival in the infarcted myocardium. SDF-1 through its receptor CXCR-4 is believed to be superior in stem cell mobilization, angiogenesis and cell survival. This proposal is expected to yield novel information on various cytokine regimens to regenerate infarcted myocardium and the molecular mechanisms of HSC homing. The results of cytokine-mediated regeneration therapy may become a novel therapeutic strategy for MI.            .

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this research is to develop an improved, synthetic bone graft material for use in dentistry. The loss of teeth is often accompanied by the loss of jaw bone. Restoring this lost bone is often a prerequisite for the installation of dental implants and the maintenance of normal facial features. Calcium sulfate works quite well as a bone regeneration material. It serves not only as a defect filler, but is also biocompatible, conducts new bone growth and encourages the growth of new blood vessels. However, its fast degradation is its major shortcoming, restricting its use in bone grafting applications. Based upon a successful phase I feasibility study, this project proposes the development of a new material: a calcium sulfate/absorbable polymer composite with anti-inflammatory properties and bone growth factor delivery capability. Phase I studies have already demonstrated that calcium sulfate/ absorbable polymer composites undergo slower degradation than pure calcium sulfate and thus overcomes a significant drawback of this material as a bone regeneration product. The plan now is to develop a product that dentists can use in bone grafting procedures that will rival the bone regeneration potential seen with the use of the patients own harvested bone. The product, a composite of calcium sulfate and Poly-Aspirin that delivers a bone growth factor, PDGF, utilizes a new polymer whose in vivo bone response has been studied in several animal models. Because of its specific chemical structure, this polymer elicits an excellent cell and tissue response and has an anti-inflammatory effect of great value in the oral environment. Since an earlier version of this product has already been commercialized, this new product will be rapidly introduced to the marketplace and an improved replacement.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bone grafting is an essential component of facial and dental maintenance. Recent concern about allograft bone supply makes the development of a reliable, affordable synthetic essential to this process. This project describes the development of just such a synthetic with bone regeneration capability rivaling autografts based on a simple, affordable material with a long safety history, calcium sulfate, combined with an anti-inflammatory absorbable polymer and a bone growth factor.

The applicant has obtained research training in molecular and cellular biology, and completed her fellowship training in Neonatology, and now is a faculty member in the Division of Neonatology. This proposal will provide the applicant with the opportunity to expand her scientific skills through a unique integration of interdepartmental resources.
Her research will focus on understanding the role of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in normal and deranged lung morphogenesis. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a common long-term pulmonary sequelae of premature infants, is thought to arise as a consequence of developmental arrest of the immature lung in response to injury and abnormal repair. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)is a key negative regulator of branching morphogenesis and is increased in lungs of infants at risk for BPD. CTGF expression is
selectively induced by TGF-beta in fibroblast cells. Inhibition of CTGF synthesis or action can completely block TGF-beta stimulated fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis and induction of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), a characteristic marker of myofibroblasts. Our preliminary studies using a mouse embryonic lung explant culture model have demonstrated that CTGF inhibits branching morphogenesis, TGF-beta induces CTGF protein expression in mesenchymal cells and concomitantly inhibits branching morphogenesis. Blocking of CTGF
action with an anti-CTGF antibody attenuated TGF-13 inhibition of branching morphogenesis. Our hypothesis is that CTGF is a negative regulator of branching morphogenesis and mediates TGF-beta inhibition of branching morphogenesis. We speculate that inhibition of CTGF biological activity may be of therapeutic benefit to premature infants at risk of BPD. The specific aims are: 1). To determine the molecular and cellular responses involved in CTGF inhibition of branching morphogenesis in lung explant culture. 2). To evaluate the effects of blocking CTGF action or synthesis on TGF-beta inhibition of branching morphogenesis. 3). To investigate the role of CTGF in lung morphogenesis in vivo by over-expression of CTGF in airway epithelium of transgenic mice. The results of this proposal will expand our fundamental knowledge of developmental lung
biology and provide the foundation for experiments to evaluate the role of CTGF in an animal model of BPD. This may contribute new insights into the prevention and management of BPD. 
The proposed research training plan will also include participation in didactic courses, seminars, formal presentations at local and national meetings, as well as regular reviewing of the candidate's progress by the advisory committee. It is expected that this award will allow the PI to become an independent investigator in the area of perinatal lung biology.","131516",

During the previous funding period, we used a novel transgenic embryo explant culture system to show that epithelial-mesenchymal interactions play an important role in yolk sac hematopoiesis and vascular development in the mouse. Diffusible signals from visceral endoderm mediate these interactions and can reprogram hematopoiesis in a tissue (anterior epiblast) that is not fated to form blood cells. We identified two hematopoietic-inducing VE signals, Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP)-2, and found that they upregulate Bmp4 in explant culture. In the frog, the paired-type homeodomain transcription factor XMix.1 is induced by BMP4. Its ectopic expression in whole embryos transforms dorsal mesoderm to a ventral fate, resulting in formation of large numbers of blood cells. We cloned a mouse relative (mMix or Mixl) of the Xenopus and zebrafish Mix/Bix gene family and have generated a number of unique genetic models for analysis of its function during development. The single mouse Mix gene is expressed in the posterior VE prior to gastrulation and later in the primitive streak and nascent mesoderm in the gastrulating embryo. Although previous studies in the mouse embryo have pointed to a critical role for mMix in gastrulation, its function in the development of mesodermal derivatives remains unclear. Hematopoietic defects have been identified in differentiating embryonic stem (ES) cells in which mMix was genetically inactivated. We have recently discovered that conditional induction of mMix in ES cell-derived embryoid bodies results in acceleration of the mesodermal developmental program. A major finding to emerge from this work is that increased numbers of mesodermal, hemangioblastic, and hematopoietic progenitors form in response to premature activation of mMix. We hypothesize that mouse MX functions early in the recruitment and/or expansion of mesodermal progenitors to the hemangioblastic and hematopoietic lineages. In this application, we will: (1) identify the critical points in the mesoderm developmental program when mMix can regulate formation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells; (2) assess the developmental potentials of mMix- expressing cells and better define the surface antigens of the mesodermal progenitors for the hematopoietic lineage; (3) examine the consequences of deleting mMix function in mesodermal progenitors for the hematopoietic lineage in vivo. Characterization of mesodermal stem/progenitor cell populations and elucidation of the common as well as the distinguishing features of embryonic versus adult hematopoietic and vascular development will be of fundamental importance and may also advance our ability to modulate the self-renewal/differentiation of stem cells for therapeutic purposes.","423750",

Progressive fibrotic diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (usual interstitial pneumonitis) remain essentially an untreatable disease with a fatal outcome. Recent progress using microarray approaches have helped to identify previously unsuspected molecules that appear to play significant roles in fibrosis. Using such an approach preliminary data revealed induction of a recently discovered molecule termed FIZZ1 (Found in Inflammatory Zone 1) in a rodent model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. This was the most highly induced molecule using a 10k rat gene chip, which was confirmed by RT-PCR to be >30-fold induced over control lung. FIZZ1, also known as resistin-like molecule alpha (RELM-alpha) is also highly expressed in inflamed airway epithelium in allergic airway disease, but its function remains unclear. Preliminary evidence in the bleomycin model confirms localization of expression mainly to be in airway and alveolar epithelium, which was confirmed by analysis of isolated type II pneumocytes. Lung fibroblasts however appear not to express FIZZ1. Co-culture of such FIZZ1 expressing type II pneumocytes with fibroblasts induced their differentiation to myofibroblasts. Based on these preliminary data, the central hypothesis of this project is that induction of FIZZ1 expression by alveolar epithelial cells plays a role in the
pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis by inducing myofibroblast differentiation. To test this hypothesis four Specific Aims are proposed. First, the kinetics of alteration in lung FIZZ1 expression will be determined in the bleomycin model, and the cellular localization of expression attempted using a combination of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Confirmation of cellular expression will be undertaken in vitro in isolated and purified lung cells. Second, to analyze its biological activity vis-&-vis fibrosis, co-culture studies will be undertaken between FIZZ1 expressing type II pneumocytes and non-expressing lung fibroblasts to see if crosstalk between the alveolar epithelium and the fibroblast is mediated by FIZZ1. Confirmation of any
activity will be undertaken using a FIZZ1 expressing plasmid for transfection studies using lung fibroblasts, and for the production of recombinant FIZZ1. Third, regulation of FIZZ1 expression in type II cells and associated signaling pathways will be analyzed. Finally, FIZZ1 knockout mice will be generated, and siRNA approaches used to confirm the in vivo relevance of its in vitro activity."," ",

We have identified ets-2 as a nuclear target of ras pathways that can persistently activate gene expression, and more recently have demonstrated that ets-2 can also repress gene expression in a signaling-dependent fashion. Gene targets include members of the EGF ligand family, such
as HB-EGF, as well as a group of extracellular proteases including urokinase plasminogen activator, stromelysin 1/MMP3, MMP9 and MMP-MT1. The identity of these target genes suggests that the ras/ets-2 pathway may be activated during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition that occurs in the tumor cell and coincides with a more metastatic phenotype. However, these target genes are also expressed in other types of cells in the tumor microenvironment during tumor progression, particularly in macrophages and stromal fibroblasts. This leads to the proposition that the ras/ets-2 pathway may be activated in several cell types in the tumor microenvironment and may play distinct roles in different stages of tumor progression. We propose to use conditional gene knockout approaches to remove ets-2 in macrophages and stromal fibroblasts in the mammary tumor microenvironment. We also propose to develop orthotopic mouse models that will allow us to study the role of ets-2 stromal fibroblasts during tumor metastasis. In combination with the other two Projects in this Program Project Grant, we will also study interactions between the ras/ets-2, Pten and Rb/E2F pathways. These experiments will give us a better understanding of the role of the ras/ets-2 pathway in coordinating expression of genes in a temporal and spatial specific pattern during mammary tumor progression.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each year, more than one million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed worldwide, and an estimated 370,000 women die from breast cancer. The vast majority of fatal breast cancer cases involve metastatic spread of the primary tumor, but the metastatic process remains a complex and poorly understood process. Our long-range goal is to identify the molecular mechanisms of breast cancer progression from solitary tumor to metastasis. Based on our extensive molecular analysis of clinical human breast cancer specimens and a series of experimental breast cancer models, we now propose to test the following central hypothesis: Loss of activation of transcription factor Stat5 is a cancer progression event that favors epithelial-to-mesenchymal dedifferentiation, invasiveness, and increased metastatic potential of breast cancer cells. To accomplish the objectives of this application, we will pursue three specific aims:  
Aim #1: Analyze 1,300 human breast cancer specimens to establish the relationship between levels of active Stat5 and measures of tumor cell invasiveness.  
Aim #2: Establish whether Stat5 stimulates human breast cancer cell differentiation and adhesion, and suppresses tumor cell invasion, in vitro and in vivo.  
Aim #3: Determine the effect of Stat5 activation on invasion and metastasis of mouse breast cancer models in vivo.  
Our expectations are that by the end of the proposed project period, we will have established whether Stat5 activation status in breast cancer is a useful clinical predictor of disease progression and clinical outcome in lymph node-negative breast cancer. This is important because active Stat5 may serve as a simple immunohistochemical marker to identify node-negative breast cancer patients with excellent prognosis, permitting more individualized treatment, including selection of antiestrogen therapy. The results of this work could lead to new preventative and therapeutic strategies for primary and metastatic breast cancer.

associated with severe skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular complications including death due to ruptured
aortic aneurysms. Our prior work has shown that many manifestations of MFS are caused byexcessive
activation of and signaling by TGFbeta, a family of growth factors that regulate cell performance and survival.
Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a newly recognized and apparently common disorder caused by mutations in
either of the two genes that encode the TGFbeta receptor (TBR). MFS and LDS are intimately related
conditions, both in terms of clinical manifestations and pathogenetic mechanisms. We believe that the
integrated study of both disorders will be particularly powerful. Our foundations derived from prior study of
mouse models of MFS will provide a meaningful context within which to interpret newly created animal
models of LDS. This will include a dedicated assessment of the lung, bone, skeletal muscle, aorta, and valve
leaflets in TBR-deficient animals, both with and without treatment with TGFbeta neutralizing antibody. In
contrast to MFS (where signaling defects are initiated by matrix perturbations), the cell-autonomous nature of
the defect in LDS will allow rapid and definitive evaluation of other potentially relevant pathogenetic events
(including altered angiotensin II (Angll), p38, ERK1/2 and JNK signaling) using cell culture systems and
pathway-specific pharmacologic antagonists; positive results will allow for hypothesis-driven interrogation of
tissues derived from Marfan mice and patients. We will evaluate for genetic interactions in TBR mutant
animals that are also deficient for fibrillin-1 or that conditionally overexpress Smad7, a natural inhibitor of
TGFbeta. These data will help to segregate features of MFS that manifest either structural or regulatory
(TGFbeta-related) deficiencies of fibrillin-1. Mouse studies will compare the efficacy of treatment with a beta-
adrenergic receptor blocker (that lowers hemodynamic stress) with that for losartan (that both lowers
hemodynamic stress and antagonizes TGFbeta) in the treatment of LDS, a devastating disorder associated
with vessel rupture and death in early childhood. Results will inform our linkage effort to identify genetic
modifiers of the MFS using exceptional pedigrees that show discrete variation in disease manifestations.
Taken together, these data will facilitate the development of novel and rational therapeutic strategies.","343331",

University, with the goal of becoming a physician-scientist and principal investigator conducting basic
biomedical investigation in an interdisplinary research environment at a leading academic medical center. As
a post-doctoral fellow, I am studying how indigenous gut microbes affect host biology. Using methods that
allow germ-free (GF) normal and genetically manipulated mice to be treated with irradiation and bone
marrow transplantation, I found that the microbiota influences sensitivity to radiation enteritis, a limiting factor
for radiotherapy of abdominal and pelvic cancers. This proposal uses a series of novel gnotobiotic normal,
knockout and chimeric mouse models to dissect the cellular and molecular pathways by which the microbiota
modulates the radiosenstivity of intestinal endothelial and immune populations in the villus mesenchyme . In
specific aim 1, the microbial and host components of gut radiosensitivity will be determined, using gnotobiotic
mice from specified genetic backgrounds colonized with defined collections of bacteria that receive defined
doses of total body irradiation. Mice will be assessed by survival, histochemical, and immunohistochemical
analyses, plus functional genomic studies of gene expression from laser capture microdissected villus
epithelial and mesenchymal cell populations. Aim 2 uses gnotobiotic transgenic/knockout and chimeric
mice, plus recombinant protein, to elucidate the role of a gut epithelium-derived member of the angiopoietin
family, Fiaf, in the Gl radioresponse. Aim 3 employs 'radiation chimeras' (transplanting bone marrow from
knockout mice into syngeneic normal or genetically engineered GF recipients) to further assess the cellular
and molecular circuitry that shapes the radiosensitivity of the intestine - specifically focusing on the
interaction between lymphocytes and endothelial cells. LAY SUMMARY: New research that illuminates
novel features of the host-microbial relationship in the gut will be invaluable in developing directed therapies
for radiation enteritis and other diseases that afflict the Gl tract. Furthermore, because of the central role for
endothelial cell damage in a wide number of disease processes within the intestine and other organs, I
expect to obtain insights about endothelial responses to injury that are applicable to the cardiovascular
system where endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in disease pathogenesis.","121138",

Invasion and metastasis are the most lethal characteristics of breast cancer and the leading cause of breast cancer-related death. TGF-beta normally inhibits breast cancer development by preventing mammary epithelial cell (MEC) proliferation, or by inducing MEC apoptosis. Mammary tumorigenesis negates the tumor suppressing activities of TGF-beta, thus facilitating TGF-beta to stimulate breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Fundamental gaps exist in our knowledge of how malignant MECs overcome the cytostatic actions of TGF-beta, and of how TGF-beta stimulates the development and progression of mammary tumors. These knowledge gaps have prevented science and medicine from developing treatments effective in antagonizing TGF-beta oncogenicity in developing and progressing breast cancers. We identified the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin C (CystC) as a novel TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaR-II) antagonist that inhibits TGF-beta -stimulated gene expression, cell invasion, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and morphological transformation in normal and cancer cells. Based on these and other preliminary findings, we hypothesize that delivering CystC (or CystC peptide mimetics) to developing breast cancers that are resistant to the cytostatic actions of TGF-beta will antagonize TGF-beta oncogenicity by (i) preventing TGF-beta binding to TbetaR-II; (ii) reducing TGF-beta: TbetaR-II binding to TaR-III and TbetaR-I; and (iii) selectively inhibiting Smad2/3-independent signaling pathways activated by TGF-beta. This hypothesis will be addressed by three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will identify the CystC and TbetaR-II determinants that mediate CystC: TbetaR-II complex formation and mutants lacking these functions will be used to establish the role of CystC in selectively antagonizing TGF-beta isoform signaling in normal and malignant MECs. Specific Aim 2 will determine the TGF-beta signaling systems selectively inhibited by CystC, the mechanisms underlying these inhibitory reactions, and the impact of these reactions on TGF-beta function in normal and malignant MECs. Specific Aim 3 will determine whether CystC antagonizes TGF-beta oncogenicity and breast cancer progression in vivo by measuring the effects of CystC in preventing TGF-beta to stimulate breast cancer cell growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and to therapeutically combat these tumor behaviors in nude mice. These studies will provide valuable information on how TGF-beta promotes breast cancer invasion and metastasis, and, more importantly, on how to control these deadly processes by combating the oncogenicity of TGF-beta through the development and use of CystC-based TbetaR-II antagonists.","255871",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dedifferentiation and enhanced proliferation and motility of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are key elements in the pathogenesis of many vascular diseases. Thus, a detailed understanding of the development of the VSMC layer of normal blood vessels promises to provide critical insights into vascular disease. However, the processes underlying the morphogenesis of any specific vessel or vascular bed are not well understood. The central goal of this proposal is to elucidate the key molecular and cellular events encompassing the morphogenesis of the smooth muscle cell (SMC) layer of the left pulmonary artery during the initial four days of murine lung development. This goal is the first step towards the long term objective of delineating the critical events in the building of all layers of the pulmonary artery throughout development.   
  
An essential element of achieving these goals is to characterize the roles specific signaling pathways play in pulmonary artery development. Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary artery hypertension and restenosis following coronary artery angioplasty; yet, the specific effects of PDGF signaling in these diseases or in the morphogenesis of large vessels remain elusive. I hypothesize that signaling through the PDGF pathway is critical for the maintenance, proliferation and/or recruitment of a multipoint early lung mesenchymal cell population that has the capacity to differentiate into the SMC layer of the left pulmonary artery.   
  
The proposal has three specific aims: 1) establish a timeline of molecular markers and cellular events that identify specific stages during the transition of a murine lung mesenchymal cell into a differentiated left pulmonary artery SMC and relate this timeline to'endothelial cell and non-vascular tissue development; 2) identify the pattern and effects of activation of PDGF receptor-mediated signaling pathways in left pulmonary artery SMC development; 3) determine the fate in the lung of early PDGF receptor-beta-positive mesenchymal cells through lineage analysis. To achieve these aims, lungs will be dissected from wildtype and transgenic mouse embryos and subjected to whole mount immunostaining, in situ hybridization or X-gal staining. In selected experiments, embryonic lungs will be cultured prior to analysis. Confocal microscopy will be used to analyze fluorescent stains on a cellular level.  
  
In sum, the proposed work will make the left pulmonary artery the best understood example of morphogenesis of a specific blood vessel. These studies will yield critical insights into the mechanisms underlying prevalent vascular diseases such as coronary artery atherosclerosis. In addition, this work promises to advance the investigation of critically understudied disorders of smooth muscle cell physiology in the lung, such as pulmonary artery hypertension and lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Lower back pain, of which disc degeneration is a major cause, is the primary cause of disability in the United
States. Costs related to low back pain are estimated to exceed $100 billion per year. Cell based tissue
engineering therapies could provide major relief to those suffering severe disc disease. Developmental biology
is the study of how cells with specialized functions are derived from undifferentiated cells and how cells interact
with each other and their environment to ultimately form mature tissues and organs. Therefore, it is important
to understand the basic mechanisms of development biology in the skeleton if we are to make progress in
engineering skeletal tissue. This project represents a partnership between developmental biology and
biomaterials engineering that will provide a basis for future strategies aimed at disc repair or regeneration.","NIAMS","7587216","8/29/2008 12:00:00 AM","RFA-AR-08-001","3R01AR053860-02S1","3","R01","AR","053860","02","S","WANG, FEI","4/18/2007 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","ZAR1-MLB-G(M1)"," ","1938450","SERRA, ROSA A.","Not Applicable","07","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","063690705","YND4PLMC9AN7","063690705","YND4PLMC9AN7","US","33.506935","-86.809252","1288803","UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM","BIRMINGHAM","AL","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","352940001","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2008"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","  
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developmental biology is the study of how cells with specialized functions are derived from undifferentiated cells and how cells interact with each other and their environment to ultimately form tissues and organs. Therefore, it is important to understand the basic mechanisms of development in the skeleton if we are to make progress in engineering skeletal tissue. Members of the TGF-ss superfamily are secreted signaling proteins that regulate many aspects of development and tissue homeostasis including growth, patterning, and cellular differentiation. Polymorphisms and mutations in human Tgfb genes have been associated with pathology in the adult spine and previously, we showed using genetically engineered mouse models that Tgfbr2 is required for development and maintenance of the intervertebral disc (IVD). Our results suggested that 1) TGF-ss is required for boundary formation in the developing axial skeleton and 2) TGF-ss prevents formation of cartilage and promotes the formation of IVD cells in embryonic mesenchyme. In this revision (supplement) application, we will test the hypothesis that gradients of TGF-ss and BMP have threshold effects on mesenchymal progenitors resulting in differentiation along either cartilage or IVD lineages thereby generating a sharp boundary between the two cell types in the axial skeleton. We propose to model TGF-ss mediated boundary formation and the pattern of cellular differentiation in the axial skeleton using a biomimetic self- assembled nanomatrix that can mimic essential properties of natural extracellular matrix (ECM). The nanomatrix is made from a synthetic peptide-amphiphile (PA) and contains the following properties: 1) rapid three-dimensional network formation at physiological conditions 2) cell adhesive moieties to provide cell attachment, and 3) enzyme-mediated degradable sites for matrix remodeling. The nanomatrix can be engineered to contain growth factors throughout the matrix or in a zonal/gradient pattern. Therefore, the nanomatrix can provide an environment that mimics the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be used as a template for studying tissue development. A clear understanding of how the skeletal system develops will have a direct impact on tissue engineering strategies. Partnerships like this, between developmental biology and bioengineering, will provide a basis for future strategies aimed at disc repair or regeneration.

adequate blood supply (angiogenesis). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a critical role in
angiogenesis and consequent ovarian cancer growth and progression. VEGF blockade has shown
promise in human studies. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop new strategies for targeting
blood vessels in ovarian cancers. Our pre-clinical results demonstrate that a novel approach (high-affinity
VEGF decoy receptor, VEGF-Trap) for VEGF blockade is highly effective in combination with taxane
chemotherapy. Recent evidence suggests that VEGF-Trap may be more potent than many other existing
modalities for targeting VEGF. Based on these encouraging preclinical results, we will conduct a Phase I
clinical trial of VEGF-Trap and docetaxel chemotherapy in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma in
Aim 1. In addition to endothelial cells, blood vessels consist of perivascular cells such as pericytes, which
are mesenchymal cells that wrap around the vessel tube. Several functions of pericytes relevant to
angiogenesis have been proposed including effects on endothelial survival, deposition of matrix, and
maintenance of vessel integrity. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (3 (PDGF-Rp) signaling is known
to play a functionally significant role in pericyte development and recruitment by endothelial cells. Aim 2
will examine the mechanisms by which pericytes provide a survival advantage for endothelial cells and
assess the efficacy of combinatorial approaches for targeting both endothelial cells (VEGF-blockers) and
pericytes (PDGF-blockers). Most chemotherapeutic agents are traditionally administered at maximum
tolerated doses. However, recently, metronomic chemotherapy (frequent administration of chemotherapeutic
agents at substantially lower doses with no prolonged drug-free breaks) has been utilized for
targeting endothelial cells of the growing vasculature of a tumor. Our preliminary data suggest that
metronomic chemotherapy alone and in combination with other anti-vascular approaches is highly
effective. Aim 3 will determine the efficacy of metronomic chemotherapy in combination with VEGF and
PDGF blockers. Thus, all three Aims are complementary to each other and"," ",

These sugars not only act as a protective barrier on the outside of the cell, but are also involved in cell adhesion, migration, communication and signaling events in many organisms.  Our group studies one type of sugar addition to proteins, known as mucin-type O-linked glycosylation, which is initiated by the polypeptide GalNAc transferase (ppGalNAcT or PGANT) enzyme family. This sugar addition is seen in most eukaryotic organisms including mammals, fish, insects, worms and some types of fungi. The conservation of this protein modification across species suggests that it plays crucial roles during many aspects of development. It is known that there are as many as 20 family members encoding functional ppGalNAcTs in mammals. Given the size of the family and the complexity it generates, we sought an alternative, simpler model system to investigate the biological role of glycosylation. Analysis of the genome databases from other organisms indicated that the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) had only 12 potential members and may therefore be a more tractable experimental system. Additionally, the fruit fly offers more sophisticated genetic techniques, shorter generation times and a wealth of well-characterized stocks on which to build future studies. 

We began these studies by cloning and characterizing the genes responsible for O-linked glycosylation in Drosophila. We demonstrated that there are at least 9 functional transferase genes in Drosophila (potentially 12 members total) and that at least one (pgant35A) is required for viability. These studies provided the first evidence that a member of this multigene family is required for development and viability in any eukaryote. Additionally, we defined the spatial and temporal patterns of expression of all the pgant family members throughout Drosophila development and elucidated the developmental profile of specific O-glycans. Of particular interest is the abundance of O-glycans along the presumptive apical and luminal regions of developing tubular structures in the fly.  

Examination of mutations in members of this glycosyltransferase family demonstrated that one gene is required at multiple distinct times during development. Specifically, pgant35A is required during embryogenesis; homozygous mutants devoid of wild type maternal RNA show abnormal tracheal tube formation and migration of secondary branches in developing embryos. This is particularly interesting given that the Drosophila tracheal system serves as a model for branching morphogenesis in many mammalian organ systems, including the salivary gland, lung, kidney and vasculature. We are now defining the subcellular changes that are taking place in pgant35A mutants.  Electron microscopy has revealed significant changes in the apical and luminal surfaces of the tracheal system, with loss of certain portions of the secreted cuticle and disruption of the taenidial folds that line the inside of the tracheal tube.  We are currently performing these studies in a cell culture system to visualize subcellular changes more readily.

In addition to pgant35A, we are also examining the developmental role of other members of this family. We have found that mutations in pgant3 alter epithelial cell adhesion in the Drosophila wing blade.  A transposon insertion mutation in pgant3 or RNAi to pgant3 resulted in blistered wings, a phenotype characteristic of genes involved in integrin-mediated cell interactions. Precise excision of the tranposon restored pgant3 expression and wing integrity.  Expression of wild type pgant3 in the mutant background also rescued the wing blistering phenotype, whereas expression of another family member did not, revealing a unique requirement for pgant3.  pgant3 mutants displayed reduced O-glycosylation along the basal surface of wing imaginal discs, suggesting that reduced glycosylation of basal proteins in pgant3 mutants is responsible for disruption of adhesion in the adult wing blade.  We have now identified one of the main O-glycosylated proteins in the wing disc using a combination of affinity purification, biochemistry and bioinformatics. This protein is specifically O-glycosylated in wild type wing discs but not in pgant3 mutants.  Interestingly, this protein is known to mediate cell adhesion events during other stages of fly development as well.    

We are also investigating the role of each transferase using RNA interference (RNAi) in vivo to knockdown the transcript levels of each isoform.  Expression of this dsRNA has recapitulated the phenotypes discussed above for pgant35A and pgant3 lending further support for the role of these genes in various aspects of epithelial tube formation and cell adhesion, respectively, as well as verifying the use of RNAi to specifically knockdown transferase gene expression in vivo. Interrogation of other isoforms by this approach indicates that additional pgant genes are required for viability.  We are continuing to systematically analyze the consequences of loss of each pgant family member both in vivo as well as in cell culture.

Given that this family is evolutionarily conserved and that mammalian and fly orthologues display similar enzymatic activities and substrates preferences in vitro, we are also investigating the role of O-glycans in mammalian organ system development.  We are currently interrogating ppGaNAcT expression patterns during embryonic salivary gland development using microarray data sets generated by Dr. Matthew Hoffman as part of the NIDCR Salivary Gland Initiative.  We are assessing the expression levels of each of the 18 mouse ppGalNAcTs during various stages of gland development to catalogue when each gene is expressed.  We are also examining whether each gene is expressed in epithelial and/or mesenchymal tissue, to assess what unique roles each enzyme may be playing in the development of this organ.  Preliminary analyses indicate expression of certain isoforms at key stages of glandular development.  Additionally, there are a number of isoforms expressed specifically in either the mesenchyme or epithelium.  From here, the functional role of isoforms will be interrogated using siRNA in submandibular organ culture.  Additionally, mice deficient in a number of ppGalNAcT family members already exist.  Because these lines are homozygous viable, we are using the organ culture system to examine the development of the salivary glands from these knockout mice.    

In summary, we are using information gleaned from Drosophila to better focus on crucial aspects of development affected by O-glycosylation in more complex mammalian systems. Our hope is that the cumulative results of the studies described above will elucidate why O-linked glycosylation is necessary and what role sugars play in cellular communication and interactions occurring during eukaryotic development.","1088260",

In development, cartilage serves as the template for the growth and development of most bones. ECM molecules, such as perlecan, link protein, aggrecan, and type II collagen, are expressed during chondrocyte differentiation. Mutations of these genes and regulatory factors result in impaired cartilage formation and malformation of the limbs, craniofacial bones, and appendicular skeleton. Cartilage formation is initiated by mesenchymal cell condensation to form primordial cartilage followed by chondrocyte differentiation, which includes resting, proliferative, prehypertrophic, and hypertrophic chondrocytes. As a final step in endochondral bone formation, hypertrophic cartilage is invaded by blood vessels and osteoblasts, and the calcified cartilage is subsequently replaced by bone. Thus, spatial and temporal regulation of chondrocyte differentiation is essential in determining the length and width of skeletal components. We focus on protein factors that regulate chondrocyte differentiation and endochondral ossification.

Although several factors have been identified as regulators for chondrocyte proliferation, it is still unclear how cell proliferation signals turn off and a commitment to differentiation is made. Pannexin 3 (Panx3), which we recently discovered, may be a candidate regulator for this process. We found that that Panx3 mRNA was expressed in the prehypertrophic zone where chondrocytes stop proliferation and are committed to differentiation into hypertrophic chondrocytes. Because of its unique expression pattern and potential gap junction function as a regulator for cell signaling, we hypothesized that Panx3 might control chondrocyte differentiation. We found that Panx3 expression was induced during chondrogenic ATDC5 cell differentiation into chondrocytes. Overexpression of Panx3 in ATDC5 cells promoted cell differentiation, whereas suppression of endogenous Panx3 by shRNA inhibited its chondrogenic differentiation in these cells. Panx3-overexpressing ATDC5 cells had increased release of intracellular ATP to the extracellular space via its hemichannel activity and reduced PTH-induced cell proliferation, intracellular cAMP levels, and phosphorylation of CREB, a downstream molecule of PKA that activates genes for proliferation. Our results suggest that Panx3 functions to switch chondrocyte cell fate from proliferation to differentiation by reducing the intracellular ATP/cAMP levels.

TGF-beta regulates chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation. However, its in vivo function in cartilage development is not clear because of its diverse activities and redundant expression of multiple TGF-beta proteins. To define the precise role of TGF-beta signaling in cartilage development, we created conditional knockout (CKO) mice for ALK-5 (a type I receptor for TGF-beta). Chondrocyte-specific ALK-5 deficiency mediated by Col2a1-Cre caused severe defects in the axial cartilage in the spine and skull, while appendicular cartilage was relatively normal. The formation of intervertebral disks was defective, and segmentation of the upper vertebrae was disrupted. Although chondrocytes were differentiated, expression of extracellular matrix and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) levels were reduced. Perichondrium cells migrated into cartilage at the herniation site, suggesting reduced strength of mutant cartilage. We also created Dermo1-Cre-mediated ALK-5 CKO mice, in which Dermo-Cre is expressed in the progenitor mesenchyme. Mutant mice had similar axial skeletal abnormalities but more severely impaired appendicular skeletal elements. The mice developed multiple ectopic cartilaginous protuberances in growth plates and joint fusions. The perichondrium and periosteum were thin, and bone collar formation and endochondral ossification were reduced. These results suggest that TGF-beta signaling promotes chondrocyte proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis and is required for the osteoblastic cell lineage.

We found that the newly discovered dentin matrix molecule TM14 (fibulin-7) was expressed not only in teeth but also in cartilage. In situ hybridization revealed that TM14 mRNA was expressed in articular and proliferating chondrocytes, and in the perichondrium of growth plates. The TM14 protein was localized in the pericellular region of chondrocytes distinct from other cartilage matrix, such as type II collagen. We found that TM14 was induced during differentiation of chondrogenic ATDC5 cells. These results suggest that TM14 may play a role in chondrogenesis.","895934",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism governing vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from neural crest stem cells (NCSCs). Abnormal VSMC differentiation contributes to a number of major cardiovascular disorders including the most prevalent forms of congenital heart disease (CHD). Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that TGF- signaling is critical for VSMC differentiation from NCSCs. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the complex activities of TGF- on this process remain largely unknown. By utilizing in vitro model systems we found that the TGF- downstream intermediate Smad2, but not Smad3, is critical for TGF--induced VSMC differentiation from NCSCs; while Smad3, but not Smad2, is important for VSMC differentiation from mesenchymal- originated (non-NCSC) C3H10T1/2 cells. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that Smad2 acts as an important and specific mediator of TGF- in VSMC differentiation from NCSCs. More importantly, we made the novel observation that Smad2, but not Smad3, is required for VSMC marker gene activation in NCSCs. We also found that myocardin-related transcription factor B (MRTFB) contributes to VSMC specific gene activation in NCSCs. To investigate the mechanism by which TGF- regulates VSMC differentiation from NCSCs, we will focus on two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will study the molecular mechanisms underlying the Smad2 function in VSMC differentiation from NCSCs. We will determine how Smad2 regulates transcriptional activation of VSMC marker genes, and determine if Smad2 interacts with MRTFB in controlling marker gene promoters. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that Smad2 is essential for VSMC differentiation from NCSCs in vivo, using a neural crest tissue-specific knockout (Wnt1-Cre) mouse. The specificity of Smad2 in NCSCs will be further tested by mutating Smad2 gene in VSMC of non-NCSC origins by using a SM22-Cre mouse. NCSC differentiation is a complex process modulated by multiple factors, including TGF- and its family members. Through a combination of biochemical, molecular, cellular and developmental biological techniques, the function of Smad2 in VSMC differentiation will be thoroughly studied. Accomplishment of the proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which TGF- regulates NCSC differentiation to VSMC and contribute to the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of human cardiovascular diseases including CHD. Moreover, since Smad2 is specific to the VSMC differentiated from NCSC while Smad3 is specific to the VSMC from mesoderm, our studies will likely provide new revenues for drug intervention specifically targeting at diseases that are caused by abnormal function of VSMCs from different origins. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Vascular smooth muscle differentiation is closely related to several major cardiovascular diseases including congenital heart disease. The proposed studies focusing on the function of Smad2 will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing the smooth muscle differentiation from neural crest cells. The results will shed new light on the pathogenesis of congenital heart disease and a number of genetic diseases such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 and type 2, which may ultimately lead to therapeutic intervention.

Each tissue forms a unique extracellular matrix (ECM) that changes with developmental age. Immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization, mass spectrometry, surface plasmon resonance spectrometry, knock-down and mis-expression analysis, ability to construct chick-quail chimeric embryos, and laser- assisted microdissection (LMD) now allow examination and manipulation of differentiation in small groups of cells in different parts of the eye to better assess signals regulating cell and nerve growth cone migrations and differentiation. Hypothesis: highly charged ECMs unique to each site, bind and release growth-, differentiation-, neurotropic-, and neurotrophic-factors that determine corneal transparency and innervation, and normal functions of other tissues. Aim 1: Determine carbohydrate structures and bound factors in key locations of embryonic eyes. Mass spectrometry will identify and quantitate specific glycosaminoglycans present in ECMs and details of their structures, including structural positions of sulfate groups and identification of sialic acid types. Aim 2: Determine the mechanism of each step in corneal sensory innervation by neural crest-derived growth cones of trigeminal ganglion neurons. Aim 3: Determine the normal lineage sources of non-myelinating Schwann cells of corneal stroma during development; identify marker proteins expressed by these cells and effects on their differentiation from perturbing ECM synthesis. Significance: Extent to which human corneas heal and become re-innervated after LASEK, LASIK, PRK or transplantation is determined by signals residing in participating ECMs, particularly in their posttranslational modifications. Although transplanted corneas generally remain transparent, re-innervation of the graft is very slow (years) and often incomplete, depriving patients of corneal touch sensitivity and blink reflex. Research proposed here will elucidate relationships between proteoglycan forms and distributions, and paths chosen by corneal nerves and non-myelinating Schwann cells during innervation of embryonic corneas. These data will facilitate designing strategies to better reinnervate transplanted or modified adult corneas.","347338",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are essential for many physiological processes, but inappropriate expression of MMPs can facilitate the development and progression of tumors.  Recognition of the relationship between MMPs and malignancy led to clinical trials of broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors as cancer therapeutics, but the results were disappointing.  The failure of the clinical trials was due in large part to the propensity of the MMP inhibitors to inhibit essential physiological processes.  Therapeutic strategies that target tumor-specific MMP-dependent effects may prove more promising.  Previous studies and our preliminary data show that exposure of mammary epithelial cells to selected MMPs causes cleavage of a cell surface molecule that stimulates cellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  MMP-dependent production of ROS causes cells to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a fundamental phenotypic alteration associated with progression to metastasis, and compromises the cellular genomic stability.  Our long-term objective is to identify the specific steps associated with the MMP-induced malignant transformation so as to determine potential points for therapeutic intervention.  To do this, we propose (1) to identify the proteolytic target of MMPs that stimulates the development of ROS, (2) to determine roles of transcription factors Snail and Twist in MMP/ROS-induction of EMT, and (3) to define how MMP/ROS stimulate genomic instability.  In Aim 1, investigations of the specific role of cleavage of E-cadherin by MMPs will be supplemented by a proteolytic screen for additional/alternative targets.  In Aim 2, we will identify the MMP-induced factors responsible for the increased expression of Snail and Twist, and will dissect the relative role of these transcription factors on the MMP-induced EMT.  In Aim 3, we will examine how MMP/ROS induce cellular aneuploidy and mitotic abnormalities through stimulation of centrosome amplification.  We expect that by elucidating the chain of events in the induction of EMT and genomic instability by MMPs, we will be able to identify novel promising points for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Fibroblasts mediate the abnormal tissue repair characteristic of fibrosis, but their origin in fibrotic lung remains unclear. Evidence exists for alteration of existing fibroblasts, influx of fibroblast precursors, and transdifferentiation of other cell types. Many of the fibrogenic characteristics of lung fibroblasts are regulated by expression of Thy-1, an outer membrane leaflet surface protein which modulates cell adhesion and migration via signaling alterations in lipid raft domains. Loss of Thy-1 expression is associated with oncogenic transformation and anchorage-independent growth. Our laboratory has established that absence of Thy-1 correlates with enhanced proliferative responses of lung fibroblasts to fibrogenic growth factors and altered cytokine signaling, whereas presence of Thy-1 inhibits the ability of lung fibroblasts to i) activate latent transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-(), a key fibrogenic mediator; and to ii) express alpha-smooth muscle actin. Thy-1 -/- mice develop more severe fibrotic remodeling of the lung, and fibroblasts in fibroblastic foci of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are predominantly Thy-1 (-). Inflammatory signaling causes shedding of Thy-1, activation of latent TGF-(, and transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. These findings support the hypothesis that loss of fibroblast Thy-1 expression is associated with a dysfunctional, profibrotic wound healing response in the lung. Preliminary data indicate that in addition to shedding, epigenetic regulation through promoter hypermethylation is an important mechanism for inhibition of Thy-1 expression. Furthermore, the majority of lung fibrocytes (bone-marrow derived cells which differentiate into myofibroblasts) are Thy-1 (-). Taken together with our previous work, these findings suggest that the regulation of Thy-1 expression, whether by shedding, transcriptional regulation, or recruitment of Thy-1 (-) cells, may present a novel therapeutic target for fibrosis. Thus the aims of the proposed studies are to: 1. define mechanisms for and consequences of Thy-1 shedding in the context of evolving fibrogenesis; 2. determine the roles of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of Thy-1 expression in evolving fibrogenesis; and 3. define the relationship between Thy-1 expression and influx of fibrocytes and other bone marrow-derived cells into lungs undergoing fibrogenesis. Each of these aims will be addressed in a vertically-integrated approach using in vitro studies, relevant animal models and well-characterized human samples.

The purpose of these experiments is to enable reconstitution and repair of the diseased, damaged, but developing fetal kidney, by transplanting healthy progenitor cells with the capacity to differentiate into cell types and tissue that will repopulate and reconstitute the affected organ. This is a novel and clinically relevant proposal. Work to date in the field has focused on describing changes in the fetal kidney when obstructed, but these efforts have largely been restricted to the postnatal rodent kidney. Our fetal monkey model of unilateral ureteric obstruction is arguably the best model available to study this disease and strategies to treat it. The proposal is driven by the fact that the clinical condition of fetal urinary tract obstruction is one of the most important conditions affecting young children with kidney disease. The work proposed in this application brings together the support and expertise of a number of leaders in the field of stem and progenitor cell biology, fetal kidney disease, and fetal models of disease and intervention. At the successful completion of the studies proposed in this Project we are hopeful that we will be poised to embark upon potential intervention trials in the human fetus with lower urinary tract obstruction. Presently in many centers across North America, fetuses are selected for invasive in utero fetal urinary tract shunting based upon antenatal maternal ultrasound imaging. The collective results of these interventions have been somewhat disappointing due in part to the non-standardized patient selection, to the inaccuracies of in utero diagnosis, and to an as-yet-complete understanding of the pathogenesis of renal damage in urinary tract obstruction. While in utero relief of the obstructed kidney during the critical time of nephrogenesis is necessary to optimize outcome, it appears that it is likely not sufficient. Experiments proposed using human renal progenitor cells in obstructed nonhuman primate kidneys brings us as close as we can to the next step of intervention in humans. These next steps will be guided by the results of this proposal and by the subsequent development of well-designed randomized controlled trials in human fetuses."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our long-term objective of this proposal is to gain an understanding at the molecular level of how the tumor microenvironment determines tumor growth and progression. Decades of cancer research has come to a conclusion that cancer is essentially a genetic disease acquiring dynamic changes in the genome. The development of cancer in humans requires a complex succession of genetic alterations over time, conferring selective growth advantage on cells undergoing progressive transformation. These genetic changes result in activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes for tumor development. Various DNA repair mechanisms safeguard the genomic integrity in normal cells by correcting mutations arising from myriad types of damage. Germline mutations of DNA repair genes have been linked to diverse types of hereditary cancers. However, no such mutations are generally found to be responsible for the development of sporadic cancers. Apart from tumor itself, the tumor microenvironment, hypoxia in particular, has been associated with increased genetic instability in cancers, presumably attributable to tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, even though the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We have recently shown that the hypoxia-inducible factor 1a (HIF-1a), a central transcription factor of the hypoxic response, induces genetic instability by inhibiting DNA repair gene expression via a novel HIF-1a-c-Myc pathway, suggesting the involvement of functional impairment of DNA repair in tumor development and progression. Despite the heavy implication in tumor growth and angiogenesis, HIF-2a, an isoform of HIF-1a, fails to inhibit DNA repair because of threonine phosphorylation. In this proposal, we study the role of HIF-1a and HIF-2a in tumor development and progression. Specific Aim 1 and Specific Aim 2 test the hypothesis that the induction of genetic instability through activation of HIF-1a-Myc pathway confers malignant traits such as invasion on cultured tumor cells in vitro and tumorigenicity, local invasion, and metastasis in tumor xenograft models. Specific Aim 3 investigates the requirement of phosphorylation for HIF-2a activities and in turn tumor growth in both cell culture and mouse models We believe that this proposal addresses the fundamental mechanisms underlying the dynamic nature of tumor growth and progression and will build a molecular basis for the development of novel therapeutics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Cancer is, in essence, a genetic disease acquiring dynamic changes in the genome. This proposal tackles the obscure mechanisms underlying genetic instability of cancer cells, an insurmountable problem in the fight against cancer. We anticipate this study will help define the molecular basis for the development of novel therapeutics.

Although the genomics revolution has resulted in high profile advances in cancer therapeutics, these have not translated into a definitive improvement in the survival of patients with advanced disease. Thus, it is critical to continue the study of the molecular pathogenesis of colon cancer with the goal of improved diagnosis and treatment. Over the past decade, we have studied the autocrine growth inhibitory factor, transforming growth factor beta(TGFbeta), in normal and aberrant intestinal epithelial growth. During this interval, TGFbet, its receptor, and the Smad signaling pathway have been decisively recognized as a critical axis of tumor suppression in the intestinal epithelium. In certain contexts however, TGFbeta signaling may contribute to tumor promotion, a duality of function that is increasingly recognized in neoplastic disorders. We propose to explore this dual activity of TGFbeta in in vivo and in vitro models of intestinal neoplasia, especially in the context of oncogenic Ras, which we have defined as a key repressor of growth inhibitory Smad-dependent TGFbeta signaling. The overarching hypothesis is that TGFbeta is a tumor suppressor via Smad-dependent signaling early in tumorigenesis. At later stages of disease TGFbeta signaling switches, in part under the influence of oncogenic Ras, to tumor promotion. The specific aims are to 1) test the hypothesis that histone deacetylases are Smad-binding partners and modulators of Smad-dependent signaling; 2) test the hypothesis, using microarray analysis, that TGFbeta induces a unique transcriptome in Ras-transformed cells and then use the results to further characterize TGFbeta as a tumor promoter; 3) test the hypothesis that TGFbeta will have both tumor suppressing and tumor promoting functions in animal models of TGFbeta signaling and colorectal cancer using genetically engineered mice in which TGFbeta signaling is enhanced. Dissection of the pathways involved in the tumor suppressive versus the tumor promoting effects of TGFbeta will lead to opportunities to selectively inhibit its undesirable effects without compromising its tumor suppressive functions.","290288",

We previously found that CoSMC differentiation is tightly linked to cytoskeletal rearrangements during epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of proepicardial cells. Loss of cell-cell contacts is followed by rhoA-GTPase activation, translocation of the cysteine-rich LIM domain-containing protein Crp2 from focal contacts to the nucleus, and serum response factor (SRF)-dependent transcription of SMC target genes. In a screen for factors that promote EMT in explanted PEO cells, we found that sonic hedgehog (Shh) activated patched-1
(ptc, a Shh receptor), induced EMT and stimulated CoSMC differentiation. We then examined ptc-lacZ knock-in mice and found that beta-gal staining was concentrated in cells at the medial-adventitial border in developing coronary vessels. Moreover, immunostaining localized Shh specifically to the interface between SMC and adventitial cells. In developing hearts, ptc-lacZ activity paralleled the appearance of PDGFbeta-receptor-positive CoSMCs in a proximal to distal sequence from E15.5 to P3. To luther define the roles of Shh signaling during CoSMC development and differentiation, we propose the following: Specific Aim 1 will map the expression of hh ligand, receptor and modifier genes during formation of the coronary vessels. We will explore a novel and unsuspected role for adventitial cells as Shh-responsive signal mediators that orchestrate development of this unique vascular bed. Specific Aim 2 will examine molecular pathways by which proepicardial cells differentiate to CoSMCs. We will focus on the role of potent SRF coactivators, including Crp2 and the myocardin family of proteins, as targets of Shh signaling, and as mediators of CoSMC differentiation. Specific Aim 3 will examine the functional roles of Shh signaling during development and repair of the coronary vasculature using mice that are genetically-deficient in hh signaling."," ",

have a disproportionately large impact on human health. These diseases include type I diabetes,
pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and affect both the endocrine and exocrine compartments of the gland.
The endocrine pancreas includes insulin-producing beta cells, resident in the islets of Langerhans, while the
exocrine pancreas comprises digestive enzyme-secreting acinar cells andthe ducts through which their
secretions are channeled to the gut. The research program of our lab reflects a conviction that a better
understanding of pancreas developmental biology will promote efforts to treat or cure these diseases. In
particular, we are interested in the intercellular signals that regulate pancreas development, as these may
offer attractive targets for therapeutic intervention in pancreatic disease. We have shown that beta-catenin,
an intracellular mediator of canonical Wnt signaling, is required in vivo for the initial formation of pancreatic
acinar cells, and that canonical Wnt signaling components are expressed and apparently active in the
embryonic and regenerating pancreas. The central hypothesis of the research proposed here is that
development of acinar cells requires active Wnt signaling through the canonical, beta-catenin-dependent
pathway. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this requirement applies not only to embryonic acinar
development, but also to regeneration of acinar cells following injury. We propose three Specific Aims, using
a combination of explant culture and mouse molecular genetics, to test these hypotheses. (1) We will
establish the function of canonical Wnt signaling per se, including components upstream and downstream of
beta-catenin, in the developing mouse pancreas. (2) We will determine the effects of beta-catenin deletion
on the cell fate of pancreatic progenitor and precursor cells at multiple stages of organogenesis. (3) We will
characterize the role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the maintenance and injury-induced regeneration of
adult acinar cells. Wnt signaling is critical to development and cancer in other organ systems, and our
studies will delineate its potential roles in pancreatic organogenesis and regeneration. Furthermore, our
research will generate critical insight into the mechanisms underlying adult pancreatic regeneration, a
controversial phenomenon relevant to both stem cell therapeutics and tumorigenesis.","300346",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
 Candidate's Plans/Training: The candidate plans a career as an independent investigator focusing on laboratory research related to interstitial lung disease. Training will include formal course work in cell biology and immunology and closely mentored completion of the research protocol. Environment: The Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons will provide formal course work. The Department of Medicine and the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine will provide research support. The sponsor, co-sponsor, collaborators, and steering committee will provide formal oversight and mentoring to see the candidate's training and project to completion. Research: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic illness leading to progressive scarring of the lung, with a median survival of 2.8 years from the onset of symptoms. There are no known effective therapies, except possibly lung transplantation. ""Fibroblastic foci,"" tufts of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts adjacent to injured alveolar epithelium, seen in pathologic specimens, likely represent the ""leading edge"" of disease. To identify novel mediators in IPF, mRNA was isolated from the fibroblastic foci and from patients without IPF. Gene expression profiling revealed highly significant up-regulation of methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2), an enzyme that has been implicated in cell cycle regulation, a process which is likely to be important in IPF. To study the role of MetAP2 in pulmonary fibrosis, fumagillin, a specific inhibitor of MetAP2, was tested in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Preliminary data show that fumagillin attenuated deposition of collagen in bleomycin-exposed mice. There is a nearly 44% reduction in the number of myofibroblasts in the lungs from mice that received fumagillin compared to controls suggesting that fumagillin decreases fibrosis by decreasing the number of collagen-producing cells. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of MetAP2 in pulmonary fibrosis. RELEVANCE - There is no known cause or cure for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The ultimate goal of this study is to uncover a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of IPF.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, the new concept of ""stem cell plasticity"", and the hope that stem cells could be used to repair damaged tissues has generated immense excitement. The field is now undergoing a more realistic and critical period of investigation, and cell fusion has been shown after specific types of damage in liver and muscle, both organs with a high number of multinucleate cells. The field is still an extremely exciting one, and many questions remain to be answered before Stem Cell Therapy for tissue repair can or should be used clinically. During our first period of funding, we developed the in vivo models necessary to now answer specific questions regarding tissue repair by stem cells. Our proposal will focus on using these models to address the three major questions in the field; 1. What cell type can best mediate repair in liver and muscle? 2. Is repair occurring through fusion, differentiation, or secretion of angiogenic factors by infused stem cells to initiate revascularization? 3. How are stem cells recruited to sites of injury and can we enhance this to induce more robust repair? HGF is a chemoattractant and viability factor elevated in injured liver, cardiac, and skeletal muscle, in addition to other organs. It is activated by cleavage from the inactive form at sites of hypoxic damage. HGF affects the motility and maintains the viability of myoblasts, hepatic oval cells, and hematopoietic stem cells. We hypothesize that HGF, activated in response to tissue injury and hypoxia, acts in a gradient-specific manner to recruit primitive, c-met+ stem cells into the site of muscle or liver injury. We hypothesize that HGF will maintain the viability of the recruited stem cells, while they are directed by inductive, tissue-specific factors in the local microenvironment to differentiate, fuse, or initiate revascularization, to participate in tissue regeneration. To test this hypothesis, in Specific Aim 1, we will define the optimal human cell population to inject into immune deficient mice to induce the most robust recruitment to damaged liver vs. cardiac muscle. Purified HSC and MSC populations will be compared to the ALDH hi/lin- population, which contains both HSC and endothelial progenitors, and to HSC/MSC co- transplantation. Cell tracking to the injured tissue will be accomplished by GUSB expression from normal human cells in NOD/SCID/MPSVII (GUSB null) mice, coupled with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In Specific Aim 2, we will explore the role of hypoxia, HGF/c-met, and CXCR4/SDF-1 in recruitment of human progenitors to injured liver and muscle. In specific aim 3, we will use clonal marking at the single cell level to rigorously determine whether individual stem cells isolated from human cord blood and bone marrow can give rise to liver or muscle tissue, in addition to blood. Our Overall Goal is to optimize recruitment of defined human progenitor populations to damaged liver and muscle in novel immune deficient mouse models of tissue injury, to obtain more robust repair.

nephrology. The principal investigator has completed residency and clinical nephrology training in Boston
and now will expand his scientific skills through a carefully formulated plan combining the unique resources
of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University.
 The plan will promote command of epithelial cell biology as it relates to renal injury and fibrosis. The
principal investigator's scientific development will be fostered by Dr. Joseph Bonventre, the Chief of the
Division of Nephrology. To enhance training, this proposal includes a collaboration with Dr. Andrew
McMahon, an expert in the cellular and molecular mechanisms which regulate growth and differentiation. In
addition, an advisory committee will provide scientific advice and career guidance. The committee includes
Dr. Dennis Brown, a renal epithelial cell biologist and expert microscopist, Dr. Raghu Kalluri, an extracellular
matrix biologist and Dr. Arlene Sharpe, an immunologist and Director of the mouse transgenic core facility.
 Research will focus on Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (Kim-1), a membrane protein identified by Dr.
Bonventre's lab that is strongly induced in proximal tubular renal epithelium after kidney injury.Kim-1
promotes a dedifferentiated cell phenotype in vitro, and we hypothesize that Kim-1aids in tubular
regeneration after injury by promoting cellular dedifferentiation and proliferation leading to regeneration of an
intact tubular epithelium. Aberrant or chronic expression of this protein, however, may drive epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT)and ultimately cause renal fibrosis. The specific aims of this proposal
include: 1) Characterize Kim-1 dependent EMT and signaling pathways using cell culture models, 2) Identify
proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of Kim-1using the yeast two-hybrid technique and 3)
Create a mouse model with targeted overexpression of Kim-1 in renal proximal tubules to determine whether
chronic overexpression of Kim-1 promotes renal fibrosis.
 The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease in our aging population represents an enormous
health burden. Because the final common pathway for chronic nephropathies is renal fibrosis, therapies that
reverse or slow fibrosis would have tremendous clinical impact. These studies could validate Kim-1 as a
therapeutic target in renal fibrosis and are therefore of great public health interest.","134276",

These include the epithelial cells of the distal alveoli and proximal airways, and the mesenchymal cells of the blood vessels, airway smooth muscle and cartilage rings. In addition, mechanisms normally exist that enable the adult lung to undergo remodeling and repair in response to inflammation and injury. Abnormalities in the proliferation, differentiation and morphogenesis of the different cell types of the lung can lead to serious pathological conditions, including chronic lung disease of premature babies, interstitial fibrosis, asthma and lung cancer. The goal of this proposal is to test specific predictions about the roles of the important Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) intercellular signaling pathway in the development and postnatal remodeling of the mouse lung. Previous gene expression studies, transgenic gain and loss-of-function experiments, and in vitro culture assays have provided evidence that genes encoding BMP ligands, antagonists, and receptors play critical roles in lung development and disease. However, many important questions remain unanswered. Among these are (1) the precise roles of BMP signaling through different receptors and ligands in the epithelium versus the mesenchyme, (2) the mechanisms by which BMP signaling in different cell types and at different stages regulates distinct processes of cell proliferation, lineage specification, differentiation and morphogenesis and (3) the role of BMP signaling in the poorly understood processes of postnatal lung repair and remodeling that appear to involve both changes in cell phenotype (transdifferentiation or metaplasia) and the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor/stem cells. We will address these questions using a variety of techniques, including conditional gene deletion based on Cre/lox technology, in vitro culture of normal and mutant lung cells and models of lung inflammation and injury. Taken together, these experiments will throw new light on the mechanisms by which extracellular signaling pathways interact to control the growth, development and postnatal repair of an organ system that is essential for human life. Moreover, the results will be relevant to other organs that develop by the process of branching morphogenesis.","365049",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Forkhead Box (Fox) transcription factors Foxml and Foxfl are expressed in developing pulmonary endothelial cells and play an essential role in lung development. Deficiency of either one of these Fox genes is associated with severe defects in formation of peripheral pulmonary capillaries as well as abnormalities in many organs causing embryonic lethality. Our hypothesis is that Foxml and Foxfl regulate transcription of genes critical for proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells during pulmonary vascular development. In order to test this hypothesis, we will use the Tie2 promoter driven Tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (Tie2-Cre-ERT2) transgene to mediate developmental-stage-specific deletion of either Foxfl or Foxml LoxP/LoxP (fl/fl) targeted allele in endothelial cells. In Aim 1, we describe plans to use Tie2-Cre-ERT2 Foxml fl/fl embryonic lungs and cultured pulmonary endothelial cells derived from these embryos to determine whether Foxml is required for endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation during lung vascular development. In Aim 2, we will develop a mouse containing a Foxfl fl/fl targeted allele and use the Tie2-Cre- ERT2 transgene to mediate temporal endothelial-specific deletion of the Foxfl fl/fl at different stages of lung development. We will use Tie2-Cre-ERT2 Foxfl fl/fl mice to determine whether Foxfl directly regulates endothelial cell differentiation and identify a time period during which Foxfl function is required to elicit proper vascular lung development and to regulate Foxfl target genes. We have shown that Foxfl regulates expression of genes involved in Notch-2 signaling and that the Notch-2 pathway is critical for normal development of lung microvasculature. In Aim 3, we propose to generate mice with the endothelial-specific Tie-2 promoter driven Notch-2 transgene. These Tie-2 Notch-2 mice will be bred with Foxfl  mice to determine whether increased Notch-2 receptor levels in embryonic Foxfl  lung will restore normalcy to the development of alveolar microvasculature and prevent perinatal pulmonary hemorrhage in Foxfl  newborn mice. Completion of the proposed studies will enable us to determine the role of Foxfl and Foxml proteins in endothelial cells during lung development. These Fox proteins may also provide novel targets in genetic screening, diagnosis and treatment of human pediatric lung diseases including perinatal pulmonary hemorrhage and respiratory distress syndrome of premature born babies.

This shortcoming has inspired the construction of human mammary gland tissue in immunocompromised mice that appears to function in a fashion that closely resembles that of the normal human mammary gland. With the availability of this model, the precise biological and morphogenetic actions of various genes that are thought to participate in human breast pathogenesis can be examined. The mechanisms that lead to the hyperplasias seen in the human breast epithelium are still poorly understood. Prolactin (Prl) of pituitary origin is normally involved in promoting the development of the mammary gland late in pregnancy. Research to be conducted examines how Prl is able
to elicit histopathological alterations in the mammary epithelium that represent early steps of tumor progression. A genetically altered mouse model that has been developed will prove highly useful in elucidating the biochemical changes in mammary epithelial cells (MECs) that are directly induced by the ligand-activated Prl receptor. A third line of research addresses the molecular mechanisms that enable tumorigenic but non-invasive MECs to acquire the traits that enable such cells to invade and metastasize.
Three transcription factors (TFs) have been characterized that are capable of activating the epithelial-tomesenchymal transformation (EMT) that appears to be closely linked to the acquired ability of MECs to invade and thereafter to metastasize. Detailed research will be focused here specifically on the Goosecoid TF. On the one hand, expression of this TF can be induced in epithelial cells by TGF, a protein that has frequently been associated with the invasive front of primary tumors. On the other, Goosecoid is capable of programming many of the changes associated with the EMT, including loss of epithelial markers, acquisition of mesenchymal markers, and increased motility. The functional relationships between Goosecoid and two
other TFs that function analogously will be explored in an attempt to determine whether a single signaling circuit involving these three TFs is responsible for programming all types of cancer-associated invasiveness, or whether different TFs are associated with distinct invasion-controlling regulatory circuits in human MECs."," ",

associated with severe skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular complications including death due to ruptured
aortic aneurysms. Our prior work has shown that many manifestations of MFS are caused byexcessive
activation of and signaling by TGFbeta, a family of growth factors that regulate cell performance and survival.
Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) is a newly recognized and apparently common disorder caused by mutations in
either of the two genes that encode the TGFbeta receptor (TBR). MFS and LDS are intimately related
conditions, both in terms of clinical manifestations and pathogenetic mechanisms. We believe that the
integrated study of both disorders will be particularly powerful. Our foundations derived from prior study of
mouse models of MFS will provide a meaningful context within which to interpret newly created animal
models of LDS. This will include a dedicated assessment of the lung, bone, skeletal muscle, aorta, and valve
leaflets in TBR-deficient animals, both with and without treatment with TGFbeta neutralizing antibody. In
contrast to MFS (where signaling defects are initiated by matrix perturbations), the cell-autonomous nature of
the defect in LDS will allow rapid and definitive evaluation of other potentially relevant pathogenetic events
(including altered angiotensin II (Angll), p38, ERK1/2 and JNK signaling) using cell culture systems and
pathway-specific pharmacologic antagonists; positive results will allow for hypothesis-driven interrogation of
tissues derived from Marfan mice and patients. We will evaluate for genetic interactions in TBR mutant
animals that are also deficient for fibrillin-1 or that conditionally overexpress Smad7, a natural inhibitor of
TGFbeta. These data will help to segregate features of MFS that manifest either structural or regulatory
(TGFbeta-related) deficiencies of fibrillin-1. Mouse studies will compare the efficacy of treatment with a beta-
adrenergic receptor blocker (that lowers hemodynamic stress) with that for losartan (that both lowers
hemodynamic stress and antagonizes TGFbeta) in the treatment of LDS, a devastating disorder associated
with vessel rupture and death in early childhood. Results will inform our linkage effort to identify genetic
modifiers of the MFS using exceptional pedigrees that show discrete variation in disease manifestations.
Taken together, these data will facilitate the development of novel and rational therapeutic strategies.","123000",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be proliferated indefinitely while retaining a normal karyotype, and can be used in vitro to study the earliest stages of differentiation. While in vitro studies (drug testing, target identification) may ultimately be medically more valuable than in vivo applications, it is the latter that has captured our imagination. The decision to fund research on hESCs opens up unprecedented opportunities. Public funding takes the research out of the private sector, where it has been motivated solely by economic necessities, into the public sector, where it can be performed without the driving force of the marketplace. The course proposed in this application, ""CHOC Human Embryonic Stem Cell Culture Training Course"", is a continuation of our current successful course which provides hands-on training for investigators to learn how to culture, manipulate, and differentiate hESCs in vitro. This course brings together some of the leading experts on hESC technology and through comparative approaches, effectively trains students in the successful culture, maintenance and manipulation of hESCs using lines WA01 and WA09 from the NIH hESC Registry. A major long term goal for this course has been to share and improve standard protocols. Specifically, this course aims are: 1) Demonstration of proper growth conditions for cells; 2) Proper freeze-thaw cycling and preparation of cell passages; 3) Use of co-culture techniques; 4) Use of cell separation procedures; 5) Review of basic good laboratory practices for use of human biological materials; 6) Development of protocols that support the characterization of embryonic stem cells; 7) Application of standard research protocols for directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells; 8) Employment of standard detection methods for infectious organisms or other contaminants; and 9) Cross-training of techniques used in other applications of stem cell biology. These aims are accomplished by offering intensive 10-day ""immersion"" courses to 12 participants chosen for their outstanding research potential and commitment to institute hESC research in their own laboratories. In addition, the future courses will each conclude with a day-long symposium, ""Cellular Therapies in Pediatric Diseases"", designed to highlight the clinical goals and obstacles for hESC research. This symposium, which focuses primarily on pediatric diseases, will be open to the general public as well as biomedical researchers and clinicians and, for the latter, will provide Continuing Medical Education credits. The courses are held annually in the Spring at the National Human Neural Stem Cell Resource of the Neuroscience Laboratories at the Children's Hospital of Orange County Research Institute.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Current interventions and treatments have not been able to significantly reduce the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic disease of abnormal saccular and alveolar lung development. Novel and innovative studies investigating the causes and molecular mechanisms leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia are therefore critical. Prenatal exposure to chorioamnionitis (inflammation of the maternal membranes, placenta, and uterus) increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. Experimental mouse models of chorioamnionitis will allow investigation of how inflammatory signals might alter fetal lung development. Bacterial endotoxin inhibits saccular airway branching in fetal mouse lungs. Endotoxin exposure decreases the expression of FGF-10, a critical growth factor for airway branching and lung development. This proposal tests the hypothesis that endotoxins release inflammatory mediators that inhibit FGF-10 expression in the fetal mouse lung, leading to abnormal saccular airway branching and contributing to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Aim 1 will rigorously test if decreased FGF-10 is responsible for the abnormal lung development observed with endotoxin exposure. Aim 2 will test if activation of the transcription factor NF-(B leads to inflammatory signals that inhibit FGF-10 expression. Chemical NF-(B inhibition and genetically engineered mouse strains with defective NF-(B signaling will test if this pathway is required for inhibiting FGF-10. Also, using endotoxin-conditioned media and preventing the release of intermediate factors will test if secondary inflammatory mediators can mediate the downstream effects of endotoxin on lung development. Aim 3 will then develop novel experimental models to test if NF-(B activation and inflammatory signaling in specific cell types in the developing lung are required for decreased FGF-10 expression and abnormal lung morphogenesis. This proposal therefore tests if inflammation-mediated loss of FGF-10 leads to abormal fetal lung development and potentially contributes to chronic lung disease in preterm infants. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This proposal investigates potential molecular mechanisms leading to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, an important disease aflicting preterm infants. Up to 10,000 new cases of bronchopulmonary dysplasia occur each year in the United States, making it one of the most common and costly diseases of childhood.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retinoic acid (RA) is a metabolic derivative of vitamin A (retinol) that functions as a signaling molecule. RA is essential for eye development, but its action is poorly understood. RA signaling occurs when retinol is metabolized to RA which serves as a ligand for nuclear RA receptors that regulate gene expression. The enzymes controlling synthesis of RA during embryogenesis are now under investigation and such studies are providing new information on the mechanism of RA action during eye development. Studies on mouse embryos have demonstrated the existence of three retinaldehyde dehydrogenases differentially expressed in the eye that synthesize RA, i.e. RALDH1, RALDH2, and RALDH3. Investigations of Raldh1, Raldh2, and Raldh3 null mutant mice have uncovered eye defects, and further studies of these mice are beginning to reveal the mechanism of RA action. As the three Raldh genes are conserved in mice and humans, the null mutants we have developed are excellent mouse models for understanding the mechanism of RA action during human eye development. Evidence exists suggesting that RA deficiency caused by dietary vitamin A deficiency may be linked to the human eye defect known as ocular coloboma. The genetic studies proposed will provide information relevant to treatment of human eye diseases whose etiology involves genetic deficiency in RA synthesis and/or dietary vitamin A deficiency: We have found that the location of RA synthesis undergoes dynamic spatiotemporal changes during eye development, and that the location of RA action changes in synchrony. Raldh2/Raldh3 double mutant mouse embryos develop an optic vesicle, but this structure lacks RA synthesis and fails to invaginate ventrally to form the optic cup. Raldh3 null mutant embryos develop an optic cup but they display defects in closure of the optic fissure (coloboma). Raldhl null mutant embryos lack RA synthesis in the dorsal retina, but eye defects are not observed. However, Raldh1/Raldh3 double mutants display excessive invasion of perioptic mesenchyme anterior to the retina, thus revealing a function for Raldhl that is normally compensated by Raldh3 (and vice-versa). These findings have led to the hypothesis that RA controls eye morphogenetic movements rather than dorsoventral patterning of the retina as previously thought. The overall goal of this project is to determine the mechanism of RA signaling during eye development, particularly the gene networks regulated by RA in the eye. We will test the hypothesis that RA regulates eye morphogenetic movements of both the retina and the surrounding perioptic mesenchyme. These studies will be performed genetically using Raldh compound null mutant mice that are unrescued or rescued by various genetic or pharmacological methods. Specific investigations will focus upon: (1) RA control of cell shape and cell adhesion during optic cup formation; (2) RA-FGF antagonism during optic cup formation; (3) RA control of perioptic mesenchyme invasion following optic cup formation.

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Asthma is a common disease, affecting ~7% of the adult US population, but not all asthma is the same. This
project is directly relevant to public health in that it will establish methods to identify the different types of
asthma and help target specific asthma therapies to the patients who will benefit from them the most. In
addition, these ""genome-wide"" studies, combined with cell culture studies, have the potential to identify
unsuspected causes of asthma that could be targets for new therapies directed at inflammation, airway
remodeling and steroid-resistance in asthma.","NHLBI","7620131","9/24/2008 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-08-006","1R01HL095372-01","1","R01","HL","095372","01"," ","GAN, WEINIU","9/24/2008 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-K(S1)"," ","2053807","WOODRUFF, PRESCOTT G","Not Applicable","12","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","US","37.78689","-122.448998","577508","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO","SAN FRANCISCO","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","941432510","UNITED STATES","N","9/24/2008 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2008"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","  
DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although asthma is typically thought of as a single disease, our recent data suggest that not all asthma is the same. These observations suggest that asthma treatment could be improved by targeting specific therapies to the specific groups of patients that will respond to them. Unfortunately, we do not currently have methods to distinguish these different groups of patients. The overall goal of this grant is to develop novel methods to identify these groups of patients with asthma. We propose to do this in three ways, by developing methods to: 1) distinguish patients with different types of underlying inflammation, 2) distinguish patients with chronic structural changes in the airway (remodeling) from those without such changes and 3) distinguish patients who will respond well to inhaled corticosteroids from those who will not. Some patients may have asthma due to allergic inflammation caused by over-activity of interleukin-13 [IL13], a biological mediator that clearly causes an asthma-like condition in mice. Indeed, specific blockers of IL13 are being developed as a therapy for asthma. However, our data show that only half of patients with asthma have over activity of IL13, and currently there is no way to distinguish which patients these are. Therefore, the first aim of this grant is to develop markers of ""IL13 driven"" asthma by studying the expression of genes in lung tissue and blood of patients using gene expression microarrays. The results will help target IL13 blocking therapy to those who will benefit. Some patients with asthma have chronic structural changes in the airway known as airway remodeling. This remodeling is thought to cause chronic airway narrowing. However, it is currently impossible to determine who has remodeling without a biopsy. In aim 2 of this grant, we propose to measure remodeling in biopsies using a technique called ""stereology"" and identify markers of remodeling based on gene expression in the lung and blood. We believe the results will establish better methods for studying airway remodeling in patients and will identify genes that cause remodeling. Finally, some patients with asthma respond very well to inhaled corticosteroid therapy, whereas others do not. The reasons for this are poorly understood and it is difficult to predict who will respond. Furthermore, patients who do not respond well to inhale corticosteroids can be difficult to manage. In aim 3 of this grant we propose to identify markers of response to inhaled corticosteroids in asthma by applying gene expression microarrays to lung and blood cells as part of 2 clinical trials of inhaled steroids. These results will help identify patients who are resistant to corticosteroids. They will also identify genes that contribute to steroid resistance. Indeed, in each of these aims, the markers that we identify may also be causes of the inflammation, remodeling, corticosteroid resistance from which some patients with asthma suffer. Therefore, in addition to studies performed in human subjects, we propose to use cell culture models to study whether these genes can cause these problems. The ultimate goal of these cell culture studies is to identify new therapies for asthma. (End of Abstract)

(FGFR) over-accumulates on the cell surface. This phenomenon is observed in the Drosophila mutant and in
the malignant renal cell carcinoma (RCC) culture. The likely cause is the mutation in the von Hippel-Lindau
tumor suppressor gene (VHL). It was also noted that the over-accumulated FGFR leads to aberrant cell
migration and induction of Etsl activity. Based on these and other preliminary data, a hypothesis is proposed
that will study the novel intracellular mechanism that underlies the FGFR accumulation phenotype and how
this aberrant signaling event, via Etsl, can modulate cell motility. We suspect that the pathway at least in part
confers elevated cell motility by affecting integrin activities. We will utilize in vitro and in vivo model
systems and employ cross-species comparative studies to dissect the signaling mechanisms. Aim 1 will
dissect the vesicle transport pathway that results in FGFR over-accumulation and the effects of dysregulated
signaling events. Aim 2 will analyze the role of Etsl in modulating the integrin activities, in relation to its
potential target genes Skap55 and integrin |34. Aim 3 will examine the in vivo functional relationship

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Form and function are intricately linked in the development of the heart. The endocardial cushions of the atrioventricular (AV) canal and outflow tract must form into proper valves and septa in order to establish unidirectional blood flow. This requires induction and control of endocardial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT), a process that is vital to chamber septation and valve formation. Miscues in EMT-related signaling can lead to abnormal valve development and congenital heart defects. In this regard, regulation of the molecular pathways mediating differentiation and morphogenesis of mammalian cardiac valves is not well defined. The long-term goal of our research is to define mechanisms that are involved in the development of cardiac cushions and their eventual formation into valves. In this proposal, we will examine the MAPKKK, MEKK4, as a master regulator of this process. MEKK4 is a downstream effector involved with the receptor-Ras-MAPK pathway which we and others have strongly implicated in heart development. EGFR mutant mice have been shown to develop hyperplastic valves and a mutation making Shp-2 constitutively active increases the severity of this phenotype. HB-EGF stimulation of EGFR plays a negative role in regulating this pathway because HB-EGF-deficient embryos develop a hyperplastic valve phenotype similar to the EGFR mutant mice. We have shown that MEKK4 is expressed in the endocardial cushions during heart development and providing a dominant negative kinase inactive MEKK4 to an ex vivo assay for EMT significantly reduces mesenchyme outgrowth. Furthermore, mice expressing kinase inactive MEKK4 exhibit undefined heart defects. Since MEKK4 interacts with Shp-2 and ERK, key components in the propagation of EGF-ErbB signals, we will investigate the ability of MEKK4 to control activation of the ERK pathway during EMT through effects on Shp-2 and regulation by HB-EGF and EGFR. This is the first time MEKK4 has been implicated to the ERK pathway and the first proposed role for MEKK4 during heart development. Through our studies, we expect to i) determine the contribution of MEKK4 kinase activity and ii) elucidate the regulatory contribution of MEKK4 to heart valve development. This information will provide a more comprehensive understanding of normal and abnormal heart development that will be important in designing new repair strategies for congenital heart defects.

Studies have shown that some types of cancer, like breast lung,       prostate and colon cancer respond to NSAIDs. Given in conjunction with radiation and       chemotherapy improve patient outcome. In cancer prevention studies NSAIDs and other       cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (COX-2) have shown 30-50% efficacy in preventing a variety of       cancer. Despite these positive effects, it has been shown that NSAIDs can cause gut ulceration       as well as increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. Despite the promise of COX- specific       inhibitors the risk of thrombosis remained. More recently, a new class of NSAIDs have emerged       which can release nitric oxide and other small redox active molecules (hydrogen sulfide) which       overcome both these side effects. In conjunction with Cancer Redox Biology Faculty and chemist       in the extramural progam and inducstry, we have been evaluating a variety of redox active       NSAIDs in various models of cancer treatment and prevention. We have focused on NSAIDs that       modified with anethole dithiolthione (ADT) a know cancer prevention agent that releases       hydrogen sulfide. We have discovered that these compounds have chemopreventive and       antiangiogenic properties. Furthermore the compound are effective in treating Non small cell       lung carcinoma (NSLC) and invasive breast cancer. These compounds can reverse many of the       molecular markers associated with metastasis. In addition, these we have assembled a number of       nitrogen oxide donors as well as those with antioxidant tempol (an superoxide dismutase       mimentic). The later has been shown to inhibit colon cancer.","218158",

Using a technique known as the serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), which allows for the quantification of individual transcripts within a cell, as well as identifies novel transcripts, we can examine the gene expression profiles of melanomas at different stages of disease using minute quantities of tissue. Currently, three of these libraries are available on the public databases (http://cgap.nci.nih.gov), which we generated from three different melanoma tissue samples, with two representing vertical growth phase tumors and one representing a distant tumor metastasis. Studies currently in progress include the generation of libraries from compound nevi, additional metastases and normal melanocytes. We can examine these data using microarray analysis tools rarely utilized to analyze SAGE libraries. These types of multilevel analyses can reveal which genes underlie progression and which genes may be viable targets for future therapy. 

Thus far, data generated by microarray and SAGE analyses have highlighted the importance of G-protein mediated signaling, resulting in the activation of PKC and rises in intracellular calcium in melanoma progression. These effects can be mediated by the gene WNT5A, the over expression of which can lead to increases in melanoma cell motility and invasion. RNAi inhibition of this pathway, followed by microarray analysis, reveals that Wnt5a may make this contribution to invasion by silencing the expression of metastasis suppressers such as Kiss-1 and NME-1.  Furthermore, we have also shown that Wnt5a can mediate melanoma metastasis via the initiation of the epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition, in a PKC-dependent fashion. In addition, Wnt5a can suppress the expression of melanoma antigens, such as MART1, implying it may play a role in escaping immune surveillance. Recent data suggests that this occurs via the activation of STAT3. In the light of recent data from other labs showing that targeting MART1 can cause tumor regression, these results are of significant importance and may provide a means to control MART antigen expression in tumors to facilitate immune responses against or the molecular targeting of such tumors. Because Wnt5A is a secreted ligand, making it a challenging target against which to develop a drug, we wish to identify which receptors might make viable targets for melanoma therapy, and this proposal focuses specifically upon a newly discovered orphan tyrosine kinase receptor, ROR2.  Our data indicate that ROR2 inhibition can lead to decreases in melanoma cell motility. Preliminary data from our laboratory indicates that ROR2 is present in high amounts in Wnt5A positive melanoma lines, and lower amounts in Wnt5A- negative lines. It is internalized in the former, but not the latter. Further, in low Wnt5A lines, where the receptor is present at the cell surface, treating these low Wnt5A lines with recombinant Wnt5A causes internalization of ROR2. Inhibiting ROR2 can decrease the effects of Wnt5A signaling and consequently melanoma cell motility in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, these data suggest that Wnt5A, via PKC, results in the phosphorylation of STAT-3 and a subsequent down-regulation of MART1, rendering these cells able to escape from immune surveillance. Modulation of Wnt5A or its receptors may provide beneficial effects for patients, either when coupled with immunotherapy, or as single agents.
 
Another gene implicated by the SAGE expression data is Claudin 1. We have found that claudin 1 is highly expressed in melanomas and that its expression is regulated via PKC. Furthermore, increased expression of claudin 1 results in an increase in melanoma cell invasiveness, with concomitant increase in the matrix metalloproteinase enzymes, MMP9 and MMP2. Staining of a tissue microarray indicates that this protein is upregulated in melanoma as compared to benign nevi. These data provide evidence of both an upstream regulator of PKC (Wnt5a) as well as a downstream target of this enzyme (claudin 1), both of which contribute to the increased invasiveness in melanoma. Analysis of phosphorylation sites in claudin-1 and the contribution of these sites to the motility of melanoma cells are currently underway. It is hoped that identifying important pathways such as these with high throughput gene expression profiling techniques will lead to identifying better molecular targets for the treatment of this disease.","402693",

To establish system for efficient differentiation of hESC into RBCs with potential to use for blood transfusions.

To generate erythroid cells from hESCs, as a first step, we cocultured hES cells with OP9 bone marrow stromal cell line for 6 days to induce their differentiation towards CD34+ cells, which included population of CD34+CD43+ hematopoietic progenitors (10-20%), CD34+CD43-KDR+ endothelial cells (up to 60%), and CD34+CD43-KDR- mesenchymal cells (less than 15%).  Subsequently CD34+ cells were isolated using magnetic sorting and cultured in non-adherent conditions in SFEM supplemented with SCF, TPO, EPO, IL-3, IL-6, EX-CYTE, insulin, dexamethasone, and transferrin for five days. From the day 6, cells were expanded in the same media without TPO, IL-3 and IL-6. After 10 days of culture, most of the cells were immature CD71+CD235a+ erythroid progenitors expressing high level of embryonic ¿- and fetal ¿-globin, and low level of adult ¿-globin as determined by PCR.  Erythroid progenitors continued proliferate in culture for up to 60 days resulting in more than 4000-fold expansion. Following expansion, ¿-globin expression increased and ¿-globin expression decreased and eventually disappeared by the day 50 of culture. Morphologic evaluation of expanded cells revealed homogenous population of erythroid progenitors at different stages of maturation, including erythroblasts and normoblasts.  By flow cytometry, essentially all cells were CD71+CD235a+ and CD34- and CD45-, confirming that they represent pure population of erythroid progenitors free of leukocytes. The described experimental system will be useful for the studies of genes regulating erythroid cell expansion, as well as molecular mechanisms regulating globin gene expression and switches during early hematopoietic development as well for large scale production of red blood cells from hESCs for clinical purposes. This research used WNPRC stem cell resources, start up funding and federally approved hES cell lines. No  publications yet.

and cardiovascular diseases. To reduce the prevalence of obesity, we need to understand the underlying
mechanism of adipogenesis such that effective preventive and treatment strategies could be
implemented to overcome these metabolic disorders. COUP-TFII is a member of the nuclear receptor
superfamily and is highly expressed in mesenchymal cells during development. Ablation of COUP-TFII in
mice results in early embryonic lethality due to defects in angiogenesis and heart development. During
the course of analyzing the phenotypes of COUP-TFII heterozygous mice, we noted that the mutant mice
are leaner and their adipose tissue mass is reduced in comparison to the control littermates. In addition,
the abdominal white adipose tissues appear more like brown adipose tissues by expressing UCP-1, a
marker of brown adipocytes important for adaptive thermogenesis. Consistent with the increase in brown
fat-like tissues, the COUP-TFII heterozygous mutant is more insulin sensitive and glucose tolerant. Using
3T3L1cell culture models, we demonstrated that COUP-TFII is highly induced during the expansion
phase of adipocyte differentiation. Knockdown of COUP-TFII expression during the early phase of 3T3L1
adipocyte differentiation disrupts the differentiation program and impairs the accumulation of triglycerides.
These findings suggest that COUP-TFII is likely an important but yet unexplored regulator of adipocyte
differentiation. To understand the role of COUP-TFII, we will use both tissue specific and conditional
knockout as well as in vitro cell culture differentiation system to dissect COUP-TFII's role in adipogenesis.
To accomplish these goals, three Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1: Determine the in vivo role of
COUP-TFII during adipogenesis; Aim 2: Investigate the mechanism by which COUP-TFII regulates
adipocyte differentiation; Aim 3: Analyze COUP-TFII target genes in adipocytes. Our studies are
timely and will reveal new information on COUP-TFII as a regulator of adipogenesis as well as provide
additional targets for obesity intervention."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purine nucleoside adenosine regulates such physiologic functions as heart rate, vasodilation and inflammation and receptors for adenosine have been targeted for such diverse conditions as Parkinson's Disease and, indirectly, Rheumatoid Arthritis. Few studies have addressed the role of adenosine and its receptors in bone metabolism despite clear demonstrations of bony pathology in children with marked elevations in adenosine levels due to adenosine deaminase deficiency. We had previously observed that adenosine A1 receptors regulate the stimulated formation of multinucleated giant cells by cultured human peripheral blood monocytes and therefore determined whether adenosine A1 receptors also regulated formation of osteoclasts, a related form of multinucleated giant cell. We were surprised to find, in preliminary studies, that either blockade or knockout of adenosine receptors prevents osteoclast formation in vitro. Moreover, adenosine A1 receptor knockout mice have increased bone formation in vivo and adenosine receptor blockade blocks bone loss in ovariectomized mice. Preliminary studies further demonstrate that blockade of adenosine A1 receptors in vitro alters signaling events required for osteoclastogenesis. We propose four aims to confirm and expand on our preliminary findings. In the first aim we will examine the role of adenosine and adenosine A1 receptors in osteoclast function and bone remodeling and confirm and expand on our preliminary studies. The second aim is to determine the biochemical basis for adenosine generation during bone remodeling using animals deficient in the enzymes that convert extracellular adenine nucleotides to adenosine (NPP-1, TNAP, CD39 and CD73). The third aim is to dissect the mechanism by which adenosine A1 receptors modulate the formation and function of osteoclasts in vitro using a combination of molecular techniques and inhibitors of signaling enzymes. The demonstration that adenosine A1 receptors play a critical role in regulating the formation and function of osteoclasts suggests a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of disorders characterized by osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One of the most pressing public health problems for the aging population is the increasing fragility and brittleness of bones, osteoporosis; brittle and de-mineralized bones are much more susceptible to fractures which are a major problem for the elderly. We have discovered that adenosine, a substance which is present in almost all bodily fluids, can bind to a receptor which is critical for formation and function of osteoclasts, the cells that break down bone. We propose to investigate the role of these adenosine receptors in regulating bone remodeling and the mechanism by which adenosine and its receptor modulate osteoclast function. The studies proposed here are directly relevant to human disease and may lead to the rapid development of new therapies for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and the resulting susceptibility to fractures that is so common in the elderly.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Contact inhibition is the ability of cells to inhibit motility and proliferation after forming cell-cell contacts. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanism underlying contact inhibition in normal epithelial cells. Epithelial cell-cell contacts are mainly formed by E-cadherin-based adherens junctions, which function as a focal point of many signaling pathways regulating various cellular behaviors, including most likely, contact inhibition. We recently reported that translocation of a protein complex to cell-cell contacts is pivotal to the establishment of contact inhibition. These complexes, defined here as ""Pak:PIX complexes"", minimally contain the Rac/cdc42 effector molecules p21-activated kinase 1 (Pak1) and the Rac/cdc42-guanine exchange factor betaPIX. In subconfluent cells, Pak:PIX complexes are in focal contacts, where they regulate cell motility and morphology. How they are recruited to cell-cell contact sites and how this translocation can regulate proliferation, is however unknown. The objective of this proposal is to characterize the mechanisms by which Pak:PIX complexes translocate from focal contacts to cell-cell contacts when cells become confluent, and to determine how this affects mitogenic signaling through the MEK-ERK pathway. The central hypothesis is that, upon E-cadherin-mediated activation of phosphatidyl inositol-3-kinase, Pak:PIX complexes are recruited to cell-cell contacts. This translocation may uncouple mitogenic signaling. In aim 1, we will characterize the translocation of Pak:PIX complexes and will identify new binding partners, in aim 2, we will further define the role of E-cadherin, and in aim 3, we will investigate how Pak:PIX complexes control contact inhibition by regulating the mitogenic MEK-ERK signaling pathway. The proposed research is important, as it will help to understand how localized, subcellular dynamic regulation of Rho effector proteins integrates the many signals that cells receive from their extracellular environment. The experiments outlined in this proposal will specifically address the mechanism that regulates the cell density-dependent localization of Pak:PIX complexes, which is crucial for contact inhibition. Identification of the mechanism underlying contact inhibition will allow us to identify specific target molecules that can be employed for diagnostic purposes or drug design. We anticipate that the results of our studies will yield novel and fundamental insights into the biology of epithelial morphogenesis.

FGFRs are single pass transmembrane receptors composed of an extracellular ligand binding region and a cytoplasmic region harboring the conserved tyrosine kinase domain. FGF-FGFR binding specificity is essential for the regulation of FGF signaling and is determined by primary sequence differences among FGFs and FGFRs. Similarly, specific recognition and tyrosine phosphorylation of intracellular targets by the activated FGFR is a fundamental step in FGF signaling and determines which specific downstream pathways are activated and, hence, what cellular response ensues. Aberrant FGF signaling is responsible for a wide spectrum of human pathological conditions including skeletal syndromes, olfactory syndromes, phosphate wasting disorders and cancer. The diversity of these diseases reflects the versatile and vital functions that FGFs play in human biology and provides a strong impetus for a thorough understanding of FGF signaling at the molecular level. The specific aims of this proposal are: 
I. Establish the pattern of, and determine the structural basis for, FGF-FGFR binding specificity/promiscuity. 
II. Elucidate the structural basis for autoinhibition in the extracellular region of FGFR. 
III. Elucidate the structural basis by which FGFR interacts with intracellular signaling molecules. IV. Elucidate the structural basis by which FGFR kinase domain mutations result in constitutive activation of FGFRs in human skeletal syndromes and cancer. 
The primary means to accomplish these aims will be X-ray crystallography, coupled with surface plasmon resonance and steady-state kinetic analysis. The fundamental structural and biochemical information obtained from these studies will enhance our knowledge of FGF signaling and will allow us to understand the effects of pathogenic FGF and FGFR mutations. In broader terms, these studies will facilitate the rational design of novel antagonists of FGF signaling for use in treatment of a variety of pathological conditions and will also enhance our understanding of signaling of the entire receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily.","603362",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of the proposed studies remains to understand the mechanisms of ischemic kidney cell injury and repair with a long range goal to establish therapies that will be useful to prevent and treat acute kidney injury (AKI) in man. Over the last support period we have further clarified the role of leukocyte- endothelial interactions, identified anti-inflammatory docosanoids which may hasten recovery, identified testosterone's contributions to the pathophysiology of AKI, and developed and validated a new biomarker of proximal tubule injury (KIM-1) in rodents and man. We have developed a new model of toxic injury in zebrafish, established and characterized mouse models of preconditioning and found that bone-marrow derived stem cells do not play a direct role in the reconstitution of the epithelium post ischemia. In the current proposal the first Specific Aim addresses the source of cells that depopulate the proximal epithelium during repair and the potential contribution of proximal tubule cells to the population of tissue phagocytes and fibroblasts that participate in normal and abnormal repair after ischemia. Genetic techniques will be used to label proximal tubule cells or their precursors either during development or later. We will evaluate whether stem/progenitor cells participate in repair or whether repopulation of the epithelium occurs as a result of dedifferentiation and proliferation of surviving epithelial cells? Using genetic labeling approaches in the second and third parts of this specific aim we will determine whether macrophage-like cells or fibroblasts derive from proximal tubule cells or proximal tubule epithelial progenitors after ischemia. In the second Specific Aim we will develop a new genetic model of targeted damage to the proximal tubule epithelial cell or macrophages using cell specific expression of the Diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR), and will use this approach to establish the determinants of the inflammatory and preconditioning responses and explore the role of macrophages in the pathophysiology of ischemia/ reperfusion injury and repair. Relevance (Lay summary): Kidney disease affects a large segment of the population. It is important to understand the relative roles of stem/progenitor cells and mature cells in the normal and abnormal repair of the kidney after it is injured. In addition the use of novel genetic approaches to target injury to the kidney will help in the determination of the factors important for ""good"" vs ""bad"" repair short term and long term.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transforming growth factor (TGF)-¿ is a critical regulator of events leading to chronic progressive renal disease such as extracellular matrix production, apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While considerable progress has been made in understanding signaling from the TGF-¿ receptor (T¿R) through the Smad signaling molecules, the role of adaptor proteins such as Smad Anchor for Receptor Activation (SARA) in these signals is not well understood. Our preliminary data indicate that, in human mesangial cells (MC) and renal tubular epithelial cell lines (HKC and HK-2), SARA binds to Smad2 in a TGF-¿-dependent manner. In contrast, SARA is constitutively bound to T¿R and is associated with early endosomes. After TGF-¿1 treatment, Smad2 is phosphorylated and clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) facilitates propagation of the TGF-¿ signal to the nucleus. Thus, SARA may play a central role in protein trafficking related to TGF-¿ signaling, particularly through its actions in T¿R trafficking and promoting Smad2 activity. In addition to SARA, our preliminary data have detected other adaptor proteins in MC and HKC that are proposed to function in Smad signaling but are even less well understood than SARA. Prolonged TGF-¿1 treatment leads to an eventual decline in SARA expression, which corresponds temporally to the assumption of a myofibroblastoid phenotype in MC, HKC and HK-2. We propose the hypothesis that by acting as scaffolding proteins to assemble and localize the T¿R signaling complex, the adaptor proteins SARA, Dab2 and Axin may each impact the TGF-¿ response, and the loss of SARA expression may alter the balance in T¿R interactions to modulate Smad signaling and enhance TGF-¿-stimulated fibrosis. To address this hypothesis we will pursue four specific aims: (1) Characterize the interactions of SARA, Dab2 and Axin with T¿R in TGF-¿ signaling, their role in T¿R-complex trafficking, and their effect on Smad2- vs. Smad3-mediated responses to TGF-¿1. (2) Examine whether the loss of SARA is sufficient to induce alterations in signaling or trafficking related to fibrosis, and determine how these changes occur. (3) Define the mechanism by which TGF-¿1 decreases SARA expression and the role of PI- 3-kinase in this down-regulation. (4) Determine whether a decrease in SARA expression could play a role in established in vitro and in vivo models of renal fibrogenesis. These studies will identify novel events related to TGF-¿ signaling and renal cell fibrogenic activity. SIGNIFICANCE: Although TGF-¿ is an important mediator of renal fibrogenesis, its mechanisms of action are poorly understood. Our data suggest that the balance among several T¿R-interacting adaptor molecules plays an important role in regulating TGF-¿ responses. Specifically, these studies may identify novel mechanisms whereby kidney cells transition to a fibrogenic phenotype. Understanding these mechanisms may indicate potential targets for interrupting renal scarring. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Transforming growth factor (TGF)-¿ is a protein that is found throughout the body and plays a central role in scarring of the kidney and other organs. Although we have made much progress in understanding how TGF-¿ works, we have not learned how to regulate its actions in order to prevent or minimize scarring of the kidney. This project seeks to understand how one group of proteins in the cell, the TGF-¿ receptor adaptor proteins, helps determine whether our cells are disposed to produce scar. In particular, we are interested in understanding how the expression of one protein, called SARA, is regulated and what role this regulation plays in scarring. Carrying out our specific aims will thus provide new basic information regarding how TGF-¿ works and how the kidney is damaged in progressive kidney disease that could be useful in prevention and treatment.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In human patients, lethality from cancer is almost invariably due to the consequences of metastasis. Therefore, understanding the molecular pathways that underlie the emergence and growth of metastasis is of great biological and clinical significance. Our proposed studies of prostate carcinogenesis will investigate the stages of progression to metastatic disease, and will be facilitated by the design and analysis of ""next-generation"" mouse models of advanced stages of prostate cancer that permit the identification, imaging, and molecular analysis of metastases. In our work, we will address fundamental questions concerning the origin and spread of metastatic disease, including: Do metastatic cells arise early or late in cancer progression? What is the basis for the tissue-selectivity of metastasis? What are the consequences of androgen ablation or surgical prostatectomy for metastasis? Are there metastasis-associated genes that specifically promote or suppress metastatic disease? What is the role of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in metastasis? Our specific aims are: (1) Detection of metastatic cells in a mouse model of prostate cancer by lineage-marking of prostatic epithelium to examine the time course and tissue distribution of disseminated metastatic cells. (2) Whole-animal non-invasive imaging of metastatic disease through longitudinal studies of prostate cancer growth and metastasis using in vivo imaging techniques. (3) Molecular analysis of metastatic cells and identification of metastasis associated genes by gene expression profiling of isolated metastatic cells for the identification and functional investigation of genes up- and down-regulated in metastatic cancer. (4) Functional analysis of metastasis-associated genes in the prostate epithelium by inducible gene targeting approaches to determine whether candidate genes play a key role in progression to metastasis, with a focus on regulators of the epithelial-mesenchyrnal transition. Our studies should identify the rate-limiting steps in the metastatic cascade, visualize the spread of metastasis in vivo, and provide an entry-point to studying the molecular basis for its tissue-selectivity, all of which should have important implications for prostate cancer treatment.

Anti-inflammatory approaches to treating IPF are unsuccessful in most instances leading to a shift in the paradigm of pathogenesis from that of chronic inflammation to a dissociation between the inflammatory response and unrelenting tissue fibrosis.  The pathogenic mechanisms in IPF are unknown and one hypothesis to explain the episodic nature of deterioration in patients with IPF is that an abnormal host response to injury exists in a susceptible host resulting in an exaggerated fibrotic response to a routine lung injury.  One of the limitations in elucidating pathogenic mechanisms in progressive fibrosis is the lack of model systems to investigate unremitting fibrosis.  We have identified a genetic deficiency in mice that leads to progressive fibrosis in the absence of increased lung inflammation following acute non-infectious lung injury.  Mice deficient in CXCR3, the receptor for the interferon-gamma inducible CXC chemokines CXC9, 10 and 11 (Mig, IP-10 and ITAC) develop severe and progressive fibrosis after lung injury.  This observation has led us to the hypothesis that an important component of progressive pulmonary fibrosis is a failure of endogenous host defense mechanisms to limit the extent of tissue remodeling.  Our preliminary data suggest that interferon-gamma is produced as an early response to lung injury and requires the presence of CXCR3.  We have identified CXCR3 as an important regulator of both the innate response to lung injury and the subsequent fibroproliferative response.  The goals of this proposal are to elucidate the mechanisms leading to unremitting fibrosis in CXCR3 deficiency and identify the mechanisms of the protective effect of interferon-gamma on the fibroproliferative response to lung injury.  Identifying mechanisms of progressive fibrosis and failures in host defense could lead to new therapeutic options in patients with IPF.","369790",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
This proposal describes a 5-year training program for development of an academic career in pediatric cardiology.  The candidate has completed a residency in pediatrics, a fellowship in pediatric cardiology, and is currently completing a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Postdoctoral Fellowship for Physicians.  The Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award is uniquely suited to promote the career development of the candidate as she transitions from postdoctoral fellow to junior faculty at a university medical center, and will allow the candidate to build on her strong biochemical background to acquire intellectual grounding and technical expertise in mouse genetics and developmental biology.  This training will aid the candidate in merging her clinical and research interests to become an independent investigator in the field of cardiovascular developmental biology.  
  
The research plan is designed to define the role of the heterotrimeric G protein G-alpha13 (Ga13) in vascular development.  Ga13 mediates signaling from a variety of G-protein-coupled receptors and is required for blood vessel development and survival of mouse embryos.  To test the hypothesis that Ga13 signaling in endothelial cells is important for normal blood vessel development and vascular integrity, and to probe the role of Ga13 signaling pathways in endothelial cell function and vascular and embryonic development, the candidate will:  1) use an endothelial-specific Ga13 transgene to attempt to rescue the vascular defects of Ga13-/-embryos, 2) use Cre-lox technology to create and analyze mice with endothelial-specific deletion of Ga13, and 3) analyze Ga13 deficient endothelial cells isolated from endothelial knockout mice in a variety of in vitro assays to determine the contribution of Ga13 signaling to cellular behaviors crucial for normal vascular development, such as chemotaxis and tube formation.  
  
The environment at UCSF's Cardiovascular Research Institute will expose the candidate to cutting-edge research in cell signaling and cardiovascular development.  The sponsor, Dr. Shaun Coughlin, is a physician-scientist with an exceptional record of developing young careers and initiating basic research programs with important clinical applications.  The advisory committee of Drs. Henry Bourne, Didier Stainier, and Zena Werb are leaders in the field of G protein signaling, cardiovascular development, and vascular biology, and are uniquely qualified to advise the candidate as well.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Vascular anomalies and remodeling occur in many congenital and acquired diseases such as cardiovascular malformations, diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary diseases of arteries and veins, peripheral vascular disease and myocardial ischemia and infarction. Defects in vascular development have been identified as a major cause of fetal demise. However, there is a paucity of knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie normal vascular development and particularly regarding the progenitors of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells and factors that determine their commitment to blood vessel phenotypes. Additionally, the genetic mechanisms by which these precursors subsequently develop further diversity are not well understood. These mechanisms are likely important for the maintenance of healthy vascular systems and for repair of damage in mature organisms. In mammals coronary vascular development is dependent on transient early embryonic structures within the proepicardium. Cells within the proepicardium migrate over the surface of the heart forming the epicardium and subsequently subepicardial mesenchymal cells (SEMC). SEMC are important for multiple aspects of heart development and give rise to the entire coronary vasculature consisting of fibroblasts, endothelial, and smooth muscle cells. Recent studies in our labs have determined that two transcription factors, Serum Response Factor (SRF) and GATA4, play seminal roles in controlling development of the proepicardium. The focus of this application is to determine the role of one of these factors, SRF, in regulating programs of gene expression required for commitment of proepicardial coronary vascular progenitor cells to vascular development. We will take advantage of transgenic SRF conditional gene knockout animals, recently developed by us, to address the hypothesis that initially SRF is required for formation of the proepicardium. The results of these studies will not only elucidate the underlying transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling early coronary vascular development, but should also identify coronary vascular precursor stem cells that may have the potential to lead to therapeutic applications in cardiac regeneration.

Background: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play pivotal roles in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis during development of many organs including skin. BMP signaling is activated by binding of the BMPs to BMP receptor complex that consists of type I and II BMP-receptors (BMPR-IA/IB, BMPR-II). In extracellular space, BMP signaling is modulated by BMP-antagonist noggin, which binds BMP-2/4/7 with high affinity and prevents their interaction with cell surface BMP receptors. BMP-Smad pathway is a major signaling mechanism that mediates BMP effects during development and postnatal growth. BMP-Smad pathway includes BMPRI-dependent phosphorylation of Smadl or Smad5 transcription factors, each of them then form the complex with Smad4 transcriptional co-activator followed by translocation into the nucleus to regulate transcription of BMP target genes.  
  
BMPs, noggin, Smad1 and Smad5 are broadly expressed in the hair follicle epithelium and mesenchyme during its development and cycling. However, due to embryonic lethality of the noggin, Smad1 or Smad5 knockout mice, their roles in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in the hair follicle remain largely unknown.  
  
Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that spatial and temporal specificity of BMP effects in distinct hair follicle compartments is determined by noggin-dependent magnitude of signaling through BMP receptors and by differential recruitment of the Smad1 and Smad5 transcriptional regulators.  
  
Purpose: 1) Define the effects of general inhibition of BMP signaling in hair follicle epithelium and/or mesenchyme on hair follicle morphogenesis, cycling and hair pigmentation using noggin transgenic mice as models.  
  
2) Delineate the roles of Smad1 and Smad5 transcriptional regulators in mediating the effects of BMP signaling on hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling using genetically engineered mice with loss of the Smad1 or Smad5 activity.  
  
3) Identify the downstream targets of Smad1 and Smad5 that mediate cross-talk between the BMP-Smad pathway and other receptor signaling systems involved in regulating hair follicle morphogenesis, cycling and hair pigmentation.  
  
Significance: This study will provide further insights into the mechanisms of hair-growth regulation by BMPs, noggin. and Smad1/5 and will lead to the identification of new important target molecules that mediate the effects of BMP signaling on hair-follicle cells. Successful realization of this project will help in further understanding the pathobiology of different hair-loss conditions and may provide new strategies for their therapy using BMP agonists or antagonists.","341408",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most important cause of impaired vision in the elderly. The major cause of severe vision loss in AMD is choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or the growth of new vessels under the retina. The pathogenesis of neovascular AMD is multifactorial, but in general, is considered to be driven by angiogenesis, a process in which the cellular components of the new vessel complex are derived from cells from the adjacent pre-existing capillary. However, an alternative mechanism termed ""postnatal vasculogenesis"", has been shown to contribute to some forms of neovascularization. In vasculogenesis, the cellular components of the new vessel complex are derived, in part, from bone-marrow derived circulating cells. Our group has previously demonstrated that CNV, in animal models, is formed in part from these bone-marrow derived cells. In this proposal, we will confirm and extend these findings to understand the contribution of the various cellular subsets within the circulation which may affect pathogenesis, progression and severity of CNV. Initial work will be done in two rodent models of CNV, the laser-induced and subretinal injection of an adenoviral vector expressing vascular endothelial growth factor. Isolation and depletion experiments will attempt to identify the specific cell types found within the rodent bone marrow which contribute to the CNV. Our group has also demonstrated that these bone-marrow vasculogenic cells can also be identified in the peripheral blood of patients with various degrees of AMD. In subsequent experiments, we will confirm and extend our preliminary human findings and, similar to the preclinical work performed in animals, attempt to identify specific subsets of circulating cells which correlate with disease status. These results will be extended to include confirmatory experiments on patients undergoing surgical excision of CNV and the subsequent histologic analysis of the lesions. In addition, a case-controlled human clinical trial will be performed to further correlate the presence, absence or relative ratios of certain peripheral cells and the ability to predict development, progression or severity of CNV in patients with AMD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most important cause of impaired vision in the elderly. The major cause of severe vision loss in AMD is choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or the growth of new vessels under the retina. In this proposal, we seek to understand the contribution of the various cellular subsets within the circulation which may affect pathogenesis, progression and severity of CNV.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A variety of environmental insults induce the normally quiescent urothelium to mount a transient proliferative response and restore homeostasis. However, some insults, especially those with both potent mitogenic and mutagenic activities, lead to persistent urothelial proliferation that can progress to cancer, including urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma, the most common cause of bladder cancer death in the United States. A better understanding of the events that promote bladder repair and influence the decision between a return to quiescence vs. prolonged growth and cancer formation could lead to improved therapies aimed at promoting normal growth or repair or controlling cancer. Based on extensive preliminary evidence, this application investigates the hypothesis that signaling by the Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted morphogens promotes urothelial proliferation in response to chemical insults and becomes constitutively active in urothelial cancers. Mechanistically, we propose that Hh signaling in bladder injury repair is induced by expression of the 7 transmembrane span protein Smoothened (Smo), and activates several aspects of the malignant phenotype, including enhance proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cell motility. Since repair of tissue injury appears to be the proliferative stimulus resulting from exposure to chemical carcinogens, our findings suggest that urothelial carcinoma may originate as part of an epithelial repair program. To test this hypothesis, we propose a series of experiments to characterize the expression and roles of Hh pathway activity in urothelial homeostasis and carcinogenesis. The Aims to be pursued are: 1) To characterize the induction of Hh signaling, EMT, and stem cell activation in regenerating urothelium. 2) To test the effects of Hh pathway blockade on urothelial injury repair; 3) To test whether Hh signaling is necessary for urothelial carcinoma growth. 4) To test whether continuously enforced Hh signaling is sufficient to induce urothelial carcinogenesis.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lysyl oxidase is synthesized as a 50 kDa pro-enzyme, secreted into the extracellular environment where it is then processed by proteolytic cleavage to the functional 30 kDa enzyme and the 18 kDa propeptide. Expression of lysyl oxidase gene was found to inhibit the transforming activity of ras and was hence named as ""ras recision gene"" (rrg). Over expression of k-ras and other members of ras family is found in oral cancer. Our preliminary data indicates that lysyl oxidase expression is low in several oral cancer cell lines. We recently reported that the 18 kDa pro-peptide domain, and not the 30 kDa active enzyme, inhibits the ras transformed phenotype of fibroblasts. We also reported that the lysyl oxidase pro-peptide inhibits epithelial to mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells by affecting the ras dependent MEK/Erk and PI3K/Akt pathways. However, the mechanism by which the lysyl oxidase propeptide inhibits the ras signaling is not yet known. We have previously reported that lysyl oxidase interferes with a fibroblast growth factor loop in transformed fibroblasts. Our preliminary studies suggest that the lysyl oxidase pro-peptide inhibits ras activation and FGF-2 induced Erk phosphorylation in pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Here we propose that the lysyl oxidase propeptide interferes with the FGF-2 signaling upstream of MEK/Erk, thereby affecting the ras signaling. Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will identify the molecular targets of the lysyl oxidase propeptide. Effects of the lysyl oxidase pro-peptide on the FGF-2 signaling intermediates in two selected oral cancer cell lines will be evaluated. In particular, the effects on the phosphorylation of FGF receptors and other adaptor molecules will be determined. Furthermore, the effect on the formation of FGF receptor complexes will be determined. Indirect inhibition of ras signaling via SRC kinase and Sprouty 2 also will be evaluated. Aim 2 will determine the structure function relationship of the lysyl oxidase pro-peptide. We hypothesize that the highly conserved regions within the lysyl oxidase propeptide sequence have a functional significance in inhibiting the transformed phenotype. We will use custom synthesized small peptides, which include those regions to treat oral cancer cells in order to evaluate the effect on ras dependent MEK/Erk pathway. Overall these studies will further our understanding of the signaling mechanisms involved in the inhibition of ras dependent pathways. Furthermore, the identification of functionally significant regions of the lysyl oxidase pro-peptide may help define novel therapeutic drugs for the treatment of ras dependent oral cancer.  
  
Project Narrative The lysyl oxidase pro-peptide inhibits the ras-dependent phenotype of cancer cells. Since most oral cancers are ras-dependent, we propose to investigate the mechanism by which the lysyl oxidase pro-peptide inhibits the ras signaling in oral cancer and to determine the shortest functional sequence of the lysyl oxidase pro-peptide. These studies will be of great importance to develop new therapeutic agents for oral cancer.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  For the last 20 years matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been identified as important contributors to tumor progression on the basis of their abundant presence in neoplastic tissues, their ability to degrade all components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and preclinical studies demonstrating the potent anti-tumor activity of MMP inhibitors (MPIs). In our laboratory and over the last 15 years of funding from this grant we have moved from an initial focus on MMP inhibition as a mechanism to prevent tumor invasion and metastasis to a focus on earlier stages of tumorigenesis. Our recent data in the MMTV-Wnt-1 de novo mouse mammary tumor model suggest that MMPs play a critical role in epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and in tumor growth and angiogenesis. We hypothesize that there is a specific temporal expression of MMPs during Wnt-1 induced mammary tumorigenesis, with an initial dependence on neoplastic-derived MMP-3 for EMT and later dependence on MMP-9 for angiogenesis and tumor growth and that by targeting these two proteases, MPIs can inhibit tumorigenesis. This hypothesis is based on the observation that upon transformation with Wnt-1 mammary epithelial cells overexpress MMP-3, whereas Wnt-1 induced mammary tumors express MMP-9. In support of the hypothesis, we also observed that overexpression of a human tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP- 2) transgene in the mammary gland of MMTV-Wnt-1 mice prevents or significantly delays the formation of tumors and results in slower growing tumors that are rich in collagen and contain less vessels. We propose 3 specific aims. The first aim will examine the function of MMP-3 in Wnt-1 mediated EMT, exploring whether MMP-3 is a downstream event in the Wnt-1 signaling pathway that is necessary or sufficient for transformation and determining the role of MMP-3 and the ECM in migration and invasion of Wnt-1 transformed mammary epithelial cells. The second aim will focus on examining the mechanisms of tumor inhibition by TIMP-2 and MPIs in MMTV-Wnt-1 mice, with particular emphasis on identifying the role of MMP- 3, MMP-9 and fibrillar collagen in tumor growth and angiogenesis, and on documenting proteolytic activity by imaging techniques. The third aim will determine whether MMPs are involved in tumor development in other de novo mammary tumor models that more closely mimic human breast cancer and in testing the role of MPIs in these models as chemoprevention. These studies will bring our understanding of MMP and MMP inhibition in cancer to a next level, and will generate information that could be critical in the design of better therapeutic or chemoprevention trials with MPIs.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our goal is to understand the mechanisms by which information encoded in an extracellular signal is converted into complex patterns in the developing mammalian embryo. This proposal focuses on the role of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling. The Shh signaling pathway is not only essential for the induction of clinically relevant neurons within the CNS, but inappropriate activation of Shh signaling has been linked to the development of several types of tumor, most notably basal cell carcinoma (BCC) (the most common form of skin cancer), medulloblastoma (the most common brain tumor of children) and rhabdomyosarcoma (the most prevalent soft tissue cancer in children). Further, loss of Hedgehog (HH) signaling underlies several birth defects that include holoprosencephaly. Consequently, understanding how a Shh signal is received, transduced and modulated is likely to lead to new biological insights with direct relevance to human health. Given the close human parallel and advantages of available genetic approaches, the mouse is our principle experimental system. Aim 1 proposes to explore the biological significance of cholesterol modification of Shh investigating the role of a Dispatched gene in Shh release and the requirement for cholesterol in Shh-mediated patterning of the neural tube. A GFP tagged Shh protein will be generated to study Shh movement in vivo. Aim 2 proposes to explore the genetic interactions amongst several Shh-binding proteins (Ptch1, Ptch2, Gas1 and Hip1) that appear to act in Shh-mediated feedback control as they relate to neural patterning. We will map the interaction domains between Shh and one of these, Hip1. Aim 3 will explore the roles of several novel targets of HH-signaling identified in transcriptional screens.

with carcinogens in the process of mammary tumorigenesis. In the prior granting period, we demonstrated
that the serine-threonine kinases CK2 and GSK3(3 have opposing effects on Wnt signaling, and that CK2
and a kinase inactive (Kl) form of GSK3(3 can promote mammary tumorigenesis in vivo that is associated
with activated Wnt signaling. With our P01 collaborators, we established a model of carcinogen-induced
mammary tumorigenesis in FVB mice, and found upregulation of Wnt signaling, CK2, the aryl hydrocarbon
receptor, and NF-KB in the tumors. Thus, activation of CK2 and inhibition of GSK33 are demonstrated to
have the potential to contribute to mammary tumorigenesis and to the regulation of multiple signaling
pathways. The central hypothesis of this renewal is that CK2 and Wnt signaling are constitutivelv activated
by genetic and epiqenetic events in breast cancer and are regulators of epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT). leading to tumor invasion and to metastasis. This hypothesis will be tested through three specific
aims: Aim 1. We will study the interaction of a prototypical polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, DMBA with CK2
and Wnt signaling in vivo, using MMTV-CK2a transgenic mice and LEF-EGFP Wnt reporter transgenic mice.
Aim 2. One of the features of tumor progression is the loss of normal epithelial morphology and alteration in
cell adhesion molecules, through the process of EMT. In this aim we will explore the mechanism by which
CK2 and NF-KB collaborate to promote the EMT phenotype, and determine whether antagonizing CK2 can
reverse the invasive and/or metastastatic phenotype of tumor cells. Aim 3. Here we will investigate the
mechanism of upregulation of CK2 after exposure to carcinogens. The kinetics, level of regulation, and
requirement for AhR, NF-KB, and Wnt signaling in the process of upregulation of CK2 will be assessed.
Signficance: Identifying collaborating events in the process of tumor progression to the EMT-like phenotype
is of tremendous translational potential for preventing or curing invasive and/or metastatic cancer. If a kinase
is an important contributor in model systems, with evidence that this may also be the case in human breast
cancer, it provides a potential target for therapeutic intervention."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) undergo a unique process known as ""phenotype modulation"": the transition from a quiescent, ""contractile"" phenotype to a proliferative, ""synthetic"" state. This process contributes to numerous lung and vascular disorders, including lymphangioleiomyomatosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms controlling VSMC proliferation and differentiation as a prerequisite to the development of effective therapeutic protocols. The specific hypothesis is that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling shifts dedifferentiated VSMCs to a contractile phenotype, thereby contributing to the function and homeostasis of the vessel wall. We base this hypothesis on the results of in vitro studies, gene inactivation phenotypes and mutations found in human diseases, all linking BMP signaling to VSMC phenotype modulation, especially in the pulmonary vasculature. Our preliminary studies support this hypothesis and show that BMPs are potent inducers of VSMC differentiation in three different cell systems. Based on this evidence, the experimental focus of this 2-year R21 proposal is on the requirement of BMP signaling for maintenance of VSMC differentiation and its molecular mechanism of action. Specific Aim 1: Inhibit BMP signaling in cultured VSMCs via genetic inhibitors of the BMP receptors. We will correlate the expression of contractile markers with the loss of BMP influence. Specific Aim 2: Elucidate the pathways involved in BMP- mediated VSMC phenotype modulation. The p38 MAPK, RhoA and PI3K-Akt pathways can be activated by BMPs and are involved in VSMC differentiation. Using small molecule and genetic inhibitors, we will interfere with these Smad-independent pathways and with the canonical BMP-Smad 1/5/8 signal, and determine their contribution to the BMP-induced VSMC phenotype. Specific Aim 3: Characterize the mechanism of BMP-mediated regulation of VSMC-specific genes transcription. Known effectors of VSMC-specific transcription include the SRF/Myocardin/CArG-box complex and the TGF-( control element. We will examine the effects of BMP signaling on these two regulatory elements using VSMC-specific promoter-reporter constructs and small molecule or genetic inhibitors of SRF, myocardin and TGF(-specific signaling.

Alterations in this communication can lead to the       progression or expansion of malignant growth. The human mammary gland contains two distinctive       types of fibroblasts within the stroma. The epithelial cells are surrounded by loosely       connected intralobular fibroblasts, which are subsequently surrounded by the more compacted       interlobular fibroblasts. The different proximity of these fibroblasts to the epithelial cells       suggests distinctive functions for these two subtypes. We compared the gene expression       profiles between the two stromal subtypes. Fresh normal breast tissue was collected from       reduction mammoplasty patients and immediately placed into embedding medium and frozen on dry       ice. Tissue sections were subjected to laser capture microscopy to isolate the interlobular       from the intralobular fibroblasts. RNA was prepared and subjected to microarray analysis using       the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 GeneChip. Data was analyzed using the Affy and Limma packages       available from Bioconductor. Findings from the microarray analysis were validated by RT-PCR       and immunohistochemistry. No statistically significant difference was detected between the       gene expression profiles of the interlobular and intralobular fibroblasts by microarray       analysis and RT-PCR. However, for some of the genes tested, the protein expression patterns       between the two subtypes of fibroblasts were significantly different. This study is the first       to report the gene expression profiles of the two distinct fibroblast populations within the       human mammary gland. While there was no significant difference in the gene expression profiles       between the groups, there was an obvious difference in the expression pattern of several       proteins tested. These data also highlight the importance of studying gene regulation at both       the transcriptional and post-translational level. We are continuing to advance the       recapitulation of human breast epithelial morphogenesis by humanizing the mammary fat pad of       NOD/ SCID mice as described by Kuperwasser et al. 2004. The stromal cells fill over 50% of the       mouse mammary glands but normal epithelial cell outgrowths are very rare. The humanized gland       are also used to influence the tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells. We are investigating       alternative approaches to enhance epithelial cell growth such as the addition of primary human       macrophages. Preliminary results show a significantly higher number of epithelial outgrowths       in the presence of macrophages. Additionally, we have successfully isolated human mammary       extracellular matrix. This will be useful: 1. In vivo to replace Matrigel with a more       physiological matrix; 2. to study the epithelial/tumor cells in response to ECM proteins       derived from specific subsets of the population (for example: age, race, parity); 3. to study       matrix composition/interactions from a specific tumor subset (for example: Her2 or BRCA).       Cancer stem cells: Recent data suggest that solid tumors are initiated and propagated by a       rare population of cells that are unique from the tumor bulk in their ability to self-renew       indefinitely, give rise to heterogeneous lineages and form tumors. In the breast, this       population of cancer initiating cells has been prospectively identified as CD44+ and CD24-/dim       while CD24+ cells are considered to be of a terminally differentiated luminal subtype. We have       definitively illustrated, contrary to data in the literature, that (1) the presence of       CD44+CD24- cells in a pleural effusion (PE) does not ensure that the PE can give rise to       tumors in NOD/SCID mice, (2) in both PE and xenograft tumors, CD44+CD24- and CD44+CD24+ are       equally tumorigenic and can give rise to each other and (3) CD44+CD24- cells do not faithfully       recapitulate the CD44/CD24 profile of the PE in the resulting xenograft. Of 8 clinical       samples, only 1 PE behaved as predicted based on the data of Al-Hajj et al. As few as 200       CD44+CD24- cells gave rise to tumors whereas 5,000 CD44+CD24+ cells failed to give rise to       tumors. Contrary to these observations, CD44+CD24+ cells from several PEs were capable of       initiating tumors. Furthermore, CD44+CD24- cells from 3 additional PEs failed to give rise to       tumors even after 11 months. In xenografts derived from PEs and a primary tumor fragment,       CD44+CD24- and CD44+CD24+ cells were consistently equally tumorigenic. CD44- cells are       non-tumorigenic regardless of their source (i.e. PE vs. xenografts). With one exception that       was ER+PR+HER2-, all tumors examined were of a basal phenotype (ER-, PR-, HER2+/-). In all       cases, the receptor status of the primary tumor/PE was identical to that of its resulting       xenograft. However, PE cells and their xenografts had markedly disparate CD24 profiles.       Pleural effusions that had substantial C24- populations gave rise to xenografts that were       largely CD24+. In all xenografts examined, the xenograft immunophenotype remained static after       numerous passages. We have recently begun efforts to employ lentiviral mediated, doxycycline       inducible shRNA production to knockdown expression of CD44. We have achieved a 4-fold       reduction in CD44 protein abundance and a concomitant 6.8 fold increase in the percentage of       CD44- cells in the MCF10 Ca1a.c11 cell line. While statistically significant, the biological       relevance (i.e. in vivo tumorigenicity) of this knockdown is questionable given that even       after shRNA induction, the fraction of CD44+ cells remains approximately 3.5%. Established       Breast Cancer Cell Lines: Similarly, in breast cancer cell lines of three subtypes       (ER+PR+HER2-, ER+PR+HER2+, and ER-PR-HER2-) CD44+CD24- and CD44+CD24+ cells are equally       tumorigeniic at the orthotopic site with very low numbers. In vitro, however, CD24- cells       possess markers characteristic of epithelial-mesenchymal transition. CD24- cells have elevated       levels of Vimentin and Slug, reduced levels of E-cadherin, and increased invasiveness relative       to isogenic CD24+ cells. Strikingly, CD24- cells give rise to less invasive CD24+ progeny as       effectively as CD24+ cells give rise to more invasive CD24- progeny. These observations       demonstrate that acquisition of CD24 expression is not permanent and not all progeny of CD24+       cells express the marker. While functionally different in vitro, in vivo tumorigenicity is       similar between CD24- and CD24+ populations. Additionally, the ability to recapitulate       functional heterogeneity, considered a key hallmark of the cancer stem cell, is shared by both       CD44+CD24+ and CD44+CD24- cells. In summary, our observations suggest that in the majority of       clinical samples and established breast cancer cell lines, cells lacking CD44 are largely       non-tumorigenic, but CD24+ cells and CD24- cells are equally tumorigenic. We have also       observed that cells enriched for tumorsphere forming ability are not enriched for CIC. Efforts       to identify novel extracellular markers capable of enriching CIC are currently underway.","250293",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can be proliferated indefinitely while retaining a normal karyotype, and can be used in vitro to study the earliest stages of differentiation. While in vitro studies (drug testing, target identification) may ultimately be medically more valuable than in vivo applications, it is the latter that has captured our imagination. The decision to fund research on hESCs opens up unprecedented opportunities. Public funding takes the research out of the private sector, where it has been motivated solely by economic necessities, into the public sector, where it can be performed without the driving force of the marketplace. The course proposed in this application, ""CHOC Human Embryonic Stem Cell Culture Training Course"", is a continuation of our current successful course which provides hands-on training for investigators to learn how to culture, manipulate, and differentiate hESCs in vitro. This course brings together some of the leading experts on hESC technology and through comparative approaches, effectively trains students in the successful culture, maintenance and manipulation of hESCs using lines WA01 and WA09 from the NIH hESC Registry. A major long term goal for this course has been to share and improve standard protocols. Specifically, this course aims are: 1) Demonstration of proper growth conditions for cells; 2) Proper freeze-thaw cycling and preparation of cell passages; 3) Use of co-culture techniques; 4) Use of cell separation procedures; 5) Review of basic good laboratory practices for use of human biological materials; 6) Development of protocols that support the characterization of embryonic stem cells; 7) Application of standard research protocols for directed differentiation of embryonic stem cells; 8) Employment of standard detection methods for infectious organisms or other contaminants; and 9) Cross-training of techniques used in other applications of stem cell biology. These aims are accomplished by offering intensive 10-day ""immersion"" courses to 12 participants chosen for their outstanding research potential and commitment to institute hESC research in their own laboratories. In addition, the future courses will each conclude with a day-long symposium, ""Cellular Therapies in Pediatric Diseases"", designed to highlight the clinical goals and obstacles for hESC research. This symposium, which focuses primarily on pediatric diseases, will be open to the general public as well as biomedical researchers and clinicians and, for the latter, will provide Continuing Medical Education credits. The courses are held annually in the Spring at the National Human Neural Stem Cell Resource of the Neuroscience Laboratories at the Children's Hospital of Orange County Research Institute.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Histopathology of ARDS is defined as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD).  Antemortem evidence for fibroproliferation directly correlates with risk of death in ARDS, and postmortem findings in the lungs of patients who died of ARDS demonstrate increased fibroproliferation.  Fibroblasts are the major cellular source of extracellular matrix.  However, the origin of the interstitial fibroblast that contributes to fibrosing alveolitis during DAD remains to be elucidated. Our preliminary data demonstrates that circulating fibrocytes play a significant role in promoting the fibrosing alveolitis of Acute lung injury (ALI).  We hypothesize that circulating fibrocytes, mobilized from a bone marrow (BM) precursor cell, extravasate into the lung by a chemokine-dependent (CXCL12/CXCR4) mechanism, differentiate to tissue myofibroblasts, and contribute to fibroproliferative response of ALI.  To test this hypothesis, we will perform experiments in the following Specific Aims I. A) To determine the origin of circulating fibrocytes and whether they are derived from a BM progenitor cell.  B) To demonstrate that the temporal mobilization of BM progenitor fibrocytes, extravasation of circulating fibrocytes, and differentiation into myofibroblasts directly correlates with the fibroproliferative phase of ALI.  II. A) To determine whether factor(s) generated in the lung promote mobilization of BM precursor fibrocytes and increase the pool of circulating fibrocytes during ALI.  B) To establish that the temporal expression of CXCL12 directly correlates with the kinetics of extravasating fibrocytes in the lung during ALI.  C) To ascertain whether homing and extravasation of circulating fibrocytes into the lung during ALI is dependent on CXCL12/CXCR4.  D) To establish whether combined inhibition of BM precursor fibrocyte mobilization and recruitment of circulating fibrocytes leads to additive or synergistic attenuation of the fibroproliferative response during ALI.  III. A) To establish whether hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) regulates the expression of CXCR4 on BM progenitor fibrocytes and circulating fibrocytes.  B) To determine whether fibrocytes derived from BM precursor cells genetically HIF-1alpha null or von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (VHL) null correlate with altered CXCR4 expression and recruitment to the lung during ALI.  IV. A) To ascertain whether chemokine signaling through phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is critical to fibrocyte migration, proliferation, and survival in vitro.  B) To determine whether fibrocytes derived from BM precursor cells genetically devoid of PI3K (PI3Kgamma-/-) have impaired homing, extravasation, proliferation, and survival in the lung during ALI.  The findings of these studies may lead to novel intervention to attenuate the fibroproliferation and reduce morbidity and mortality related to ARDS.

Project Narrative
 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of the lung that leads
to loss of normal structure/function and permanent scarring of the lung tissue. The
incidence of IPF in the U.S. population is 30/100,000. Currently, the natural cause of IPF
is unknown, and there are no effective treatments with a median survival of 2.8-4.2 yrs.
The studying the function of miRNAs has made huge impact on several critical disease,
such as lung cancer, diabetes and heart failure. Nothing, however, is known about
miRNAs in IPF. We have previously reported critical components of the microRNA
machinery in the developing lungs. Our preliminary studies have identified several
microRNAs selectively enriched in the embryonic and adult lung. Here we hypothesize
that IPF may have cell type specific miRNA expression signatures, and that
characterizing these signatures may provide the basis for the identification of disease

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
Abstract:  Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of the lung that may lead to loss of normal structure/function and permanent scarring of the lung tissue. The cellular and molecular changes that lead to the development of this condition are still largely unknown. There is emerging literature showing that miRNAs play essential roles in normal development and in diseases, such as lung development and lung cancer, diabetes and heart failure. Nothing, however, is known about miRNAs in IPF. We have previously reported critical components of the microRNA machinery in the developing lungs. Our preliminary studies have identified several microRNAs selectively enriched in the embryonic and adult lung. Here we hypothesize that IPF may have cell type specific miRNA expression signatures, and that characterizing these signatures may provide the basis for the identification of disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We propose that miRNA signatures can be identified and further characterized by utilizing the tissues from Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) and methodologies already established in our group. Two specific Aims are proposed for this study: Aim 1: to identify miRNAs significantly down- or up-regulated in lung tissue from IPF patients compared to control non-affected lungs by using miRNA microarray. Aim 2: to characterize the expression pattern of these miRNAs in histological sections from IPF patients and compare with control morphologically normal lungs by using in situ hybridization. Results from these studies may provide novel insights into the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of IPF, and help to design strategies for its diagnosis and management. (End of Abstract)  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   
  
Project Narrative Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of the lung that leads to loss of normal structure/function and permanent scarring of the lung tissue. The incidence of IPF in the U.S. population is 30/100,000. Currently, the natural cause of IPF is unknown, and there are no effective treatments with a median survival of 2.8-4.2 yrs. The studying the function of miRNAs has made huge impact on several critical disease, such as lung cancer, diabetes and heart failure. Nothing, however, is known about miRNAs in IPF. We have previously reported critical components of the microRNA machinery in the developing lungs. Our preliminary studies have identified several microRNAs selectively enriched in the embryonic and adult lung. Here we hypothesize that IPF may have cell type specific miRNA expression signatures, and that characterizing these signatures may provide the basis for the identification of disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We propose that miRNA signatures can be identified and further characterized by using microRNA array and in situ hybridization approaches and utilizing the tissues from Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC).

pathways and machinery of cell motility, processes for which small-molecule inhibitors are presently
 limited, with the goal of discovering new probes and proteins involved in cell migration. In addition to their
 great value as tools for basic biomedical research, small molecules that modulate cell migration may be of
 direct therapeutic importance. Anti-migratory compounds have great potential as anti-cancer agents, since
both tumor angiogenesis and metastasis depend on cell migration. Using a combination of chemical and
 cellular approaches, we have previously shown that Rac,phosphoinositides and c-Jun N-terminal kinase
are essential for cell migration during epithelial wound closure. We have discovered a number of new
small-molecule inhibitors of cell migration, among the most potent inhibitors of cell motility known. The
 proposed research involves the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of four of these new inhibitors and
the role of their cellular protein targets in the control of cell migration. Using binding assay-guided target
purification, we have already identified the cellular protein targets of two of these compounds, and this
proposal deals in part with characterization of these proteins as drug targets and modulators of cell
 migration. Specifically, we have discovered one compound that targets the signaling molecule Raf kinase
 inhibitor protein (RKIP) and acts by perturbing a critical protein-protein interaction, a relatively rare mode of
 action for a small-molecule inhibitor. In the process of validating RKIP as a relevant target, we have also
found that RKIP positively regulated cell migration, and its overexpression results in a striking cancer-like
 transition of epithelial cells to a highly migratory fibroblast-like phenotype. Another of our new cell migration
 inhibitors specifically binds the membrane/cytoskeleton adaptor and signaling scaffold protein radixin. We
will expand upon these findings. We will also synthesize analogs of the other two highly potent cell
 migration inhibitors we have discovered for structure-activity relationship studies, followed by preparation of
affinity derivatives, isolation and identification of their specific cellular targets and determination of their
 molecular and cellular mechanisms of action.
Cancer treatment has traditionally focused on trying to stop the ability of cancer cells to multiply. However,
the development of malignant cancers also involves the migration of cells from one location to another,
particularly when tumor cells migrate to form secondary tumor masses. We have discovered new drugs
that prevent cells from migrating, and now we seek to find out how they do so in the hope of learning how
 cell migration is controlled and how to limit it.","23315",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main goal of this proposal is to understand how epithelia are formed in the roundworm C. elegans. Epithelial structures perform many necessary roles in the body, such as acting as barriers (e.g.: skin) or forming transport tubules (e.g. gut, blood vessels, etc.). To execute these diverse functions, epithelial cells must be highly polarized with distinct membrane domains. The regulation of epithelial polarity is of high importance, as dysregulation can result in human disease. For example, Wilms' Tumor, a childhood cancer, can be caused by a mutation in the Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) gene. WT1 mutant mice fail to form a complete kidney due to a defect in epithelium formation. In addition, the loss of epithelial polarity may contribute to cancer metastasis. Thus, it is crucial to determine the genes that regulate epithelial polarization. The current view is that the adhesion protein E-cadherin is necessary to initiate and maintain epithelial polarity. However, a cadherin-independent pathway that initiates epithelial polarization has been uncovered in many systems, including vertebrates. For example, the serine/threonine kinase LKB1 is sufficient to polarize single human intestine cells in the absence of cadherin-mediated signaling. In addition, C. elegans mutants lacking a functional cadherin still have polarized epithelia. To elucidate the mechanism of this cadherin-independent pathway, the Mango lab performed a genetic screen to discover mutants that fail to generate a foregut epithelium. Surprisingly, this screen identified regulators of cytokinesis, the central-spindlin components ZEN-4/kinesin and CYK-4/GAP. The failure to form a foregut epithelium resulted from a defect in polarity and not in cytokinesis. Further work from the Mango lab showed that CYK-4 regulates RhoA activity and actomyosin contractility to initiate polarization of the C. elegans zygote. This proposal aims to 1) Test the intriguing hypothesis that formation of a foregut epithelium requires the same genes that act to polarize the one-cell embryo and 2) Perform a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify new genes regulating epithelium formation. In the first aim I will use fluorescently-tagged proteins and microscopy to document carefully the events during polarization of the foregut epithelium. I will also determine at which step ZEN-4 and CYK-4 act, and perform mutant analysis to generate a genetic pathway for epithelium formation. In the second aim, the unbiased, genome-wide RNAi screen for novel regulators of epithelial polarization will involve feeding dsRNA-expressing bacteria to knock-down gene expression. Positive candidates will be analyzed in detail to discover their role in establishing polarity. These results will add to our knowledge of this basic cell biological process and may identify therapeutic targets for human disease.

Basement membranes are the first extracellular matrix to appear in development and are critical for organ development and tissue repair. They not only provide the scaffold for cells and cell layers, but they also have an essential role in morphogenesis that affects cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Basement membranes consist of collagen IV, laminin, perlecan, nidogen/entactin, and other molecules, which interact with each other to form the supramolecular structure.

Perlecan is a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan in basement membranes and in some other tissues, such as cartilage. Perlecan consists of a 400-kDa protein core, which can be divided into 5 distinct domains, designated I-V. The protein core contains covalently attached glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains at the N- and C-terminal domains. Perlecan interacts with extracellular molecules, growth factors, and cell surface receptors and is implicated in many biological functions in tissue development, homeostasis, and disease. In order to identify the role of perlecan in development, we previously created perlecan knockout (Perl-/-) mice. Some Perl-/- mice die around embryonic day (E) 10.5, and those that survive die perinatally because of a respiratory problem. The Perl-/- mice that survive to the perinatal stage show dwarfism with defective cartilage development. We previously  identified mutations of the perlecan gene in 2 human diseases: dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (DDSH), characterized by lethal chondrodysplasia, and Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (SJS), characterized by myotonia and milder chondrodysplasia. Perlecan-deficiency causes lethal chondrodysplasia in mice and humans, indicating that perlecan is essential for cartilage development. However, the role of perlecan in cartilage development was unknown. The Perl-/- growth plate was short, with severely impaired endochondral bone formation. We found a critical role for perlecan in FGF/VEGF signaling and vascular invasion during growth plate formation. Both FGFR1 and FGFR3 were activated in the Perl-/- growth plate. Expression of VEGF, an FGF/FGFR target gene, was upregulated by Perl-/- hypertrophic chondrocytes, suggesting that the lack of vascularization into the hypertrophic zone is not due to reduced VEGF expression. Our results suggest that impaired endochondral ossification is in part due to defects of vascular invasion into cartilage in the absence of perlecan. 

Animal models are useful to determine the roles of perlecan in adult tissue functions and diseases. However, the lethal phenotype of Perl-/- mice has hampered these studies. To overcome this problem, we created perinatal lethality-rescued Perl-/- (Perl-/-;TgPerl) mice by expressing the perlecan transgene specifically to cartilage under the control of the Col2a1 promoter. The mutant mice survived and developed myotonia, showing a continuous discharge by electromyography and degeneration of muscle and can be used to develop therapeutic reagents for myotonia. Perlecan is implicated in angiogenesis, wound repair, tumor growth, and metastasis. Activities of perlecan in these biological processes often vary depending on tissues and cell types used for the study and are sometimes controversial, in part because wild-type or mutant perlecan is present in these experimental systems. Therefore, Perl-/-;TgPerl mice, which lack perlecan in most tissues, should be useful for defining the real role of perlecan in pathogenesis and tissue regeneration. To examine whether the host perlecan affects tumor growth, we injected Lewis lung carcinoma tumors subcutaneously into Perl-/-;TgPerl mice. We found that tumor growth was faster in Perl-/-;TgPerl mice than in control mice. Heterozygous mice (Perl+/-;TgPerl) developed intermediate-sized tumors. These data suggest that host perlecan inhibits tumor growth. We found that wound healing was accelerated in mutant mice in skin-punch assays. Increased tumor growth and accelerated wound healing were accompanied by an increase in angiogenesis. This may be caused by an increase in availability and/or expression of growth factors in the absence of perlecan. It is also conceivable that cells can migrate faster in perlecan-deficient matrix. 

During our project on perlecan, we created transgenic mice expressing recombinant perlecan. We found that one of the transgenic mouse lines developed severe tremors in the hindlimbs around 4 weeks after birth. Essential tremor, a human nerve disorder in which tremors (shakes) occur without an identifiable cause when a person is moving or trying to move, is the most common tremor disorder, and it is the most prevalent movement disorder worldwide. It is 20 times more common than Parkinson's disease. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings, and treatment is mainly for symptoms. Since the tremor mice might be a useful animal model for understanding essential tremor disorder, we wanted to identify the causative gene. We found that the transgene was inserted into intron 14 of the Odz4 gene. Odz4 is a transmembrane protein that is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), but its function is not known. Odz4 and the transgene were not expressed in the CNS of mutant mice. The absence of Odz4 resulted in hypomyelination in the spine, causing a reduced number of oligodendrocytes and degeneration of neurons, which likely led to the tremor phenotype observed in the homozygous mutant mice.","705186",

Identification of tumor antigens is essential in       advancing immune-based therapeutic interventions in cancer. Particularly attractive targets       are those molecules that are selectively expressed by malignant cells and that are also       essential for tumor progression. We used a computer-based differential display analysis tool       for mining of expressed sequence tag clusters in the human Unigene database and identified       Brachyury as a novel tumor antigen. Brachyury, a member of the T-box transcription factor       family, is a key player in mesoderm specification during embryonic development. Moreover,       transcription factors that control mesoderm have been implicated in the epithelial-mesenchymal       transition (EMT), which has been postulated to be a key step during tumor progression to       metastasis. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis validated the in silico predictions and showed       Brachyury expression in tumors of the small intestine, stomach, kidney, bladder, uterus,       ovary, and testis, as well as in cell lines derived from lung, colon, and prostate carcinomas,       but not in the vast majority of the normal tissues tested. An HLA-A0201epitope of human       Brachyury was identified that was able to expand T lymphocytes from blood of cancer patients       and normal donors with the ability to lyse Brachyury-expressing tumor cells. To our knowledge,       this is the first demonstration that (a) a T-box transcription factor and (b) a molecule       implicated in mesodermal development, i.e., EMT, can be a potential target for human T-cell       mediated cancer immunotherapy. The Interleukin-2 immunotoxin denileukin diftitox reduces       regulatory T cells and enhances vaccine-mediated T-cell immunity. CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T regulatory       cells (Treg cells) have been implicated in the lack of effective antitumor immunity.       Denileukin diftitox (DAB389IL-2), a fusion protein of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and diphtheria       toxin, provides a means of targeting Treg cells. In this study, we examined (1) the effect of       denileukin diftitox on the deletion of Treg cells in various lymphoid compartments and (2) the       dose scheduling of denileukin diftitox in combination with a recombinant poxviral vaccine to       enhance antigen-specific immune responses. Treg cells in spleen, peripheral blood, and bone       marrow of normal C57BL/6 mice were variously reduced after a single intraperitoneal injection       of denileukin diftitox; the reduction was evident within 24 hours and lasted approximately 10       days. Injection of denileukin diftitox 1 day before vaccination enhanced antigen-specific       T-cell responses above levels induced by vaccination alone. These studies show for the first       time in a murine model (1) the differential effects of denileukin diftitox on Treg cells in       different cellular compartments, (2) the advantage of combining denileukin diftitox with a       vaccine to enhance antigen-specific T-cell immune responses, (3) the lack of inhibition by       denileukin diftitox of host immune responses directed against a live viral vector, and (4) the       importance of dose scheduling of denileukin diftitox when used in combination with a vaccine.","541259",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Transdifferentiation has become a common claim for somatic stem cells, yet how this is accomplished has not been well investigated. Although much evidence exists that somatic stem cells can change their protein phenotype, it is not clear what mechanisms are involved, and whether the stem cells actually change their function and maintain this change. To investigate the mechanisms of transdifferentiation, we propose to use two cell types with distinct characteristics and functions: the epidermal stem cell (EpiSC) and the B lymphocyte. EpiSCs express the intermediate filaments keratins 5 and 14 and form sheets of cells connected by adherens and desmosomal junctions. B lymphocytes, in contrast, do not express keratin intermediate filaments. They express a defined set of cell surface proteins with well-studied kinetics of expression. In order for a B lymphocyte to produce a specific immunoglobulin, it must incur a permanent genetic change. This involves deletion and rearrangement of VDJ segments in their immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. This rearrangement is mediated by the RAG1 and RAG2 recombinase enzymes, and by the Pax5-encoded transcription factor BSAP (B cell specific activator protein). EpiSCs do not exhibit VDJ rearrangement; express the RAG1, RAG2, or Pax5 gene; or produce immunoglobulin. Our preliminary data suggest that EpiSCs can be directed to express the B lymphocyte cell markers and genes, and show rearrangement of VDJ segments. We hypothesize that EpiSCs are developmentally flexible, i.e. that they can be directed to produce cells of alternate lineages. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1, we propose to direct EpiSCs (marked with 2gal) to transdifferentiate into B lymphocytes. We will verify that individual EpiSCs did transdifferentiate by detection of B cell surface markers and recombinase enzyme genes, and by PCR analysis for VDJ rearrangement in 2gal-expressing cells. Since permanency of the transdifferentiation event is important for future therapy, we will test whether or not EpiSCs that alter their cell lineage remain transdifferentiated when removed from the B cell inductive environment. In Aim 2, we will attempt to determine the mechanism(s) by which individual EpiSCs transdifferentiate. Our preliminary findings indicate that EpiSCs require direct contact with the S17 stromal cells in order to transdifferentiate. We hypothesize that S17 cells induce EpiSCs to alter their lineage via receptor- ligand interaction(s). We will test this hypothesis by examining the membranes of EpiSCs, before and during co-culture with S17 cells, for the expression of candidate receptor-ligand pairs. Since the skin is the largest organ with potentially the greatest number of stem cells, understanding the mechanism behind transdifferentiation of these cells is a step toward their use in tissue regeneration. Many diseases, including diabetes, Alzheimer's, and heart disease, are caused by the death of cells in major organs. To treat these diseases, the lost cells must be replaced, ideally with autologous cells. Such cells will have to be induced to change their lineage and engraft into a new environment, a process collectively called transdifferentiation. Stem cells from the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin, offer advantages over other types of adult stem cells in that they can be isolated with little harm to the individual and, since the skin is the largest organ in the body, they are present in large quantities. Therefore, determining the mechanism behind transdifferentiating epidermal stem cells and their potential for tissue regeneration has clinical significance.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The molecular basis of terminal nephron differentiation, the process by which immature renal epithelial cells exit the cell cycle and express physiological functions, remains obscure. Failure of terminal nephron differentiation results in renal dysplasia, cystogenesis and cancer. Thus, a better understanding of the transcriptional framework which regulates renal cell differentiation is of great clinical significance. The tumor suppressor protein, p53, is a member of a family of transcription factors that regulate cellular growth, differentiation, senescence and apoptosis, and play a key role in cell fate determination during development and in response to stress. During the previous funding period, we demonstrated that p53 and its homologue p73 act as master transcriptional regulators upstream of genes required for terminal nephron differentiation; this function of p53/p73 is accomplished via cooperation with other developmentally regulated transcription factors and recruitment of co-activators or co-repressors. Consistent with this role, p53 -/- mice exhibit defects in terminal nephron differentiation, which can be reproduced by kidney-specific deletion/inactivation of p53. The overall goal of this competing grant renewal is to elucidate the mechanisms governing p53 activation and commitment to promote the terminal differentiation fate in the developing kidney. We will use a variety of in vivo genetic and biochemical approaches, together with an in vitro organ culture system, to test a model in which Mdm2 and other negative regulators of p53 exert strict spatiotemporal control on p53 during terminal nephron differentiation. We propose that p53 is preferentially required to execute a differentiation program in the ureteric bud cell lineage, and that this function is orchestrated and deciphered by distinct acetylation and phosphorylation cassettes which differentially influence gene expression patterns and thus cell fate. Investigations of how p53 is regulated during development and how p53 executes its differentiation functions are important basic steps toward understanding the genetic control of organogenesis. The proposed studies have important clinical implications as abnormal renal development is the leading cause of chronic renal failure in infants and children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal addresses a critical step in kidney development related to the cellular and molecular events that control the transition of immature kidney cells to become differentiated and functional. Abnormalities of kidney development (i.e., congenital malformations) account for up to 40% of cases of chronic kidney failure in infants and children requiring dialysis and transplantation. Understanding how kidney epithelial cells transition from an immature to a more differentiated fate should provide insights into novel treatments of important diseases including kidney malformations, cancer, and recovery from acute kidney injury.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Esophageal cancer represents the 5th most frequent cancer in males worldwide. Given the poor survival rate, advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis and the increasing frequency of the disease it is increasingly important to understand the molecular mechanisms of initiation of these tumors as well as the genes involved in their metastasis. My research will focus on the catenin family member p120ctn and its ability to modulate tumorigenesis as well as cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. p120ctn defines a family of catenin proteins related to beta-catenin that also bind to E-cadherin and stabilizes E-cadherin at adherens junctions. As a result, expression of E-cadherin and p120ctn appear to be coordinately regulated in many cell lines and it is speculated that this may be another mechanism by which E-cadherin expression may be lost and lead to EMT. Interestingly, p120ctn contains 16 different phosphorylation sites, 8 tyrosine and 8 serine/threonine. What kinases directly phosphorylate these sites and under what stimuli are largely unknown. However, it is clear that EGFR activation can induce phosphorylation of p120ctn at least at Y228. Additionally, many splice forms for p120ctn exist. We hypothesize that the different isoforms and phosphorylation sites of p120ctn may regulate its ability to interact with its binding partners and therefore alter its ability to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis. This hypothesis will be pursued by the following interrelated specific aims. Aim 1: To assess the effects different isoforms and phosphorylation mutants have on motility and invasiveness. Expression of p120ctn will be knocked-down in several esophageal cell lines. Various isoforms and phosphorylation-deficient mutants will be introduced and motility and invasiveness of the mutants will be determined through monolayer assays as well as three-dimensional Matrigel and organotypic culture models. Aim2: To understand the role of p120ctn in tumor initiation and progression. We will overexpress EGFR and knockdown p120ctn expressin in vivo and in vitro. We will monitor these EGFR-overexpressing, p120ctn-deleted mice and cell lines for esophageal tumorigenesis and metastasis. Over 14,000 new cases of esophageal cancer were diagnosed in the United States last year and more than 90% of those diagnosed will die of their disease, primarily from metastatic lesions. The proposed studies will provide novel insights into the biological roles of p120ctn in the development and progression of esophageal cancer. Ultimately, these studies may translate into new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for this deadly disease.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Slug transcription factor modulates the complete or partial conversion of sessile epithelial cells into migrating fibroblast-like cells during embryonic development, wound healing, and carcinogenesis. During the course of our studies examining the role of Slug in ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced skin tumor progression, we made the unexpected observation that Slug knock- out (KO) mice are resistant to the acute inflammatory effects of UVR on the skin: edema, erythema, neutrophil influx, and epidermal necrosis. Our preliminary studies indicate that a major defect in the acute UVR response of Slug knockout mice is failure of neutrophil recruitment into the skin and suggest that the defect lies in altered release of proinflammatory mediators from UVR-exposed knockout keratinocytes rather than in defects in dermal mast cell or circulating neutrophil number or function. To distinguish the role of Slug in the epidermis from its role in the neutrophil, we will construct bone marrow chimeric and conditional KO mice that lack Slug activity in the epidermis but have wild type (WT) hematopoietic cells and determine if their cutaneous inflammatory response to UVR exposure differs from that of mice with WT epidermis. Production of inflammatory modulators by epidermal keratinocytes will be assessed using microarrays to determine if there is aberrant production of proinflammatory mediators by UVR- exposed Slug KO keratinocytes. The ability of Slug KO neutrophils to migrate in response to chemotactic signals will be assayed in vitro to identify possible deficits in adhesion and migration of these cells. Our studies will provide insight into the identity of genes under transcriptional control of Slug that are key to a robust local inflammatory response. This represents the first investigation of a novel role for the Slug transcription factor in modulating the acute inflammatory response. Slug may represent a new target for therapeutic control of acute inflammation, and the present studies will provide the foundation for more detailed investigations of this possibility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sunlight induces both acute skin damage (sunburn) and long term skin damage (skin cancer). The role of the Slug transcription factor in promoting skin cancer development has been documented, and we have preliminary data suggesting an unexpected but important role for Slug in modulating sunburn.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), a life-threatening birth defect, is a major cause of pediatric mortality and mobility. The pathological anomalies are characterized by the inappropriate protrusion of the abdominal contents, possibly including the stomach, liver, intestines and spleen, through an improperly formed diaphragm into the thoracic cavity which impairs lung growth and development. In addition to the secondary defect resulting from protrusion of abdominal contents, lung development itself may be also effected and contribute to CDH phenotypes in these patients. Although the disease was described more than 350 years ago, the etiology of CDH is poorly understood. Using a conditional null mutant in which COUP-TFII is deleted in the mesentery, we showed that tissue specific null mutants of COUP-TFII exhibit Bochdalek CDH, the most common form of CDH. COUP-TFII, a member of orphan nuclear receptors, is expressed in regions critical for the formation of the diaphragm and lung during embryonic development. Ablation of COUP-TFII in the foregut mesenchyme, including the post-hepatic mesenchymal plate (PHMP), results in the malformation of the diaphragm and the failure of appropriate attachment of the PHMP to the body wall. Recently a critical region within 15q26.1-26.2 has been mapped by array CGH and Fish analysis to be deleted in CDH patients. COUP-TFII is one of the four known genes resided within this critical region. Together with results of our COUP-TFII conditional mutants, the genetic analysis implicates COUP-TFII as most likely candidate gene for the most common type of Bochdalek CDH. To delineate how COUP-TFII regulates diaphragm and lung development and how perturbation of proper diaphragm formation might result in CDH, three specific aims are proposed: 1). Analysis of the defects exhibited by the conditional null mice during diaphragm development; 2). Analyze the role of COUP-TFII in lung development and its relationship to CDH; 3). Screen and characterize COUP-TFII mutations in CDH patients. With the proposed study, we hope to provide important insights on morphogenesis of the diaphragm and lung and how malformation of these organs leads to such devastating congenital defects. And eventually, by screening CDH patients for the mutations in COUP-TFII, it will certainly improve the translational prospect in setting up a diagnostic kit and devise an intervention for some CDH patients.

suppressor in early carcinogenesis, and in stimulating invasion leading to metastasis. Most carcinomas
have a deregulated response to TGF-beta, leading to inactivation of the antiproliferative response to TGF-
beta. In some cases this deregulation is associated with mutations in the type I or type II TGF-beta
receptors. Sumoylation, i.e. the covalent attachment of a ubiquitin-like SUMO protein, is an emerging
posttranslational modification of various proteins. The role of sumoylation is often unpredictable and seems
to depend on the target protein. Possible recruitment of SUMO-interacting proteins may lead to changes in
the protein complex formation and functional properties of the target protein. Sumoylation is largely
characterized as a modification of transcription factors and proteins involved in nuclear functions, and
sumoylation of cell surface receptors has not been reported. We recently discovered that the type I TGF-
beta receptor, TbRI, is sumoylated, making us hypothesize that sumoylation regulates the function of this
receptor, and consequently TGF-beta signaling and the cell's response to TGF-beta. After identifying the
sumoylation site in TbRI, we also found that a point mutation in TbRI, which has been found in association
with metastatic breast cancer, confers a lack of sumoylation to TbRI. This leads to the hypothesis that
sumoylation of the TbRI affects autocrine TGF-beta signaling and is a determinant of the invasive behavior
of carcinomas.
 We propose three aims to define the molecular mechanism of TbRI sumoylation and its role in the
cellular responses to TGF-b and the behavior of cancer cells in vivo. Aim 1 will characterize the mechanism
of sumoylation of TbRI, including a search to identify the responsible E3 SUMO ligase. Aim 2 will examine
the effect of TbRI sumoylation on Smad and non-Smad signaling responses and the cell's proliferation and
invasion responses to TGF-b. This Aim should also define functional differences between the ""metastasis-
associated"" TbRI mutant, wild-type TbRI and a sumoylation-deficient TbRI point mutant in the signaling and
cell behavior responses to TGF-b. Finally, Aim 3 will define the effect of TbRI sumoylation and of the
""metastasis-associated"" TbRI point mutation on the behavior of cancer cells and on cancer progression in
vivo. The proposed studies should provide a basis for the characterization of the mechanism of the TGF-
beta receptor sumoylation, its role in the cell's response to TGF-beta and in cancer cell behavior and cancer
progression.","154209",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant disease that affects millions of people around the world. The major cause of patient death is by tumor metastasis. Thus, studying CRC metastasis is critically important not only for understanding mechanisms of tumor malignancy, but also for developing tools for early diagnosis and effective treatment. Metastasis of CRC emerges from multiple genetic alterations and cellular disorganization. It occurs in a phase of tumor progression by metastatic variant cells that possess invasive activities characterized by increased cell migration, tissue invasion, and organ colonization. Despite intensive studies, our knowledge about the nature of invasive cells and the mechanisms underlying their origination is still limited. Recent studies using DNA microarray analysis have revealed that the proclivity of CRC metastasis is acquired early during multistage tumorigenesis. It is manifested only at late stages aided with additional genetic aberrations or cellular disorganization. During the study of CRC progression towards malignancy, we found that splicing variants of the RON receptor tyrosine kinase, such as oncogenic RON160, play a critical role in priming CRC cells with metastatic capability. Increased RON160 expression in colonic cells not only mediates cell transformation, but also promotes malignant metastasis. Thus, RON160 seems to act as a regulated metastasis-promoting switch in CRC cells. The goal of this project is to determine the signaling mechanisms by which oncogenic RON variants regulate metastatic phenotypes of CRC cells. We believe that malignancy acquired by metastatic variants of CRC cells is determined by metastasis-related proteins including oncogenic RON160. We hypothesize that splicing RON variants, such as oncogenic RON160, have the priming effect on CRC cells resulting in increased metastatic capabilities. In other words, metastatic potential is driven by oncogenic RON variants that initiate and activate cellular motile/invasive machinery leading to metastatic processes. To test this hypothesis, our studies will focus on following three specific aims: 1) To study how oncogenic RON160 is expressed in primary and metastatic CRC samples and its role in priming CRC cells into highly malignant variants; 2) To determine the roles of RON160-activated signaling proteins and underlying mechanisms required for malignant conversion of CRC cells; and 3) To validate RON160 as a therapeutical target using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that exhibit growth-inhibitory and apoptotic effects on CRC cells. This work is important for the following reasons. First, it will determine the importance of RON160 in the progression of CRC cells towards malignancy. Second, it will facilitate our understanding of mechanisms underlying CRC metastasis. Finally, this work may identify novel targets for drug development to treat metastatic CRC.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANE:  Metastasis of colon cancer is the ultimate cause of patient death. Currently, our knowledge about tumor metastasis is very limited, which reflects the lack of effective treatment for this deadly disease at clinical practice. Thus, understanding how colon cancer metastasizes is critically important. The project in this grant application is to determine the role of a cellular protein called RON in colon cancer metastasis. It is believed that such studies will help to determine mechanisms underlying colon cancer metastasis, to identify novel metastatic markers for early diagnosis, and to develop new drugs to treat patients with metastatic colon cancer.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding the mechanisms that control chondrogenesis is of major clinical importance for improving tissue engineering strategies that can be applied to repair cartilage during osteoarthritis, for example. Studies proposed for the grant renewal period are focused on deciphering the regulation chondrogenesis at the level of gene transcription, precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) alternative splicing and protein synthesis. The following three Specific Aims will directly address these aspects of cartilage development: 1) Investigate the role of transcription factors during chondrogenesis, specifically AP-2, dEF-1 and C/EBP; 2) Investigate the regulation of the type II procollagen pre-mRNA switch that occurs during chondrogenesis and 3) Determine the function of the developmentally-expressed type IIA procollagen protein isoform in vivo. Combined data from these Specific Aims will provide unique insight into the regulation of chondrogenesis as it is becoming apparent that processes of transcription, RNA splicing and translation are tightly coordinated. We also plan to study mechanisms important for cartilage maintenance and repair as described in the fourth Specific Aim: 4) Investigate the mechanism of IL-1b and TNF-a induction of BMP-2 in adult chondrocytes. Processes that occur during chondrogenesis are believed to be recapitulated during tissue repair under conditions of cartilage degradation. Therefore, the final Specific Aim in combination with the first three Specific Aims focused on chondrogenesis will provide invaluable information into the maintenance of cartilage health. The predominant experimental approach to these topics will be to use in vitro systems of chondrogenesis utilizing the ATDC5 cell line and adult stem cells isolated from adipose tissue to investigate state-specific differentiation events. Regulatory factors will be tested by over expression and inhibition studies and correlated with expression in vivo.

Due to their malleable nature, BMSC possess multi-lineage potential and can overcome lineage restrictions
to form non-hematopoietic tissues including myocardium. There is unflinching evidence that mononuclear
cells emigrate from their bone marrow niches in response to tissue ischemia and become blood borne.
These cells show tropism for the ischemic myocardium where they undergo milieu dependent transformation
and develop into functioning cardiomyocytes. Our long term goal is to exploit BMSC as a therapeutic
modality to regenerate the infarcted myocardium and revamp the injured heart function. The proposed study
addresses some fundamental issues pertaining to both in vitro as well as in vivo fusion and
transdifferentiation potential of ischemically mobilized BMSC to form cardiac myocytes. We postulate that
ischemically stressed myocardium provides a strong trigger to initiate mobilization of specific sub-
populations of BMSC into peripheral circulation. The blood-borne cells home onto the injured
myocardium to adopt cardiac phenotvpes and improve cardiac function. Characterization of BMSC
committed to cardiac lineage will help to understand the basic mechanisms underlying BMSC mobilization
and differentiation both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Three main hypotheses fundamental to the proposed
project include: 1) ischemic stress mobilizes specific population of BMSC cells into peripheral
circulation: 2) Mobilized BMSC undergo milieu dependent differentiation into cardiomvocvtes and
endothelial cells to promote cardiomyogenesis and angiogenesis: 3) Mobilized BMSC protect
myocvtes against ischemia by secreting specific factors. The experimental design involves the use of
BMSC from transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein. Co-culture cell model will be
used to study the biology of BMSC in vitro. Their potential to differentiate into cardiac phenotypes in a
cardiac microenvironment using murine heart model of myocardial infarction will be examined. The effect of
ischemia on BMSC mobilization in peripheral circulation and finally their engraftment in the ischemic area will
be studied. The mechanism by which BMSC survive in the ischemic environment and protect myocytes will
be investigated by examining the molecular mediators, such as growth factors, cytokines, paracrine factors,
secreted by the BMSC. A broad multidisciplinary approach that will encompass diverse techniques including
histochemistry, immunocytochemistry, pathology, flow cytometric analysis, confocal microscopy and
molecular biology will be used to investigate the specific aims. A complete understanding of the ongoing
molecular processes in stem cell mediated regeneration is central to the success of cell derived-therapy.","372621",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Integrin a3b1 is an extracellular matrix receptor that is expressed in many malignant tumors and has been shown to regulate cellular phenotypes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 is also linked to malignant tumor growth, where it promotes tumor angiogenesis and cell invasion. a3b1 induces MMP-9 in immortalized keratinocytes (MK cells) through post-transcriptional mRNA stability, and this regulation is acquired during cellular immortalization. However, the mechanisms and signaling pathways whereby a3b1 regulates MMP-9 mRNA stability and their roles in tumor growth and progression are unknown. The goal of the proposed research is to answer these questions by exploiting a panel of a3b1-expressing (i.e. a3 wild type) and a3b1- deficient (i.e., a3-null) MK variants that collectively represent different EMT stages: (1) non-immortalized keratinocytes are isolated from neonatal epidermis; (2) immortalized MK cells harbor a p53-null mutation; (2) transformed MK cells additionally express oncogenic RasV12. Loss of p53 and oncogenic Ras activation are common mutations in squamous cell and other carcinomas. Preliminary data from this model indicate that a3b1 and MMP-9 are required for in vivo tumor growth of MK cells, and identify candidate signaling pathways and mechanisms whereby a3b1 may control MMP-9 mRNA stability. The proposed studies will test the hypotheses that MMP-9 mRNA expression is controlled by specific a3b1-mediated signaling pathways that control mRNA stability, and that these mechanisms control tumor growth in vivo. A combination of molecular, genetic, and biochemical approaches will be used to identify mRNA regulatory elements that control a3b1- dependent mRNA stability, and to elucidate specific signaling pathways or integrin functions that are involved in a3b1-mediated MMP-9 mRNA stability. An in vivo tumorigenesis model will be used to investigate the role of a3b1-dependent regulation of MMP-9 for tumor growth. Finally, the human relevance of these observations will be investigated by testing for a3b1-dependent regulation of MMP-9 in several human carcinoma lines, and by assessing expression of a3b1 and MMP-9 in human tumor specimens. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A key to the development of anti-cancer therapies is the identification of molecular targets that are required for tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. The proposed studies will identify novel molecular pathways that are turned on in cancer cells to promote malignant tumor growth and metastasis. These pathways may be exploitable as therapeutic targets.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Defects in the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signal transduction pathway are well-known in pancreatic cancer; the most well-established alteration is mutation of the Smad4, originally known as deleted in pancreatic cancer 4 (Dpc-4), which occurs in approximately 50% of human pancreatic cancers examined. TGF-beta binding to its transmembrane receptors leads to phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which form heterotrimeric complexes with Smad4 to inhibit growth of normal pancreatic epithelial cells. In pancreatic cancer cells, TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition is prevented either by loss of Smad4 or by inhibiting Smad-dependent growth arrest. Heider and colleagues recently reported that Smad- dependent growth arrest in pancreatic cancer cells is inhibited by overexpression of the protein Ski, a protein known to bind directly to Smads to inhibit signaling. Nine of 11 human pancreatic cancer specimens examined overexpressed Ski, which was not expressed in 9 normal pancreatic specimens. siRNA knockdown of Ski in Panc-1 cells restored TGF-beta-induced p21 expression and growth inhibition in culture and in a xenograft model (Heider et al., Annals of Surgery 246: 61-68, 2007). Over-expression of Ski also has been implicated in the cancer phenotype of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma and cervical carcinoma. We propose a pilot project to test the hypothesis that pharmacological disruption of the Ski-Smad interaction will restore TGF-beta signaling in Ski-overexpressing pancreatic cancer cells. We hope that these studies might lead to a novel therapeutic approach for treating some pancreatic cancers. We have identified small constrained peptides, called peptide aptamers, and one small molecule ligand that inhibits Smad3-Ski binding. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to optimize our initial aptamer reagents for disrupting Smad-Ski interactions in pancreatic cancer cells over-expressing Ski and to define the Ski protein binding ""hot spots"" on Smads. In Specific Aim 2, we propose to target the Ski-binding hot spots for discovery of additional small molecules ligands through screening of available chemical libraries. In Specific Aim 3, our initial active compound and additional drug-like chemicals from the Aim 2 screens will be optimized for their potency and selectivity in restoring TGF-beta growth inhibition in Ski-overexpressing human pancreatic cancer cells.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most pancreatic cancer patients treated with current therapies survive for only 3 to 6 months; the overall 5- year survival rate for this disease is <5%. We propose pre-clinical studies to evaluate a new therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer cells, the Ski-Smad protein interaction. We will use peptide aptamers and drug- like chemicals to disrupt Ski-Smad, restore an important growth inhibitory pathway in the pancreatic cancer cells, and provide proof-of-principle that Ski-Smad is a valid, druggable target for new drug development to aid pancreatic cancer patients.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a poor prognostic indicator and common final pathway in the development of end-stage renal disease irrespective of the underlying cause, ultimately leading to the destruction of renal tissue and irreversible loss of renal function. As the incidence of patients with newly diagnosed chronic kidney disease and ESRD is rising, sophisticated understanding of underlying mechanisms and identification of new molecular targets to control renal fibrogenesis is fundamental in the development of new therapies to reverse this disturbing trend. Peri-tubular capillary loss is a hallmark of progressive renal disease and results in reduced blood flow that limits oxygen delivery to the kidney leading to chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia. Key mediators of cellular adaptation to hypoxia are Hypoxia-Inducible-Factor (HIF)-1 and -2, basic-helix-loop- helix transcription factors, mostly known for their ability to regulate vascular remodeling, erythropoiesis, and energy metabolism. Here we hypothesize that hypoxia represents an early and initiating event in the development and progression of kidney disease, and that activation of HIF signaling promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and renal fibrogenesis. Because the biological functions of renal HIF-1 and HIF-2 appear to be cell-type dependent, we propose studies, which a) investigate the role of individual HIF transcription factors in the pathogenesis of progressive renal disease in a cell-type specific context in vivo and b) are aimed at the identification of relevant HIF regulated genes and signaling pathways. Specifically we propose studies, which include: a) animal models of progressive renal disease in conjunction with Cre-loxP mediated recombination to achieve cell-type specific inactivation of HIF-1a and HIF-2a, b) studies that examine specific HIF target genes and their role in EMT and fibrogenesis in vitro and in vivo, c) gene regulatory studies, and d) studies utilizing state of the art gene expression and promoter arrays to identify relevant HIF target genes. Overall, this grant aims at establishing a research program, which investigates the effects of HIF activation on the expression of genes and signaling networks that are critical in the development and progression of renal disease. The proposed studies will have immediate clinical implications as they strongly encourage therapies that aim at improving the balance between renal oxygen delivery and consumption to halt the progression of renal fibrosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This grant investigates the role of a low oxygen environment in the progression of chronic kidney disease. A main focus is on signaling through the Hypoxia-Inducible Factor (HIF) pathway. Identification and characterization of molecular pathways that are activated by hypoxia has the potential to provide the basis for new therapeutic approaches to halt the progression of renal scarring.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on the application of a chemical approach to understanding and controlling the pathways and machinery of cell motility, processes for which small-molecule inhibitors are presently limited, with the goal of discovering new probes and proteins involved in cell migration. In addition to their great value as tools for basic biomedical research, small molecules that modulate cell migration may be of direct therapeutic importance. Anti-migratory compounds have great potential as anti-cancer agents, since both tumor angiogenesis and metastasis depend on cell migration. Using a combination of chemical and cellular approaches, we have previously shown that Rac, phosphoinositides and c-Jun N-terminal kinase are essential for cell migration during epithelial wound closure. We have discovered a number of new small-molecule inhibitors of cell migration, among the most potent inhibitors of cell motility known. The proposed research involves the elucidation of the mechanisms of action of four of these new inhibitors and the role of their cellular protein targets in the control of cell migration. Using binding assay-guided target purification, we have already identified the cellular protein targets of two of these compounds, and this proposal deals in part with characterization of these proteins as drug targets and modulators of cell migration. Specifically, we have discovered one compound that targets the signaling molecule Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) and acts by perturbing a critical protein-protein interaction, a relatively rare mode of action for a small-molecule inhibitor. In the process of validating RKIP as a relevant target, we have also found that RKIP positively regulated cell migration, and its overexpression results in a striking cancer-like transition of epithelial cells to a highly migratory fibroblast-like phenotype. Another of our new cell migration inhibitors specifically binds the membrane/cytoskeleton adaptor and signaling scaffold protein radixin. We will expand upon these findings. We will also synthesize analogs of the other two highly potent cell migration inhibitors we have discovered for structure-activity relationship studies, followed by preparation of affinity derivatives, isolation and identification of their specific cellular targets and determination of their molecular and cellular mechanisms of action. Cancer treatment has traditionally focused on trying to stop the ability of cancer cells to multiply. However, the development of malignant cancers also involves the migration of cells from one location to another, particularly when tumor cells migrate to form secondary tumor masses. We have discovered new drugs that prevent cells from migrating, and now we seek to find out how they do so in the hope of learning how cell migration is controlled and how to limit it.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long-term goal of this proposal is to define signaling pathways that control oncogenic transformation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lung cancer cells. The secreted Wnt proteins, which signal through the Frizzled (Fz) family of seven transmembrane-spanning receptors, regulate developmental processes from Drosophila to man. Classically, Wnt/Fz binding triggers intermediate steps that result in stabilization and nuclear accumulation of the transcriptional co-activator, b-catenin, which interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors to activate target genes. The literature demonstrates that the Wnt pathway also becomes dysregulated through mutation and contributes to human cancers of diverse origin, especially colorectal cancer. Our recent work however reveals a novel finding that specific Wnt-Fzd interactions are capable of inhibiting cell growth, transformation, and reversing EMT (E-cadherin and MAPK are critical targets) by inducing mesenchymal to epithelial transitions (MET). While no activating mutations have been detected by our previous work in lung, an extensive repertoire of Wnt and Fz genes could yield various signaling targets which could engage both inhibitory and growth pathways in lung cancer cell lines. In this study we establish a possible role for the Wnt pathway in EMT and reduced transformed cell growth in NSCLC. We hypothesize that Wnt7a-Fzd 9 interactions will lead to pathways that contribute to reduced transformed growth of lung cancer cells and reversal of EMT by signaling through b-catenin/Tcf independent mechanisms.   
  
The research environment at UCHSC and mentoring from Dr. Heasley has led to my substantial development as a clinician-scientist. In fact, I believe that I have been well prepared for my next step as an independent investigator. My research career plans as well as my proposed research project are both fully described in the body of the grant.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
The Texas Medical Center Regional Coordinating Center for Heart Failure  
  
The proposed Texas Medical Center (TMC) Regional Coordinating Center (RCC) will be comprised of nine separate sites that are housed on the campus of the Texas Medical Center (www.tmc.edu), one of the largest incorporated medical centers in the world, with 42 not-for-profit institutions including 13 hospitals, two medical schools, two graduate schools of biomedical sciences, a dental school, four nursing schools, a school of public health, a college of pharmacy, a hospice facility, a geriatric center, a psychiatric center, and a forensic medical center, all located on the same campus. There are over 5,000,000 patient visits to the TMC, annually, which makes the TMC an ideal site to conduct clinical trials. Moreover, the racial and ethnic diversity within the TMC lends itself well to conducting clinical trials. The scientific and administrative base of this proposed RCC will be at Baylor College of Medicine. The nine sites in the TMC RCC are in close proximity to one another (see Figure 1), and most are attached by skywalks and tunnels that facilitate the interaction and collaboration between the sites. The patient characteristics, experience in clinical research in heart failure and enrollment capacity for heart failure clinical trials at each of the participating institutions is outstanding. Finally, the proposed TMC RCC has a number of unique features that are ideally suited for the NIH heart failure research network, including close proximity of all participating Institutions to one another such that a single research coordinator can recruit from all sites in the TMC network, sufficient racial diversity of the patient population to ensure adequate recruitment of minorities and women, a mixture of community and teaching hospitals, pediatric and adult hospitals, and specialty hospitals (e.g. MD Anderson), each of which has a very high patient volume for adult and pediatric heart failure. Finally the TMC RCC will be overseen by Dr. Douglas Mann, who has experience with phase I - IV clinical trials, and who has close working relationship with of the investigators in the proposed TMC RCC by virtue of his 14 year tenure in the Texas Medical Center.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cigarette smoking is strongly correlated with onset of lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases.  About 60% of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) arise as a result of smoking.  Nicotine and structurally related tobacco carcinogens like 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N'-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) have been found to induce the proliferation of cell lines derived from lung cancers.  In addition, these agents could induce angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and confer resistance to apoptosis.  These events are mediated through the activation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), and nAChRs have been detected in a variety of non-neuronal cells.  Nicotine by itself is not known to induce oncogenesis; but based on its ability to induce tumor growth and angiogenesis, we propose to study how nicotine affects the growth, progression and metastasis of non-small cell lung carcinomas.  Our recent results show that the scaffolding protein ¿-arrestin-1 plays a major role in mediating the proliferative signals of nAChRs and was necessary for activation of Src in response to nAChR stimulation.  Further, nicotine stimulation of A549 cells led to changes in the expression of genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).  Recent studies have shown that ¿-arrestin-1 plays a significant role in the metastasis of colorectal cancers.  Given this background, we will assess the role of ¿-arrestin-1 and Src in nicotine-induced cell proliferation, tumor cell invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis.  It has been reported that ¿-arrestin-1 translocates to the nucleus in response to G-protein coupled receptor signaling and activates multiple promoters; we find a similar nuclear translocation upon nicotine stimulation.  Our preliminary results show that nAChR stimulation of non-small cell lung carcinoma cells leads to transcriptional activation of promoters involved in proliferation and EMT; we will assess the contribution of ¿-arrestin-1 to this process.  Based on our finding that nicotine can promote the growth of non-small cell lung tumors in mice, we will examine whether nicotine promotes tumor progression and metastasis in three different mouse models.  Underlying mechanisms facilitating these processes will be elucidated, including the contribution of ¿-arrestin-1 and Src in nicotine-induced tumor metastasis. Since a majority of non-small cell lung carcinomas correlate with exposure to tobacco smoke, these studies will throw light on the molecular mechanisms by which nicotine affects the growth and progression of lung cancers.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Exposure to tobacco smoke is highly correlated with onset of lung cancer.  Though it is the direct effect of tobacco carcinogens that initiate tumor formation, exposure to nicotine might facilitate the growth and progression of tumors already formed.  This is especially relevant since many smokers use nicotine supplements to quit smoking.  The studies proposed in this application will elucidate the mechanisms by which nicotine induces cell proliferation, tumor growth and spread, as well as formation of new blood vessels.  These studies can be expected to lead to the development of novel agents to combat cancer.

mammalian respiratory system to the inhalation of ambient concentrations of oxidant air pollutants.
The focus of this renewal application will be on mechanisms of environmentally induced asthma in young
children, using the model of environmental allergic asthma in infant rhesus monkeys that we have developed
through support of this program. Using this model over the previous five years of funding, we have made a
number of startling discoveries regarding the effect of chronic ozone exposure on lung development and
growth during infancy, including: stunting of airway growth, postnatal loss of airway generations, impaired
establishment of the FGF-2 ternary signaling complex by basal cells, the failure of epithelial surfaces to
innervate, impaired central nervous control, enhancement of the allergic response, airway hyperreactivity,
disrupted alveolarization, and airway remodeling. The analytical framework in which all of the studies proposed
for this renewal will be conducted is the epithelial/mesenchymal trophic unit, whose cellular components
establish trophic interactions via an extracellular signaling complex modulated by the basement membrane
zone.
The overall hypothesis for this program is that environmental exposure to oxidant air pollutants promotes the
development of allergic asthma in the developing lungs of young children and exacerbates its severity by: (1)
disrupting the homeostasis within the epithelial/mesenchymal trophic unit and (2) fundamentally compromising
the establishment and differentiation of the trophic interactions that promote normal airway growth and
development. These changes result from the superimposition of continual cycles of acute injury, inflammation,
and repair on the immune response to allergen exposure.
This Project will focus on mucosal immunity within the epithelial/mesenchymal trophic unit, with the following
specific aims:
1) Determine how episodic ozone exposure in conjunction with sensitization to house dust mite (HDM)
allergen can initiate the asthma phenotype during postnatal development.
2) Determine how episodic ozone exposure in conjunction with sensitization to HDM allergen can contribute
to the progression of the asthma phenotype.
3) Determine how episodic ozone exposure in conjunction with sensitization to HDM allergen can result in
persistence of the asthma phenotype into early adulthood.

injury and the development of osteoarthritis (OA). A significant clinical association has been documented
between traumatic meniscal injury and OA, but the mechanism(s) behind how damage to the meniscus
either directly or indirectly induces pathogenesis are not known. Recently, we have determined that articular
chondrocyte loss of TGF-beta signaling induced by over-expression of the ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 leads to
an OA-like phenotype in the mouse. Furthermore, we have identified up-regulation of Smurf2 in human
articular cartilage shortly following meniscal trauma. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that Smurf2
up-regulation is the seminal event in the arthritic process the follows meniscal injury. Furthermore, based on
our findings that increased BMP signaling occurs in conjunction with inappropriate maturation of articular
chondrocytes during OA, we also hypothesize that reduction of BMP signaling via genetic or gene therapy
approaches will decelerate disease progression in murine OA induced by meniscal injury. To address these
central hypotheses, we propose to address the following 3 Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will comprehensively
characterize the tissue and molecular events leading to cartilage degeneration in a model of murine OA
induced by meniscal injury. In Aim 2, we will use genetic and gene therapy approaches to evaluate a
candidate therapeutic intervention in this murine OA model that are based on reduction of BMP signaling.
For these basic science aims, we will employ MRI and microCT imaging methods, histomorphometry and
molecular analyses to evaluate disease phenotype. Then, in Aim 3, a human clinical study will be executed
which will quantify articular cartilage structural changes following acute meniscal injury using a quantitative
MRI approach. Molecular changes will also be assessed in discard cartilage and meniscus tissue to further
evaluate the involvement of Smurf2 in the pathogenesis of OA disease following injury."," ",

Among these,
members of the TGF-beta superfamily are well known to play key roles. TGF-beta and related proteins also play
key roles in normal lung development, while TGF-beta itself plays an important role in the response to injury.
TGF-beta expression and signaling also contributes to pathobiology of some lung diseases and to carcinoma
development and progression. Consequently the mechanisms of TGF-beta signaling have been of great interest in
both normal development and in pathology. TGF-beta and related proteins signal through heteromeric, cell surface
complexes of two types of transmembrane serine-threonine kinase receptors, which in turn activate, through
phosphorylation, the Smads. Smad proteins act as intracellular effectors of TGF-beta signals that, following
activation and heteromerization, translocate into the nucleus where they elaborate the ligand-induced transcription
responses of many genes. The TGF-beta-induced Smad signaling pathway is now well accepted and its model of
activation and mechanism of action are well developed. Increasing evidence, however, points out that the TGF-beta
activation of the receptor complex also initiates other, non-Smad signaling pathways. Some of these observations
are now being recognize, but very little is known about these non-Smad signaling mechanisms, how they link to
receptors and what role they play inthe TGF-beta induced cellular response. Some of these parallel pathways may
directlyregulate Smad signaling,while others may effect unrelated responses. This research proposal works from
the hypothesis that these TGF-beta-induced non-Smad signaling pathways greatly contributeto the cellular
response to TGF-beta and related factors. We propose to initiatea research program aimed at defining several
TGF-beta-induced non-Smad signaling pathways, thereby specifically focusing on the activation of Erk MAP kinase,
p38 MAP kinase, JNK and RhoA signaling in response to TGF-beta. The four Aims of this proposal will study how
the activtion of these pathways is biochemically and mechanistically linked to the activation of the TGF-beta
receptors and how they affect the cellular response to TGF-beta at the level of Smad activation and gene
expression. Together, these studies should provide insight into the mechanisms of action of TGF-beta and related
factors in normal development and inpathobiology."," ",

1.	In our established clinical protocol, 03-DK-0132, The Expression of Connective Tissue Growth Factor and Other Mediators in the Pathogenesis of Chronic Allograft Nephropathy, and we have enrolled a total of 134 patients.  We found that serum and urine CTGF levels are elevated in kidney transplant recipients compared to healthy individuals and in this limited data set, urine levels correlate to biopsy pathology, with the highest in patients with CAN. The results of these studies were published in the Am Journal of Transplantation 2006.  We have an approved MTA and are currently analyzing a test set of samples with our collaborator Dr. Gregory Shultz.  This data set includes over 900 urine and serum samples, with associated transplant biopsies and clinical data.  Results will be entered into our database, Teleresults, and correlated to demographic, transplant, and other medical variables.
2.	To further investigate the mechanism of CTGF in renal fibrosis, we have developed a transgenic construct containing the CTGF gene under control of a proximal tubular epithelial cell specific promoter.  Inhibition of CTGF has not been successful utilizing siRNA or antibody approaches and the KO is congenitally lethal.  We are constructing a site directed CTGF KO within the kidney as well as a conditionally expressed KO.
3.	Mouse kidney transplants that develop CAN also have significant macrophage infiltration within the interstitium.  Associated with this infiltration is a marked upregulation of macrophage activation transcripts, and genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transformation.  In vitro mechanistic studies indicate that activated macrophages may stimulate expression of EMT markers on tubular epithelial cells when placed in co-culture, and that this is due to a soluble factor, that is not TGF-beta dependent.  These kidney allografts also have marked expression of peritubular capillary C4d expression indicating a component of antibody mediated injury that may be enhanced by macrophage infiltration.  We are examining the relationship between alloantibody, macrophage activation, and epithelial cell injury in this model to find 
4.	As the potency of immunosuppression has risen over the decade, so has graft loss due to BK polyomavirus nephropathy.  We have identified the transcriptional profile of BK PVN and determined that while it is remarkably similar to acute rejection, markers of T cell cytotoxicity are dramatically elevated out of proportion to rejection.  Moreover, more so than acute rejection which is tightly linked to CAN, PVN biopsies show transcriptional evidence of fibrogenesis.  We are the first group to report transcriptional events in PVN and the presence of a pro-fibrotic milieu is also novel. With collaboration with both NIH IC and extramural investigators, we are identifying whether the profibrotic impact of infection is related to the immune response to virus or to an intrinsic response of tubular epithelial cells infected by virus.
5.	Using our real time PCR low density array as a platform, we continue to investigate, at a molecular level, the gene transcript profile of fibrogenesis, as noted in #4.  We are exploring these molecules and other immune factors in transplant glomerulopathy, a pathologic entity associated with rapid rate of graft loss and high levels of proteinuria.
6.	Using an antibody microarray platform in collaboration with Dr. Srivastava at USUHS, we are analyzing the proteomic signature in both urine and blood in normal individuals, as well as in recipients with stable kidney transplant function and normal biopsies, as well as in those with acute cellular rejection, and chronic allograft nephropathy.  Our preliminary results indicate that urine samples may more closely indicated intrarenal injury and that CAN recipients demonstrate marked upregulation and downregulation of a numberof signaling pathways compared to both stable function and acute rejection samples.  We are further evaluating samples collected prior to the biopsy diagnosis to establish a time course of activity.  We are identifying several signaling pathways to target in in vitro studies and in the mouse transplant model.
7.	In order to investigate the role of the dopamine D5 receptor, we have now transplanted a total of 89 kidneys for our collaborators Dr. Pedro Jose and Dr. David Sibley, between mutant D5KO and WT mice.  These studies appear to indicate that there are non-renal mechanisms of blood pressure regulation, specifically mediated by this receptor.  Despite alterations in baseline blood pressures, there is no difference in histology.","831422",

stenosis is enormous and continues to escalate with the increased survival of these once fatal congenital
abnormalities and the burgeoning aging population. Valve replacement by tissue engineering presents an
attractive potential therapeutic, intervention for both children and adults. However, the ultimate success of
these strategies will be determined by the degree to which they can recapitulate the critical processes of
normal aortic and pulmonary valve ontogeny. We hypothesize semilunar valve development requires the
carefully orchestrated transformation of a genetically distinct subpopulation of endocardia! cells to
provide unique valvular interstitial cells (VICs) that remodel a defined extracellular matrix and
maintain valve homeostasis in response to degenerative stimuli. Using the genetic reagents developed
in our laboratory and the exceptional expertise and resources of the SysCode consortium, we propose to
develop a molecular blueprint of valve development and maturation required for successful tissue
engineering. Our strategy is to disrupt a discrete pathway at critical stages of valve morphogenesis to
expose essential homeostatic interactions. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Determine the major regulatory
pathways that are essential for initiation of valve formation in the outflow tract endocardial cushions
(EDC). Endocardial specific deletion of a floxed Alk3 allele will be used to perturb BMP signaling as a model
of attenuated epitheliahmesenchymal transformation (EMT) and NFATd null mice will be used as model of
accentuated EMT. Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM) and Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS) will be
employed to compare tissue specific gene and protein expression profiles. 2) Define the critical regulatory
pathways that characterize valve remodeling and homeostasis in late embryonic and postnatal
semilunar valve. A novel pro-valvar endocardial specific Cre will be used to delete a floxed Tie1 allele
which results in a hyperplastic valve phenotype. ApoE-/- mice will be used as a model of progressive aortic
valve stenosis. . Mice will be evaluated for alterations in valve leaflet thinning, progression of aortic
calcification. 3) Delineate the essential components of a synthetic matrix required to recapitulate valve
development in vitro. Based; on information obtained we will determine the key components required to
induce EMT and ECM remodeling an in vitro Hyaluronic Acid (HA) Hydrogel culture system. Effectiveness of
matrix manipulations will be assayed by a)the ability to induce transformation of endocardial cells in which
TGF¿ signaling has been attenuated by deletion of the Tgfbr2 receptor and b) the ability to recapitulate valve
formation via specification and transformation of FACS sorted ES cell derived endocardial cells.","545200",

DESCRIPTION:  Retrocorneal fibrous membrane (RCFM) occurs in various corneal diseases or after damage to the corneal endothelium. RCFM of Descemet's membrane is believed to represent an end-stage disease process of the corneal endothelium and can result in corneal opacity, fibrosis and subsequent blindness. The long-term goal of this project is to characterize the mechanism involved in the endothelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) observed in RCFM. During EMT, three major phenotypes are altered in corneal endothelial cells (CECs): cell proliferation is markedly stimulated; cell shape is changed and contact-inhibited phenotypes are lost; and fibrillar extracellular matrix is produced. During the current funding period, we demonstrated that FGF-2 is the direct mediator for EMT and that PI 3-kinase is a major signaling molecule for both mitogenic and morphogenetic pathways. PI 3-kinase is involved in Gl/S transition as it regulates the expression of Cdk4 and p27, while PI 3-kinase regulates reorganization of actin cytoskeleton.  Using a proteomic approach, we identified the protein factor released by inflammatory cells: the cytokine turned out to be interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Our pilot studies demonstrate two additional important results: 1) IL-1beta markedly induces FGF-2 synthesis; 2) FGF-2 greatly stimulates transcription of alpha1(I) collagen RNA, suggesting that transcription of alpha1(I) collagen RNA is the rate limiting step for type I collagen production. Our working hypothesis is that when cornea is injured, the infiltrating inflammatory cells release IL-1beta, which in turn greatly induces FGF-2. As a direct mediator of EMT, FGF-2 modulates type IV collagen-synthesizing polygonal CECs to type I collagen-synthesizing fibroblasts through the action of PI 3-kinase.  We will test the hypothesis using our in vitro model of EMT induced by FGF-2; 1) we will investigate the mechanism by which FGF-2 enhances synthesis of type I collagen leading to secretion of the molecule; 2) we will focus on the mechanism of p27 degradation, for the activity of p27 is mostly controlled by its concentration; 3) we will investigate how Rho, Rac and Cdc42, and their cross-talks modulate CECs to fibroblastic cells; 4) we will study the role of IL-1beta during EMT; 5) we will attempt to block EMT by antagonizing the specific target proteins (FGF-2, PI 3-kinase, p27 and IL-1beta); and 6) we will test whether metabolic inhibitors that block EMT in the in vitro study will also block RCFM formation in vivo. Thus, our understanding of the whole spectrum of EMT will lead us to clinical applications for blocking corneal fibrosis observed in corneal endothelium-Descemet's membrane.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung transplantation is the only definitive therapy for many forms of end stage lung disease. However, survival of the transplant recipient is limited by chronic rejection, known as obliterative bronchiolitis (OB). Rejection episodes are initiated by recipient T cells recognizing donor major histocompatibility complexes (MHC). However, we have reported the rejection response also involves specific immunity to a native protein, type V collagen [col(V)], and that immunity to col(V) is a major risk factor for the development of OB. Therefore, lung transplant rejection is a disease if both allo- and autoimmunity. Immune responses require lymphocyte migration from the blood stream to lymph nodes followed by emigration of activated lymphocytes to sites of inflammation/injury. However, the mechanism of anti-col(V) lymphocyte migration and emigration into and from mediastinal lymph nodes and BALT, respectively, are unknown. In addition, recent studies implicate a novel group of T cells (Th-17) able to induce autoimmune disease in many organs, including the lung. However, the role of Th-17 cells in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity that occurs during lung transplant rejection has not been characterized. Recognition of donor alloantigens occurs via two pathways, direct and indirect; and the two types of rejection, acute and chronic, have been attributed to the activity each pathway, respectively. The current paradigm of direct and indirect allorecognition is based on the ability of donor antigen presenting cells (known as passenger leukocytes) and recipient-derived antigen presenting cells (APCs), respectively, to activate recipient T cells. However, the role of passenger leukocytes and somatic cells in lung grafts to mediate acute rejection and OB is unknown. Furthermore, the requirement for these cells to induce Tregs specific for donor antigens and col(V) has not been reported. Utilizing a rat model of lung transplantation, the current proposal tests the hypothesis that alloimmune-induced autoimmunity to col(V) mediates lung transplant destruction by examining the following specific aims: Aim 1. To determine if the adhesion pathways utilized by col(V)-reactive lymphocytes for migration/emigration to mediastinal nodes and BALT are differentially regulated. Aim 2. To determine the contribution of humoral and Th-17 cellular immunity to the pathogenesis of anti-col(V)-mediated pathology. Aim 3. To determine the contribution of somatic cells and passenger leukocytes in the transplanted lung in development of Tregs and autoimmunity to col(V) during allograft rejection. This application will investigate the causes of lung transplant rejection which is the leading cause of death in lung transplant recipients. This application may also identify new areas that may allow for new treatments of this clinical problem.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is critically involved in the genesis and progression of human cancers and is considered as an attractive target for anti-cancer therapy. However, clinical success with anti-EGFR therapy remains limited in part due to our incomplete knowledge of the EGFR pathway. Accumulating evidences revealed a novel mode of EGFR signaling in which EGF ligand shuttles EGFR into the nucleus, leading to cyclin D1 gene activation. Patients with breast tumors that contain high nuclear EGFR survived poorly compared to those with no/low levels. However, the nature and pathological significance of this novel EGFR network remain largely unknown. We will test the hypothesis that nuclear EGFR functions as both a transcriptional regulator and a tyrosine kinase and that de-regulated nuclear EGFR pathway contributes to a more aggressive biology of human tumors. Preminary data indicate a novel nuclear interaction between EGFR and the oncogenic transcription factor, signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, STATS, leading to increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Aim 1 will characterize nuclear EGFR/STAT3 interaction and determine its role in iNOS gene regulation. Moreover, whether nuclear EGFR also functions as a tyrosine kinase remains unknown. Interestingly, preliminary results suggest that nuclear EGFR phosphorylates c-jun. In addition, we found that EGF activates expression of TWIST, a mediator for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)/metastasis and that TWIST gene promoter can be regulated by EGFR, c-jun and STATS. Aim 2 will thus determine the effect of EGFR/ c-jun/STAT3 interplay on TWIST gene activation and TWIST-mediated EMT/tumor progression. A role of nuclear EGFR in Taxol/5-Fu resistance is suggested by our preliminary data. Aim 3 will determine the significance and mechanisms for nuclear EGFR-mediated chemoresistance. This proposal is highly relevant to public health and its outcome will shed light into the nuclear EGFR signaling network in human cancers.

The laboratory is focused on a complex morphogenetic       process known as gastrulation, during which the mesoderm and endoderm germ layers are formed       and the body plan is established. Gastrulation begins with the formation of the primitive       streak (PS), a transient developmental structure that forms at the posterior terminus and       converts pluripotent epiblast stem cells into mesoderm and endoderm progenitors. We have found       that seven of the nineteen mammalian Wnt genes are expressed in the PS, suggesting that Wnts       may function there to regulate stem cell self-renewal or differentiation. Several pathways are       known to transduce Wnt signals, including the Wnt/bcatenin and Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PCP)       pathways. This project specifically addresses the role that the Wnt/bcatenin pathway plays in       gastrulation and stem cell development. Wnt2b is one of the seven Wnt genes expressed in the       PS. To examine its function there we generated a null allele and found that Wnt2b does not       have an essential role in embryogenesis. Interestingly, Wnt2b is co-expressed with other Wnt       genes in several stem cell niches in the embryo, including the early lung progenitors. To test       whether Wnt2b functions redundantly with the closely related Wnt2a, we collaborated with Ed       Morrisey at Penn to generate double mutants. Remarkably, we found that embryos lacking       Wnt2a/2b do not develop lungs, and do not express Nkx2.1, the earliest marker of lung       endodermal progenitors. In contrast, activation of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling       results in expansion of lung endoderm progenitors into the posterior gut. Our data reveal that       canonical Wnt2a/2b signaling is uniquely required for specification of lung endoderm       progenitors but not endoderm progenitors of other foregut derived tissues. This work is       currently under review. We have previously generated a transgenic reporter of Wnt/bcatenin       signals in vivo (the BATlacZ mouse) and shown that the pathway is highly active in the PS,       primarily functioning to transduce Wnt3a signals (Nakaya et al., 2005). By crossing the T-Cre       mouse (Perantoni et al., 2005), which expresses Cre recombinase specifically in the PS and       posterior mesoderm, with mice carrying conditional loss and gain of function alleles of       beta-catenin, we have shown that Ctnnb1 (which encodes beta-catenin) transduces Wnt3a signals       in the PS and is necessary for mesoderm formation and segmentation (Dunty et al., 2008). These       and other results suggest that Wnt3a and bcatenin are necessary for the specification or       maintenance of an embryonic mesodermal stem cell. Interestingly, constitutive activation of       bcatenin in the PSM inhibits progenitor maturation, suggesting that Wnt/bcatenin signaling       maintains PSM progenitor self-renewal by inhibiting their differentiation. How Wnt signaling       balances stem/progenitor cell renewal and differentiation during the homeostatic maintenance       of the embryonic mesoderm is poorly understood. Activation of the Wnt/bcatenin signaling       pathway stabilizes bcatenin, which interacts with members of the Lef/Tcf family of DNA-binding       factors to transcriptionally activate target genes. Thus a major goal of the laboratory is to       elucidate the target genes and transcriptional networks activated by Wnt3a during early       embryogenesis. We have generated genome-wide transcriptional profiles of wildtype (wt) and       Wnt3a-/- embryos and identified 150 differentially expressed genes including several       previously characterized direct Wnt/bcatenin target genes (Dunty et al., in prep). Remarkably,       over a third of these genes encode transcriptional regulators. We have performed a       comprehensive in situ hybridization screen to examine the expression of these putative target       genes in embryos and have identified several novel targets. These studies have led to the       demonstration that Mesogenin (Msgn), a mesoderm-specific bHLH transcription factor, is a       crucial mediator of Wnt3a/bcatenin signaling during mesoderm homeostasis. Molecular genetic       studies demonstrate that Msgn is a direct target gene of the Wnt3a/bcatenin pathway that       functions in a negative feedback loop to promote mesoderm maturation by suppressing Wnt3a.       Overexpression of Msgn in zebrafish embryos similarly represses Wnt3a, but also activates the       premature expression of somitic markers, suggesting that Msgn controls the commitment of       nascent PSM progenitors to the somitic lineage. Remarkably, Msgn also regulates the expression       of Snail, a transcriptional repressor necessary for the epithelial-mesenchymal transitions       that occur during mesodermal morphogenesis and segmentation. Thus, Msgn functions as a       critical activator of mesodermal maturation by blocking the renewal of mesodermal progenitors,       and promoting their morphological transition and commitment to the somitic lineage. Our       transcriptional profiing studies have also led to the identification of a novel       transcriptional corepressor, Ripply2, which is transcriptionally regulated by Wnt3a and       bcatenin during mesodermal segmentation (Biris et al., 2007), suggesting a potential mechanism       for the control of segmentation by Wnts (Dunty et al., 2008). By transcriptionally profiling       Wnt mutants that display deficits in stem cell populations in the early embryo, we have       identified a large number of new stem cell-associated Wnt target genes. Since gain of function       mutations in the Wnt pathway cause colorectal cancer in humans and gastrointestinal tumors in       mice, we screened our embryonic Wnt target genes for expression in the adult intestine and in       intestinal tumors. Remarkably, many of our genes are expressed in the stem cell compartment of       the GI tract, and are highly expressed in adenomas caused by Wnt gain of function mutations.       These results demonstrate that our Wnt target genes are expressed in unrelated embryonic and       adult stem cell compartments suggesting that their expression may be associated with       'stemness'. Although other groups have previously shown that the Zn finger transcription       factor Sp5 is an embryonic Wnt target, we have shown that Sp5 is highly expressed in adult       gastrointestinal tumors. Our preliminary functional analyses suggest that Sp5 is an important       effector of Wnt signaling during tumorigenesis. The loss of Sp5 in animal models of familial       adenomatous polyposis (FAP) caused by mutation in tumor suppressors in the Wnt/bcatenin       pathway led to the formation of fewer GI tumors. To test whether Sp5 is sufficient to cause       intestinal tumorigenesis independent of Wnt signaling, we are currently using the       well-characterized GI-specific Villin promoter to overexpress our target genes in the       intestinal epithelium of transgenic mice, specifically in the intestinal stem cell niche or       crypts. Another interesting stem cell-associated gene functioning downstream of Wnt3a is the       Tgf-beta family member Nodal. Nodal is known to regulate pluripotent stem cells in the early       embryo and has also been associated with melanoma agressiveness. Nodal was identified as a       putative downstream target gene of Wnt3a/bcatenin signaling in the early embryo and is       expressed in the adult intestinal crypt s [summary truncated at 7800 characters]","595901",

Intriguingly, analysis of BATlacZ transgenic mice       expressing a beta-catenin-transactivated lacZ reporter revealed that the reporter is strongly       expressed in the ureteric bud but not in surrounding metanephric mesenchyme (MM) or newly       formed nephronic tubules, raising the possibility that beta-catenin may act through a       TCF/LEF-independent mechanism to promote MET and tubule formation. To explore the mechanism,       isolated MMs were treated with a variety of small molecules that affect the Wnt/beta-catenin       pathway. An activator of Wnt signaling (WA), which stimulates TCF/LEF-dependent       transactivation without altering beta-catenin levels, could not induce MET. Three glycogen       synthase kinase-3beta inhibitors, including bromoindirubin-3-oxime (BIO), were able to       increase beta-catenin levels and induce MET. Proteasome inhibitor MG132 also increased       beta-catenin levels, but did not induce MET. Furthermore, short exposures to protein synthesis       inhibitor cycloheximide did not prevent BIO-induced tubule formation despite inhibition of TCF       activation. In human embryonic kidney-derived HEK293 cells, treatment with BIO, but not WA,       promoted tight junction formation, a beta-catenin-involved process often regarded as a       hallmark of epithelial transformation. GST pull-down studies found that BIO treatment       increased both TCF- and cadherin-binding forms of beta-catenin, while MG132 elevated only the       TCF-binding form. Expression of a mutated cadherin that disrupts normal beta-catenin/cadherin       complex formation prevented BIO-induced tight junction formation. Consistent with these       observations, neutralizing antibody against cadherin abrogated BIO-induced tubulogenesis in       cultured MMs. These data indicate that a beta-catenin interaction with cadherin plays an       essential role in MET and tubule formation during renal development. Human Wilms tumor is       formed in the embryonic progenitor metanephric mesenchyme, so a possible role for beta-catenin       in its pathogenesis would seem reasonable. Collaborative investigations of beta-catenin in rat       nephroblastomas, the rodent equivalent of the pediatric Wilms tumor, have revealed its nuclear       localization in the majority of tumors and at a similar frequency as reported for Wilms       tumors. This suggests that beta-catenin-dependent transcriptional activation is important in       nephroblastoma pathogenesis. Since nephroblastoma cells are inhibited in their ability to       undergo MET, it is possible that beta-catenin may function as the gatekeeper for proliferation       or differentiation in metanephric mesenchymal progenitors. If directed toward E-cadherin       binding, beta-catenin may mediate MET; whereas, it may induce proliferation if translocated to       the nucleus to activate Wnt target gene expression, which appears to be required for       tumorigenesis. We plan to further analyze the decision making that occurs in generating these       different binding forms of beta-catenin. We have also investigated the susceptibility of rat       to develop nephroblastomas. The Noble rat is exquistely sensitive to chemical induction of       these tumors, while the F344 rat is insensitive. When these animals are cross bred, they       develop a tumor incidence that is intermediate between the two and depending upon the       backcross the tumor incidence is changed in such a manner as to suggest the involvement of a       single autosomal locus with incomplete dominance. We are now beginning studies to identify       that genetic locus. Previous studies with another rat strain implicated the Wilms tumor       suppressor-1 gene (Wt1) in nephroblastoma pathogenesis. However, an examination of this gene       along with Wtx, another Wilms tumor associated gene, has revealed no mutations in these       tumors, suggesting the involvement of a novel locus in the Noble rat. Since the etiology of       Wilms tumor remains largely undefined, it is quite possible that we may be targeting an       important novel genetic event in this model. In addition to the involvement of the Wnt       signaling pathway in Wilms tumor development, we previously reported the constitutive       activation of STAT1 in human tumors. Constitutive STAT activation occurs in a variety of human       neoplasms. While investigating the possible dysregulation of STATs in Wilms tumors, we       discovered constitutive S727 phosphorylation of STAT1 in primary tumor tissues and       demonstrated its role in Wilms tumorigenesis. Since this neoplasm is a prototype for arrested       cellular differentiation in cancer, STAT1 signaling might also play an important role in the       developing kidney. To address this, we utilized explant cultures of metanephric mesenchyme       (MM), the progenitor of nephronic epithelia and putative tumor origin. Interferon-gamma       (IFNg), unlike differentiation-inducing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), caused STAT1, but       not STAT3, activation in MM. In functional opposition to LIF, which induces tubulogenesis in       MM, IFNg stimulated proliferation in MMs and inhibited nephron formation following induction.       Moreover, a protein kinase CK2 inhibitor, which blocks activation of STAT1, promotes       tubulogenesis in MMs. A peptide inhibitor that targets the STAT1 N-domain and specifically       disrupts STAT1-dependent transcription induces massive tubule formation in explanted MMs.       These findings indicate that STAT1 activation provides a critical regulatory signal in MM       specification, consistent with its role in Wilms tumorigenesis, and further suggest that       disruption of STAT1 activation may provide a novel target for Wilms tumor therapy. We are       currently evaluating the efficacy of using this novel STAT1 peptide as an anti-tumor agent in       vivo.","1041001",

Cytokines and growth factors promote smooth muscle cell proliferation, deposition of extracellular matrix and
microvascular remodeling that are prominent features of airway remodeling. New clinical evidence supports
an important role for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a growth factor that regulates vascular
permeability and angiogenesis, as a modulator of airway inflammation and AHR in asthma. We present
exciting new data demonstrating that VEGF enhances agonist-induced tracheal ring force generation. VEGF
also activates RhoA and Rac1 and induces formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ASM cells. In
light of these findings, we hypothesize that VEGF activates the Rho family GTPases in ASM cells,
leading to enhanced agonist-induced force generation through disruption of microtubules and
formation of ROS. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: Aim 1 will define the
in vivo effects of VEGF on Rho activation and agonist-induced force generation, using a murine model of
allergen-induced airway inflammation or transgenic overexpression of VEGF. The relative efficacy of VEGF
receptor-specific ligands to activate Rho, phosphorylate myosin light chain (MLC) and enhance agonist-
induced force will be characterized. We will also determine whether VEGF induces calcium sensitization in
ASM cells. Aim 2 will determine whether microtubule (MT)disruption mediates VEGF-induced
augmentation of force generation induced by agonists. We will determine whether MT disruption or
stabilization alters agonist-induced tracheal ring force generation and characterize the effect of VEGF on
phosphorylation of the MT-associated protein Tau. Finally, we will determine whether Rho activation is
necessary and/or sufficient for mediating VEGF effects on MT. Aim 3 will determine whether reactive
oxygen species are necessary and/or sufficient to mediate VEGF-induced augmentation of agonist-induced
force generation. We will determine the receptor specificity of VEGF-induced ROS generation and whether
inhibition of ROS formation abrogates the effects of VEGF on agonist-induced force. Agonist-induced force
generation in tracheal rings derived from gp91phox-deficient or superoxide dismutase transgenic mice will be
compared to the effects of antioxidants or enzyme inhibitors. Finally, we will determine whether expression
of VEGF modulates Rac activation in vivo and if Rac is necessary and/or sufficient for VEGF-induced ROS
and MLC phosphorylation in vitro. Elucidating mechanisms of VEGF-induced alterations in smooth muscle
cell force generation fits into the broader program of understanding the contribution of ASM cells to airway
remodeling in asthma, and may provide a basis for the development of anti-VEGF therapies aimed at
modulating the pathophysiological changes associated with asthma.","344098",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
Cardiovascular disease is the nation's leading cause of death, claiming a life every 33 seconds, 2600 lives each day, and nearly one million lives each year. For the majority of patients with any type of significantly advanced heart failure, the common, final clinical scenario is of a severely limited quality of life associated with a significant risk of death. The hypothesis behind the proposed projects is that stem cell therapy will benefit patients with varying degrees of heart failure. To date, the cummulative data from our studies and several others demonstrate that stem cell injections appear to be safe and possibly effective in at least some patients with heart failure. Our research consortium has conducted many studies (both pre-clinical and clinical) in this area of research and is currently enrolling patients in an FDA-approved Phase I clinical trial of transendocardial injections of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells for treatment of patients with advanced heart failure. In this application, we propose 2 potential protocols for the network. Protocol 1 allows us to continue our present trial with a Phase II trial that will also address an important question that remains unanswered: What is the ideal number of cells for transplant? (i.e.: Would 100,000,000 cells be more beneficial than the 30,000,000 we are currently using?) Protocol 2 focuses on the immediate postinfarct period and uses a specific type of stem cell, the Stro bright or mesenchymal precursor cell (MPC). All cells will be injected transendocardially and guided by electromechanical mapping into areas of viable myocardium. Safety of the cell delivery process will be assessed periprocedurely with Holter monitoring, and long-term safety will be assessed clinically for at least 3 years with imaging studies and catheter evaluations. Efficacy will be assessed primarily on the basis of imaging studies (echo, angio, MRI, SPECT, X-ray) and EKG, 24hr Holter monitoring, treadmill with MVO2, and lab work. We have now completed two pre-clinical studies using mesenchymal cell injections in canine models of chronic ischemia and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Both studies demonstrated that mesenchymal cells injected by the transendocardial route differentiated into smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, and resulted in increased vascularity and improved cardiac function. If proven safe and effective in FDA-approved clinical trials, these new therapies could extend the lives and improve the quality of life for almost 1 million people each year in the U.S. alone.

In diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), asthma, and chronic bronchitis, Submucosal glands expand in mass (hypertrophy) and/or abundance (hyperplasia), leading to excessive and abnormal mucus production. Genetic defects in serous cells of submucosal glands have also been hypothesized to be a contributing factor in lung disease in CF. In addition to playing a role in innate immunity of the airways, submucosal gland ducts have also recently been recognized as a potential protective niche for proximal airway stem cells. During the previous two funding cycles of this grant, our laboratory has focused on elucidating the mechanisms of submucosal gland development from proximal airway progenitors using human, ferret, and mouse model systems. The goal of these studies has been to better characterize the phenotype of glandular progenitor cells by understanding the transcriptional pathways that control the growth of glands in the airway during normal development. Since submucosal gland progenitors also appear to have the capacity to contribute to surface airway epithelial cell renewal, the biology of stem cells in both submucosal gland and surface epithelial compartments may be closely linked. We have previously demonstrated that a transcription factor, lymphoid enhancing factor-1 (Lef-1), is induced during the initial stages of airway progenitor/stem cell commitment to form submucosal glands and is absolutely required for glands to develop in the airway. More recently, we have begun to dissect the regulatory pathways that control transcriptional activation of the Lef-1 promoter in cell line models and glandular progenitors in transgenic mice. We have found that Wnt/(3-catenin pathways appear to play a critical role in regulating the Lef-1 promoter through a set of related HMG-box transcription factors (TCP and Sox). This proposal will use in vitro polarized airway models, ex vivo xenograft airway models, and genetic mouse models to study how Wnts, Noggin, and BMPs coordinate TCF/Sox regulation of the Lef-1 promoter during submucosal gland morphogenesis. Based on the inhibitory and enhancer functions of an identified Wnt-responsive element in the Lef-1 promoter, we hypothesize that Lef-1 regulation in glandular progenitors is controlled by both inhibitory (Sox and BMPs) and inductive (Wnt, TCF, and Noggin) signals. These hypotheses will be tested using viral vector systems and knockout mouse models capable of modulating the abundance of both extrinsic secreted factors and intrinsic transcription factors important for maintaining progenitor/stem cell phenotype and/or commitment to form glands. Lastly, this proposal will also attempt to evaluate whether TCF/Lef-1 pathways play a role in maintaining and/or mobilizing glandular duct stem cell niches for surface airway epithelial renewal following injury. Ultimately, this project will increase our understanding of stem cell phenotypes in the airway that have multipotent capacity for submucosal gland development and potentially also surface airway epithelial renewal. An increased understanding of submucosal gland morphogenesis may aid in the development of new therapeutic approaches to treat submucosal gland hyperplasia and hypertrophy in hypersecretory lung diseases. Furthermore, a greater knowledge of stem cell biology in the airway will greatly benefit the development genetic-based therapies for inhibited disease such as CF.","328944",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a competing continuation grant application that seeks to broaden current understanding of the biological role(s) of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating enzymes in myofibroblasts, key effector cells in tissue injury/repair processes. There is emerging evidence of an apoptosis-resistant phenotype of myofibroblasts, while alveolar epithelial cells undergo increased rates of apoptosis in lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This ""apoptosis paradox"" is likely perpetuated by paracrine and autocrine interactions between mesenchymal cells and epithelial cells. We have made the observation that the growth factor/morphogen, transforming growth factor-(1 (TGF-(1), generates extracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in contrast to intracellular ROS by classical mitogenic growth factors in lung myofibroblasts. The extracellular generation of H2O2 is mediated by the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) [NAD(P)+; NAD(P)H, reduced form] oxidase, Nox4, a homolog of the phagocytic oxidase, gp91phox (or Nox2). Activation of Nox4 is associated with the induction of myofibroblast differentiation and survival in response to TGF-(1. In vivo targeting of Nox4 activity by pharmacologic or RNAi approaches attenuates injury-provoked lung fibrosis in a murine model. Our hypothesis is that the activation of Nox4-dependent H2O2 production by TGF-(1 regulates myofibroblast proliferation and/or survival. Further, we hypothesize that blockade of Nox4 activity in vivo protects against fibrogenic responses to lung injury. Our specific aims are to: (1) determine mechanisms for Nox4 induction/activation by TGF-(1 in myofibroblasts and the role of Nox4/H2O2 in regulation of myofibroblast differentiation, proliferation and survival; (2) investigate the inherent heterogeneity of Nox4 expression/H2O2 production in IPF fibroblasts and determine relationship of Nox4 activity to specific myofibroblast phenotypes; (3) determine if inhibition/loss of NOX enzyme(s) in vivo protects against fibrosis in an experimental murine model of pulmonary fibrosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. The lung is exposed to various forms of injury. Abnormal repair responses can lead to the persistent activation of myofibroblasts that culminate in matrix remodeling and fibrosis (""scarring"") leading to organ failure and death.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has numerous etiologies and afflicts millions of individuals worldwide. Yet, there are no effective preventive agents or therapeutic approaches. This situation is due in large part to a lack of understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms that mediate the fibrogenic process. In the work proposed here, we have focused on two peptide factors that have been implicated by numerous researchers as central to the development of IPF. These factors are tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and transforming growth factor beta one (TGF-B1). Our previous work and preliminary data show that TNF-a  up-regulates the expression of TGF-B1 both in vitro and in vivo, but the basic mechanisms through which TNF-a influences TGF-B1 expression remain undefined. TNF-a has been considered by many to be a ""master cytokine"" that controls the expression of a number of biologically relevant molecules. In as much as TGF-B1 is considered to be a primary ""fibrogenic factor"", we have set forth the central hypothesis that TNF-a induces TGF-B1 production by transcriptional regulation through the MEK/ERK pathway in lung cells: and the pathway of fibrogenesis mediated by TNF-a through TGF-B1 can be interrupted by specific siRNAs that mediate the degradation of transcripts that code for TNF-a, MP-1- a key component of MEK/ERK phosphorylation, and TGF-B1. Specific Aim 1 will establish MEK/ERK transduction pathways from TNF-a to TGF-B1 and the transcriptional mechanisms of expression. Aim 2 will focus on other factors that could up-regulate TGF-B1 through this same pathway; and in Aim 3, we will learn if the epithelial and mesenchymal cells in vivo in the lung exhibit the same transduction and transcriptional pathways in health and disease. These studies will provide specific targets for potential therapeutic approaches through the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNA). Thus, in Aim 4, we will show that an siRNA we have designed blocks endogenous TNF-a gene expression. We propose to use this construct as well as an siRNA that degrades MP1 (a key protein in MEK/ERK phosphorylation), and finally an siRNA that will block TGF-B1 expression, and ultimately the development of IPF in our established animal models.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a crucial regulator of organ development during embryogenesis. Recently, we demonstrated that the Shh signaling is post-natally recapitulated upon ischemic injury of the adult skeletal muscle. We also found that the inhibition of the Shh pathway during skeletal muscle ischemia results in decreased angiogenic response. We also demonstrated that exogenous administration of Shh induces therapeutic angiogenesis in the ischemic muscle of old mice and that Shh intramyocardial gene transfer preserves heart function in myocardial ischemia, by enhancing neovascularization, reducing fibrosis, and increasing mobilization of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells. More recently, we have generated preliminary data showing that the Shh signaling pathway is also upregulated after mechanical and toxic injury of the skeletal muscle. In this setting, different cell types, including fibroblasts, macrophages, and satellite cells, respond to Shh activity. The aims of this proposal are: 1) to investigate the functional role of Shh on the activation of both angiogenesis- dependent and  independent mechanisms that are important for muscle regeneration; 2) to evaluate whether treatment with Shh improves regeneration in mouse models of skeletal muscle degeneration and dystrophy. The embryonic Shh signaling will be reconstituted by gene transfer of naked DNA encoding human Shh in the skeletal muscle of mice affected by ischemia, age- related muscle degeneration, or muscle dystrophy. We hypothesize that the activation of the Shh pathway will result in broad beneficial effects to muscle regeneration and repair, consistent with the role of this morphogen in embryogenesis, such as stimulation of angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, activation of muscle regulatory factors, and enhancement of the activity of muscle satellite cells.  
  
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use mouse models that are representative of important muscle diseases in humans. In particular, we will induce reconstitution of the embryonic Shh signaling in old mice (that have impaired muscular regenerative capacity, as observed in elderly individuals) and in mdx mice (a model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy). The results of this study might demonstrate that treatment with Shh may have considerable therapeutic potential in individuals with skeletal muscle diseases, by triggering expression of multiple trophic factors and engendering tissue repair in the adult.

Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) include multipotent cells with the ability to form mature bone organs upon in vivo transplantation. Hematopoiesis in these bone organs has been ascribed to the action of skeletal stem cells, which are capable of differentiating towards bone and hematopoiesis-supporting stroma. Yet, the creation of hematopoietic territories may be in part a natural consequence of the formation of a sufficiently mature and large bone microenvironment. We have studied the relationship between BMSC numbers and the extent of bone/hematopoiesis formation in vivo. Human BMSCs were transplanted along with hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate, utilizing a spectrum of dosages, into immunocompromised mice and the transplants were followed for up to 29 months. The extent of bone and hematopoiesis formation increased with increasing BMSC numbers; however, the relationship was sigmoid in character, and a threshold number of BMSCs was necessary for extensive bone formation or any hematopoiesis. Hematopoiesis only occurred in conjunction with extensive bone formation, and no hematopoiesis occurred where bone formation was poor. Consistent with our earlier studies of long-term BMSC transplantation, the transplants underwent a change in bone morphology (bone remodeling lead to generation of thick and even trabeculae) but not bone content (meaning, there was no bone overgrowth) after 8 weeks. Our results have provided evidence that the formation of both hematopoiesis and a mature bone organ is as much a consequence of a sufficiently high local density of bone marrow stromal cells as it is the product of skeletal stem cell action.

Skeletal stem cells (mesenchymal stem cells) in bone marrow are pericytes.

The anatomic localization of the clonogenic skeletal progenitors found in bone marrow stroma has long remained elusive.  Finding the identity of these cells is of interest not only to develop better strategies for their isolation, but also in order to determine how these cells establish the hematopoietic microenvironment in human bone marrow, and how they support the maintenance of the hematopoietic stem cell.  We found that MCAM/CD146-expressing, subendothelial cells (pericytes) in human bone marrow stroma are in fact the clonogenic subset of cells found in bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) populations.  CD146+ cells are capable of transferring the hematopoietic microenvironment to within a miniature bone/marrow organ created under the skin in immunocompromised mice, coincident with the establishment of identical subendothelial cells (pericytes).  Establishment of pericytes by stromal cells in developing heterotopic bone marrow in vivo occurs via specific, dynamic interactions with developing in-growing sinusoids. Subendothelial stromal cells residing on the sinusoidal wall are major producers of Angiopoietin-1 (a pivotal molecule of the hematopoietic stem cell niche involved in vascular remodeling).  This study has revealed the functional relationships between establishment of the hematopoietic microenvironment in vivo, the establishment of skeletal progenitors in bone marrow sinusoids, and angiogenesis.   

Characterization of craniofacial defects in mice with abnormal PTH/PTHrP receptor signaling.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) regulate calcium homeostasis, and PTHrP further regulates growth and development.  Ligand-induced signaling of PTH and PTHrP is mediated via a common G-protein coupled receptor, the PTH/PTHrP receptor.  A transgenic mouse carrying the constitutively active PTH/PTH-rP receptor (HKrk-H223R) under the control of the mouse bone and odontoblast specific alpha1(I) collagen promoter (Col1-caPPR) has been developed to demonstrate the complex actions of this mutant receptor in hard tissue formation.  We previously determined that there is exuberant abnormal bone formation in the long bones of these mice that is normalized with time due to the loss of skeletal stem cells.  We have now further characterized Col1-caPPR mice abnormalities in the craniofacial region as a function of development.  Col1-caPPR mice exhibited a delay in embryonic bone formation in the cranium.  After birth, expansion of a number of craniofacial bones including the maxilla and mandible was noted, with abnormal trabecular bone structure, reminiscent of the abnormality in the long bones.  Transgenic mice also exhibited a delay in tooth eruption.  Transgenic teeth were noted for an expansion of the pulpal tissue and a highly disorganized odontoblastic layer that was unable to form tubular dentin.  Finally, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) exhibited a completely disorganized structure, with hypertrophic cartilage that is normal present, being almost completely absent, and replaced by a dense fibroblastic tissue.  These abnormalities lead to a compete disfiguration of the TMJ by 4 months of age.  These findings suggest that the Col1-caPPR mouse is a useful model for characterization of the downstream effects of the constitutively active receptor during development and growth, and as a model for development of treatments of human diseases with similar characteristics.

Pre-clinical studies on iron oxide nanoparticle-labeled bone marrow stromal cells.

There is increasing interest in using exogenous labels such as bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) or dextran coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) to label cell populations to identify transplanted cells and monitor their migration by fluorescent microscopy or in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, direct transplantation of cells into target tissue can result in >80% cell death due to trauma or apoptosis. Bystander uptake of labeled cells by activated macrophages can confound the interpretation of the results. We investigated the frequency of BrdU or SPION uptake by activated macrophages using a Boyden chamber model of inflammation.  SPION labeled bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or HeLa cells, and mouse fibroblasts with BrdU were mixed in various ratios in Matrigel, in the upper chamber and incubated for up to 96 hours. FACS analysis of activated macrophages from the lower chamber using anti-CD68, anti-dextran antibodies revealed from 10 to 20% dextran or up to 10% BrdU positive activated macrophages after 96 hours of incubation. Transfer of iron to activated macrophages was < 10% of the total iron load in labeled cells.  The uptake of BrdU and SPION was dependent on the density of labeled cells to inflammatory cells and microenvironmental conditions.  Direct implantation of BrdU labeled cells into target tissue can result in uptake of label by activated macrophages, however, care should be taken to validate BrdU labeled cells by staining for bystander cell markers and microscopy.  The minimal uptake of SPION by activated macrophages would suggest that the observed signal changes on cellular MRI originate primarily from the implanted cells. 

Human embryonic stem cells

We continue to gain expertise in routinely growing HSF6 cells. These cells have been cultured in a number of different ways to induce their differentiation into mesoderm and into osteogenic tissues. Such cells have been transplanted in vivo using a number of different scaffolds to determine the efficacy of the differentiation conditions that have been utilized.","1822731",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Krabbe's disease is a life threatening, inherited glycogen storage disease resulting from mutations in the enzyme galactocerebrosidase (GALC). The only available therapy is heterologous bone marrow transplantation during the earliest months of life to produce the active form of GALC through out the body. Bone marrow transplantation is complicated by graft versus host disease, a severe immunological disorder characterized by engrafted cytotoxic T lymphocytes destruction of host tissues including the skin epithelium, intestinal mucosa, and kidneys. The complications of GVHD extend hospitalizations, increase medical costs, and have a high degree of associated morbidity and mortality. If the clinical diagnosis of Krabbe's disease is made later than the first few months, there is no effective treatment option for patients, as bone marrow transplant is no longer effective. Our Preliminary data indicates that GALC is expressed not only by hematopoietic stem cells but also by adipose derived stem cells. Based on these important observations, we propose to test the following overarching hypothesis: That adipose derived stem cells (ASC) have the potential to serve as a cell therapeutic expressing GALC for Krabbe's disease without the complicating destructive consequences of hematopoietic stem cell therapy. This proposal constitutes the initial proof of concept step in the translational and regenerative medical strategy outlined below. The murine studies are the first step in this process. Eventually, the nonhuman primate model will allow the analysis of our novel therapeutic interventions by permitting multiple biopsies, MRI analysis of animals and unique avenues, such as the ability to perform both cognitive and behavioral testing that cannot be done in lower order animal models. Additionally, the analysis of therapies in nonhuman primates permits the testing to be performed in a manner nearly identical to a human clinical trial. Our investigations are directed towards the only available nonhuman primate model of a human genetic disease, and will provide essential information that cannot be ethically obtained in a human clinical setting, and are of direct importance for the treatment of human fetuses and infants compromised by this devastating disease.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tumor metastasis is responsible for most treatment failures in breast cancer patients. In cancers of epithelial origin, loss of epithelial cell polarity and transformation into a migratory phenotype are key steps in invasion of cancer cells. Intravasation of cancer cells appears to be dependent upon epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated chemotaxis. Chemotaxis and invasion depends upon dynamic adhesion to extracellular matrix and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. Phosphoinositide signaling plays a key role in these processes, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. Type Igamma phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIPKIgamma) synthesizes phosphatidylinositol-4,5- bisphosphate (PIP2) in a temporal and spatial fashion within cells. Hypothesis: PIPKIgamma isoforms, via their expression, targeting, and regulation by EGF-stimulation, generate the messenger PIP2, which modulate the spatial and temporal assembly of focal adhesions and vesicular trafficking that regulates chemotaxis. The role of PIPKIgamma in regulating migration is key in the metastasis of tumors. Specific Aims: (1) The mechanistic role of PIPKIgamma in growth factor-stimulated directional migration and invasion will be investigated. EGF signaling mechanisms leading to phosphorylation of PIPKIgamma will be characterized as will the role of PIP2 production in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of PIPKIgamma and other proteins at focal adhesions. The underlying mechanism for PIPKgamma participation in EGF- stimulated chemotaxis and invasion will be explored, with an emphasis on the dynamic assembly of focal adhesions (FA) and vesicular trafficking. GFP/RFP-focal adhesion proteins will be used to define the role of PIPKIgamma in focal adhesions dynamics in EGF-stimulated cells. (2) Two new alternatively spliced PIPKIgamma isoforms that express unique C-terminal extensions will be characterized. PIPKIgamma splice variants interacting partners, intracellular targeting, and regulation will be defined. The roles played by these PIPKIgamma isoforms in cell migration will be investigated. (3) The role of PIPKIgamma splice isoforms in breast cancer intravasation and metastasis will be defined using a mouse model. (4) Changes in PIPKIgamma content and isoform expression in breast tumors will be studied using a large and well characterized breast tumor tissue microarray. We will investigate changes in PIPKIgamma expression levels in breast tumors and correlate this with other signaling molecules and biomarkers and with patient outcomes. This Aim will be the beginning of a long-term study to relate changes in PIPKIgamma expression with tumors of epithelial origin. This approach may yield important information, which will help to define the underlying mechanisms for our cell and molecular biology studies. In addition, our mechanistic studies will be translated into a greater understanding of breast cancer cell invasiveness.

Although its etiology is unknown, it is generally considered to arise from
androgen insensitivity. In 1997, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released reports documenting
an increase of almost 100% in hypospadias cases in the US from 1968 to 1993. It was suggested that environmental
contamination by endocrine disrupting agents might have contributed to this outbreak. In spite of its high
prevalence, mutations in androgen receptor (AR) or 5D-reductase have been found in less than 2% of the
hypospadias patient population, suggesting that multiple targets in the pathways of androgen signaling or
metabolism contribute to hypospadias. Surgical repair is the only treatment for hypospadias. Lack of an animal
model for hypospadias has limited our efforts to identify the pathogenesis of the disease, as well as development of
new therapies. In this application, we will investigate our discovery that the FK506-binding rjrotein, FKBP52, is
involved in the etiology of hypospadias. FKBP52 is also known as a steroid receptor associated-tetratricorjeptide
repeat domain protein (SRA-TPR) based on its ability to enter into heterocomplexes with steroid receptors via a
direct interaction with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). FKBP52 is one of several SRA-TPRs and is found in the AR
complex, as well as in progesterone receptor (PR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) complexes. In the GR system,
FKBP52 is known to increase the binding affinity for hormone, while FKBP51 (a closely-related SRA-TPR) serves
to attenuate (but not abolish) this function. In an effort to study the role of FKBP52 in vivo, we generated
FKBP52-deficient mice. Strikingly, FKBP52-deficientmales give rise to severe hypospadias with 100% penetrance.
Our initial morphological and histological characterization at both embryonic and adult stages revealed an essential
role of FKBP52 in androgen-mediated male genital development.Accordingly,this proposal will test the hypothesis
that FKBP52 is a key regulator of ligand-induced androgen receptor action and is critical to male urethral and genital
development. We will test this hypothesis in the following ways: 1)we will determine the developmental
mechanism of ventral urethral epithelium closure and male genital development; 2) we will determine the role of
FKBP52 in androgen receptor signaling at both the cellular and molecular level; 3) we will study the contribution of
FKBP51 to AR function and the development of hypospadias using mouse genetic tools.","255352",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objectives are to determine the role played by connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in promoting pancreatic fibrosis, which is a common feature of chronic pancreatitis. CTGF stimulates vital biological processes such as chondrogenesis, angiogenesis and matrigenesis via its regulation of cell proliferation, migration, transdifferentiation and production of extracellular matrix molecules. CTGF knockout mice exhibit lethal angiogenic and skeletal defects, while subcutaneous injection of CTGF causes dermal fibrosis. CTGF is over-expressed in many fibrotic lesions and acts downstream of transforming growth factor- beta (TGF-beta) in driving fibrosis. During pancreatitis, CTGF is over-expressed by several cell types and acts via autocrine and paracrine pathways to regulate the function of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs), the principal fibrogenic cell type in the pancreas. CTGF thus holds promise as a new therapeutic target in strategies designed to prevent or reverse pancreatic fibrosis. Our hypothesis is that CTGF production in PSC is stimulated by alcohol and that CTGF drives pro-fibrogenic and anti-apoptotic pathways in PSC through its binding and activation of integrin alpha5beta1 (a5b1), a novel CTGF receptor. The Specific Aims to test this hypothesis are 1. To determine the effect of ethanol and its metabolites on the production of CTGF in PSC; these studies will assess the effect of ethanol, acetaldehyde or fatty acid ethyl esters on CTGF production, the involvement of oxidant stress and TGF-beta, and the role of CTGF in autocrine regulation of PSC function; and 2. To determine the responses of PSC to CTGF and the role of integrin a5b1; these studies will address the expression, regulation, and activation of integrin a5b1 in PSC, will assess the role of integrin a5b1 in mediating pro-fibrogenic and anti-apoptotic signaling in PSC by CTGF, and will assess the role of CTGF in promoting fibrogenesis in vivo when administered against a background of acute pancreatitis in mice. The relevance of these studies to public health is that they will identify the mechanisms by which CTGF regulates PSC function and pancreatic fibrosis, and will thus lead to new treatment modalities.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary objective of this project is to define the role of ROBO2 deficiency in the pathogenesis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and reflux nephropathy using a reflux mouse model with a conditional Robo2 knockout allele. VUR is one of the commonest genetic disorders found in children, with an incidence of about 1:100. It is characterized by reflux of urine from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys and leads to scarring of the kidney cortex. Patients with VUR may present later in life with reflux nephropathy, a condition characterized by proteinuria, hypertension and focal glomerulosclerosis, which accounts for about 10% of cases of end-stage renal failure. Despite the high incidence of VUR in the pediatric population, the molecular basis of VUR and reflux nephropathy remains unknown. ROBO2 is a transmembrane protein for SLIT ligand that controls axon elongation and arborization. We have shown that ROBO2 is also involved in urinary tract development and is mutated in a subset of patients with VUR. We have generated and studied a conditional Robo2 knockout mouse model, which exhibits striking urinary tract abnormalities closely resembling those in human VUR. We also found that Robo2 is expressed in developing mouse glomeruli in a pattern that suggests a location in podocytes. In addition, Robo2 deficient mice exhibit low nephron number and post-injury proteinuria as well as abnormal ureteric branching and defective elongation of the ureters. Thus, our studies have provided strong evidence for the involvement of ROBO2 mutations in human VUR and provided us with a viable reflux mouse model to further investigate the role of Robo deficiency in the etiology of VUR and determine if loss of glomerular Robo2 confers susceptibility to reflux nephropathy. To examine potentially unique pathogenic mechanisms of VUR and reflux nephropathy, we propose first to characterize the reflux and reflux nephropathy phenotype in Robo2 deficient mice and to determine if Robo2 deletion leads to abnormal branching morphogenesis and low nephron endowment, which could confer risk of reflux nephropathy. Second, we propose to investigate the normal localization of Robo2 during glomerulogenesis and the structural and functional effects of Robo2 deletion in developing podocytes and in mature kidney. This will test the hypothesis that a primary abnormality of ROBO2 in the podocyte may render the kidney susceptible to injury in the face of VUR or obstruction. Lastly, given the abnormal ureteric branching and ureter elongation defects in Robo2 deficient mice and substantial actions of Robo/Slit signaling in neural development, we will examine if Robo2 controls ureteral structure and function and urinary tract innervation. In sum, these experiments will rigorously define the role of ROBO2 in the pathogenesis of VUR and reflux nephropathy. They will yield considerable mechanistic insights in vivo and ex vivo on the role of Robo in normal and abnormal developmental processes of the kidney and urinary tract. Results from these studies will provide new knowledge of disease mechanisms underlying developmental antecedents of VUR, which may assist us to predict who is at risk of reflux nephropathy and identify novel therapeutic strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a common condition in childhood that causes substantial morbidity from recurrent urinary infection and scarring of the kidneys. A significant proportion of patients with VUR will develop progressive kidney damage leading to reflux nephropathy and end-stage kidney failure. Understanding the underlying pathogenic mechanism of VUR and reflux nephropathy will provide novel approaches to detect patients at risk and identify novel therapeutic strategies.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Applicant:  Dr. Hoang, the candidate, is currently a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the University of California, Irvine. As evident from his biography, the candidate has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to a career in academic medicine. To this end, he would like to continue his research training in a mentored environment with the goal of becoming an independent investigator in musculoskeletal oncology.   
  
Environment:  The candidate is jointly mentored by several nationally and internationally recognized experts in Wnt signaling in human cancer and the genetics of osteosarcoma. The University of California, Irvine is a collegial environment with a tradition of nurturing career development of young clinician scientists.   
  
Research:  Osteosarcoma (OS) remains a pediatric bone cancer with substantial mortality due to a high metastatic rate. Although Wnt signaling is activated in several human malignancies, its role in the pathobiology of OS progression is largely unknown. Our preliminary work suggested that secreted Wnt inhibitors modulate the following pro-invasive pathways in OS:  (1) Transcriptional repressors Slug and Twist, (2) MMP-2 and 9, and (3) the hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met. Blocking receptor-mediated Wnt signaling by a dominant negative receptor or by the secreted inhibitor Dkk-3 dramatically decreases the invasive potential and motility of OS cells. These findings lead us to propose the following specific aims:  1) To examine whether secreted Wnt inhibitors can decrease invasive capacity of OS cells by suppressing E-cadherin transcriptional repressors; 2) To test the hypothesis that secreted Wnt inhibitors decrease OS invasiveness by suppressing MMP-2 and 9 or by regulating Met-dependent activity; 3) To determine whether overexpression of Wnt inhibitors will reduce lung metastasis in vivo in a tail-vein injection nude mouse model. These studies will bridge a gap in our knowledge on the role of secreted Wnt inhibitors in the biology of OS. Lessons learned from this investigation may be applicable to a wider range of human sarcomas and serves as a basis for future studies by the applicant as an independent investigator in musculoskeletal oncology.

We speculated that this kinase may play a crucial role in the regenerative process triggered by STZ. To examine this possibility, we injected STZ in age-matched and sex-matched Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4R24C/R24C (Cdk4R/R) mice. Less than two-month old mice were used in this experiment since at that age both Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4R/R strains of mice exhibit similar islet mass and blood glucose level, which allows analysis of the effects of STZ more accurately. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with STZ and monitored by analyses of blood glucose levels for evidence of hyperglycemia. Within 48 hours of STZ injection, all of the control Cdk4+/+ littermates developed hyperglycemia which persisted until either death or the need to sacrifice the mice due to poor health Dramatically and in contrast, none of the Cdk4R/R mice developed severe hyperglycemia or diabetes during the entire 14-day observation period. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that at the beginning of STZ treatment both Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4R/R mice have comparable islet mass. As early as 12 hours into STZ treatment islets from both the Cdk4R/R and Cdk4+/+ mice showed evidence of islet atrophy. By 48 hours after STZ treatment, majority of islets from Cdk4+/+ mice show evidence of extensive atrophy with very few easily detectable islets. In contrast, islets from Cdk4R/R mice appear to maintain their islet mass and by 24-48 hours majority of the islets from Cdk4R/R mice showed close to normal architecture and islet mass. During the period of 24-48 hours of STZ treatment we see evidence of a dramatic repopulation of the islet architecture and more significantly an increase in insulin immunofluorescence suggesting that the Cdk4R/R mice have a close to normal beta-cell repertoire. Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of beta-cells to undergo self-duplication, and thus we examined if this mechanism was responsible for the observed recovery of beta-cell mass in Cdk4R24C/R24C mice in response to STZ. To this end, we injected the DNA-analog BrDU into Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4R/R mice and harvested their pancreas 6-hours after BrDU administration. Similar numbers of BrDU-labeled cells were observed in untreated Cdk4R/R islets compared to untreated Cdk4+/+ islets indicative of a similar -cell proliferation rate in these mice at the beginning of the experiment. In contrast, to the severely reduced to non-existent BrDU-labeled cells in islets from 48-hour STZ treated Cdk4+/+ mice, we observed a significant increase in BrDU-labeled cells in islets from 48-hour STZ treated Cdk4R/R mice. These results elucidate that increased beta-cell proliferation leads to efficient reconstitution of beta-cell mass in Cdk4R/R islets in response to a STZ. 

There is much debate as to the post-natal origins of beta-cells and the mechanisms that lead to reconstitution of beta-cell mass.  It has been reported that (1) beta-cells turn over rather slowly since they have a long-lifespan and (2) that replication of pre-existing beta-cells is the primary mechanism that repopulates the beta-cell compartment. While beta-cell replication appears to be a primary mechanism responsible for the increase in beta-cell mass there is considerable evidence in favor of the contribution of the pancreatic ductal epithelium in generation of new beta cells via a process termed as neogenesis. The STZ model, considering the beta-cell specificity of STZ, is suitable to study the dynamics of beta-cell proliferation and the role of pre-existing beta-cells in the regenerative process. However, since majority of beta-cells are believed to be restricted to the endocrine islet compartment, the STZ model is for the most part limiting to the examination of the involvement of the ductal epithelium in pancreatic regeneration, including to study beta-cell neogenesis. To circumvent this bias, we used a distinct model of regeneration, partial pancreatectomy (PX), where the processes of beta-cell replication within the islets and neogenesis within the islets and in the surrounding pancreatic ductal epithelium can be analyzed. PX, either partial, sub-total and total, has been widely used to study pancreatic regeneration and the degree of PX determines the extent of glucose intolerance, onset of diabetes and the potential reconstitution of pancreatic mass. Here we performed a 70% PX on the two-month old sex-matched Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4R/R mice and evaluated their pancreas regenerative potential. Consistent with prior publications we did not observe glucose intolerance in either the Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4R/R mice after 70% PX. At the time of PX, the beta-cell mass in Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4R/R mice is comparable and five days (5d) after PX we also did not observe a substantial change in the overall beta-cell mass in either the Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4R/R mice . However, beta-cell mass was significantly increased in the Cdk4R/R mice, compared to that observed in Cdk4+/+ mice, 14d after PX. These observations indicate that inheritance of an activated Cdk4R24C kinase leads to enhanced beta-cell regeneration. No significant difference in beta-cell proliferation, as assayed by quantifying BrDU positive and Insulin Positive cells (BrDU+:Ins+), was observed in Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4R/R pancreas before and 1d after PX. At 2d post-PX we observed an increase in beta-cell proliferation in both the Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4R/R mice, although the degree of beta-cell proliferation between the two groups of mice were not significant. However, at d14 post-PX, a significant increase in beta-cell proliferation was seen in Cdk4R/R pancreas. In contrast the extent of beta-cell proliferation in Cdk4+/+ pancreas at 14d post-PX was similar to that seen at 2D post-PX. Taken together these observations indicate that in the Cdk4+/+ mice compensatory beta-cell proliferation reaches maximal potential by 2d post-PX, in contrast to the beta-cell proliferation in Cdk4R/R mice that continues until 14d post-PX. The contribution of neogenesis, via regeneration in the pancreatic ductal epithelium, is presently being evaluated.","384252",

death among American women. In an attempt to find the reasons for this increase in incidence, genetic,
environmental and dietary factors are being studied. The NF-KB family of dimeric transcription factors, which
controls genes critical for neoplastic transformation, cell proliferation and survival, consists of five members:
3 with transactivation domains (c-Rel, RelA, RelB), and 2 without (p50 and p52), which promote stronger
binding. NF-KB factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm in inactive complexes in most cells. Collaborative
studies by members of the Program Project demonstrated constitutive aberrant activation of c-Rel, RelA or
p50 NF-KB subunits in -90% of primary human breast cancers, and that exposure to polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs), such as 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) or benzo(a)pyrene, up-regulated
NF-KB in breast cancer. This led us to the central hypothesis in the original application that carcinogens can
constitutively activate NF-KB, which will promote transformation. In collaboration with Projects 1 and 2, we
have more recently shown that NF-KB complexes, which are induced by PAH exposure, play key roles in
promoting an invasive phenotype of breast cancer via epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). (1) PAH
exposure of mice activated multiple NF-KB complexes, the IKKe/i kinase and an invasive phenotype of mammary
tumors; (2) PAH exposure of c-Rel-driven breast cancer cells further activated NF-KB, which was required for an
invasive phenotype; (3) the c-Rel subunit can play a causal role in mammary tumorigenesis and cooperated
with protein kinase CK2 to induce the AhR and Slug, a master regulator of EMT; (4) a novel de novo RelB
synthesis pathway was identified, which promoted EMT via induction of Bcl-2; (5) RelB was induced by
DMBA or c-Rel and expressed in human breast cancer specimens. Of note, green tea and its polyphenol
epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) reduced invasive phenotype of DMBA-induced mammary tumors and
breast cancer cells. EGCG slowed proliferation of Her-2/neu breast cancer cell lines resistant to
trastuzumab, suggesting translational applications of green tea polyphenols. Thus, environmental
carcinogens are known to induce genetic as well as epigenetic events in mammary tissue. In this revised
renewal application, we propose to test the hypothesis that these perturbations induce or enhance the
activity of multiple NF-KB complexes thereby promoting a more invasive phenotype of breast cancer: thus
inhibition of these pathways will revert the process of EMT. Three aims are proposed: (1) elucidate the roles
of c-Rel and RelB NF-KB in promoting carcinogenesis; (2) determine the function of IKKe/i in carcinogenesis,
and the mechanism of IKKs/i promoter activation; (3) perform pre-clinical in vivo testing of the ability of green
tea polyphenols to reduce Her-2/neu-mediated transformation. These studies will provide important
information on the mechanisms of activation of aberrant expression of NF-KB factors by environmental
carcinogens, and characterize their roles in promoting invasive breast cancer. Green tea polyphenols are
potential inhibitors of breast cancer that can readily be translated to the clinic for combinatorial therapies."," ",

In the United States the prevalence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has reached epidemic proportions
with over 19 million adults being affected. The rates of ESRD among the elderly are disproportionably high.
Consequently, as life expectancy increases and the baby-boom generation reaches retirement age, the
already heavy burden imposed by ESRD on the United States health care system is set to increase
dramatically. The main cause of ESRD is chronic renal failure (CRF) driven by risk factors such as anemia,
diabetic hyperglycemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, air pollution,
atherosclerosis, repeated episodes of acute renal failure (ARF) and sleep apnea. All the risk factors
associated with CRF produce inappropriately low oxygen tensions within the kidney. This has lead to
hyperbaric oxygenation being used as a treatment for kidney failure and the contention that ¿chronic
hypoxia is a common pathway to end-stage renal failure¿. Numerous studies have demonstrated that
hypoxic conditions within the kidney produce CRF by inducing a sustained inflammatory attack mediated by
resident and infiltrating macrophages. Indispensable to the role of macrophages in causing CRF is
activation of their ability to bind renal tissue and generate pro-inflammatory cytokines. It was thought that
such activation resulted exclusively from macrophages responding to cytokines released from ischemic
renal endothelium. However, we have demonstrated that cells of the macrophage lineage also become
activated independent of the hypoxic response of endothelial cells. We found that this independent
mechanism involves macrophage precursors directly sensing hypoxia and responding by transcriptional
induction of the genes that encode the ¿2-integrin family of adhesion molecules. Other groups have shown
that resident macrophages also respond directly to hypoxia by enhanced synthesis of the cytokines TNF-a
and IL-6. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that transcriptional activation of the ¿2-integrin, TNF-a
and IL-6 genes in macrophages maintains the long-term inflammation by which hypoxia produces CRF. We
propose to test this hypothesis by accomplishing three specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, genomic
fingerprinting and homologous recombination will be used in the Identification of Cis-Acting Gene Elements
that Mediate Macrophage Activation in Response to Hypoxia. In Specific Aim 2 molecular cloning,
electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation will be used in the Identification of
Novel Trans-Acting Gene Control Factors that Mediate Macrophage Activation in Response to Hypoxia.
Finally, in Specific Aim 3 small interfering RNA and/or constitutive expression vectors will be tested in vitro,
ex vivo and in vivo to determine the efficacy of Protection Against Renal Failure by Modulating Trans-Acting
Macrophage Hypoxia-Response Factors. In this way we expect to provide proof-of-principal for new
therapeutic regimens that reduce the ability of hypoxia to cause CRF.","87750",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focuses on the potential role of reduced FGF10 signaling in the setting of ethanol (EtOH) impaired liver regeneration. FgflO, expressed in the embryonic foregut mesoderm, normally interacts with the adjacent endoderm through Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 2 1Mb (FGFR2b). Absence of signaling through FGFR2b results in atresias of numerous gastrointestinal tract structures. We have preliminary evidence showing that FGF10 activates canonical WNT signaling in the developing liver through FGFR2b. Our studies indicate that Fgf 10 is expressed by activated hepatic stellate cells, which play a key role in liver fibrogenesis, and that Fgfr2b is expressed by progenitor cells, hepatoblasts prenatally and oval cells postnatally. Consistent with the observation that FGFR2b signaling is activated during liver regeneration, we have evidence that Fgf 10 expression, which is upregulated after partial hepatectomy, is reduced in the setting of ethanol-induced impaired liver regeneration. We hypothesize that ethanol suppresses signaling through the FGF10/FGFR2b, thus, impairing progenitor cell proliferation. We thus propose the following  
specific aims: (1) To determine the role of FGF10 signaling via FGFR2b during liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy (PH) in the absence or presence of EtOH in transgenic mice. Liver-specific induced overexpression of the dominant negative soluble FGFR2b isoform or of Fgf 10 in the setting of EtOH impaired liver regeneration following PH will be performed for loss-of-function or gain-of-function analyses, respectively. (2) To determine the identity and role of Fgf 10-expressing cells in hepatogenesis and EtOHimpaired liver regeneration. Cells expressing Fgf 10 from transgenic embryo livers and PH livers exposed to EtOH will be sorted by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and characterized by real-time PCR. (3) To determine the identity of cells undergoing FGF10-mediated canonical WNT activation. Cells with activated canonical WNT signaling will be sorted by FACS. Loss and gain-of function analyses for FgflO will be performed to determine relative levels of canonical WNT activiation. Alcohol impairs the liver's ability to repair and regenerate itself. This contributes to the development of liver cirrhosis. We postulate that the mechanism by which alcohol impairs liver regeneration may be due to impaired signaling through the FGF10/FGFR2b pathway we show normally promotes liver regeneration.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
The applicant is a member of Dr. Joel Habener's laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Habener has been a leader in the fields of diabetes and endocrinology for over 30 years and has a history of training candidates to be successful independent researchers. Likewise, Massachusetts General Hospital is vibrant and supportive research institution that actively strives to foster the development of academic scientists. My career goal is to complete my training under Dr. Habener's supervision for the next 2-3 years, and then transition to a position as an independent scientist at an academic research and teaching institution. I would benefit from additional training from Dr. Habener so that I may learn methodologies and techniques to manipulate pancreatic endocrine function in vivo to compliment my current in vitro skills. I believe that it is essential that I develop the ability to function effectively in both cell culture and animal models so that I may properly address questions relevant to the management and cure of diabetes mellitus.  
Loss of beta cell mass through apoptosis is a significant event in the onset and progression of diabetes. Identifying ways to attenuate apoptosis and promote cell survival could provide significant benefit to those afflicted with this disease. I have recently identified the expression of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor Slug in pancreatic beta cells and postulate that Slug may act as a prosurvival factor in the pancreas, similar to its function in progenitor cells in numerous other tissues. To address the role of Slug in the pancreas, I propose to: (1) analyze antiapoptotic function of Slug in cultured pancreatic beta cells, and (2) modulate Slug expression in vivo to protect beta cells from apoptosis. We hope that by further understanding the transcriptional networks which function to regulate beta cell survival, therapeutic strategies can be developed to promote and increase in beta cell mass for the prevention or treatment of diabetes.  
Over 20 million Americans currently suffer from diabetes mellitus, and that number is predicted to only increase in the foreseeable future. We believe that by understanding the systems regulating beta cell survival, we can develop methods to either prevent cell loss or promote beta cell regeneration. We hypothesize that the pro-survival factor Slug is a regulator of beta cell death, and experimental manipulation of Slug will allow us to maintain or regenerate beta cell mass in order to treat diabetic individuals.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broader goal of our studies is to understand how epithelia react to damage and in particular the role of the biliary epithelium in the repair and regeneration of the liver. Diseases of the intrahepatic biliary tree (""cholangiopathies"") are severe chronic debilitating liver diseases affecting the pediatric and young adult population. Polycystic liver diseases, a group of genetic cholangiopathies, are characterized by progressive cystic dilations of the biliary epithelium that may cause complications requiring liver transplantation. These diseases are of particular scientific interest because of their association with an altered function of proteins localized on the primary cilia. Adult Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is caused by genetically transmitted defect in polycystin-1 or -2. These proteins function as mechanoceptors, and are involved in signaling pathways that regulate also cell differentiation and epithelial morphogenesis. Epithelial angiogenic signaling, particularly VEGF and Angiopoietin-1, were shown to be upregulated in biliary epithelial cells (cholangiocytes) from ADPKD and may play a role in the pathogenesis of liver disease. The hypothesis addressed in this proposal is that autocrine and paracrine angiogenic signals originating from the biliary epithelium are one of the mechanisms responsible for liver cysts growth and disease progression in ADPKD. This hypothesis will be tested trough three specific aims: 1) to examine the relationships between genetic defects and up-regulation of angiogenic signaling in the biliary epithelium of ADPKD patients; 2) to study the intracellular pathways involved in autocrine VEGF- and angiopoieting-1 mediated stimulation of cholangiocyte growth and survival; 3) To study if blockade of angiogenic signaling reduces liver cysts growth in vivo in ADPKD mouse models. These questions will be addressed in vitro and in vivo using mice with conditional inactivation of polycystin-1 or polycystin 2. These studies will a) increase our understanding of VEGF regulation and signaling in secretory epithelia, b) better clarify the role of VEGF/angiopoietin signaling in liver diseases c) provide important information on mechanisms leading to the progressive growth of cysts in ADPKD d) provide an important proof of concept for the role anti-angiogenic therapy to control the growth of liver and kidney cysts in ADPKD.   
  
Public Health Relevance: Polycystic liver diseases are a group of inherited conditions characterized by an abnormal development of the cells that line the bile ducts. This leads to the formation of multiple biliary microhamartomas that progressively dilate to macroscopic cysts, scattered throughout the liver. Although liver function is usually preserved in these disorders, severe cyst complications (mass effect, hemorrhage, infection or rupture) may develop and require urgent liver transplantation, since no forms of medical treatment are currently available to prevent biliary cyst enlargement. Stimulation of the growth of bile duct cells by angiogenic growth factors aberrantly overexpressed in these disorders may be responsible for the cyst enlargement that leads to the severe complications of the liver disease. In this application we aim to use animals with genetic defects that reproduce this disease in order to understand its cause and to develop new ways to treat its complications. Specifically, we will test antiangiogenic strategies. It is expected that therapeutic strategies devised for the liver may also be effective in the kidney, functional impairment of which contributes to morbidity in these patients. Moreover, the ability to block progression of the disease would not only benefit these patients but could spare organs for transplantation of others.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women and is the most common cancer among women. The primary cause of death in patients with breast cancer is the development of metastasis, a process that is still poorly understood. Characterizing genes that regulate the growth and metastatic ability of breast cancer may identify novel biomarkers to help clinicians guide current treatments, and may offer new targets for therapy. We have identified CCN6 [WISP3 (Wnt-1 induced signaling protein 3)] as being down-regulated in tissue samples of breast cancers with high metastatic ability. CCN6 is a member of the CCN family, which mediate cross-talk between the epithelium and the stroma and regulate fundamental processes including cellular differentiation and growth. Emerging data show that CCN proteins are deregulated in cancer. In studies funded by my K08 award, we have begun to study the role of CCN6 in breast cancer, which was unknown. We showed that CCN6 has tumor inhibitory functions in breast cancer in vivo and in vitro. We discovered that CCN6 interferes with the growth effects of IGF-1 and its signaling pathway in the mammary epithelium. Recently, our laboratory made the novel observation that inhibition of CCN6 in benign breast epithelial cells causes an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) with marked down regulation of E-cadherin. Our central hypothesis is that CCN6 plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. We postulate that loss of CCN6 in the breast promotes tumor growth, invasion and metastasis by (a) regulating the growth effects of IGF-1 on the mammary epithelium, and (b) repressing the E-cadherin complex. CCN6 loss in breast cancer may drive a group of aggressive and metastatic tumors. The specific aims of this project are as follows: Aim 1: To determine the role of CCN6 in regulating the growth of breast cancer in vitro and in vivo and its relationship with IGF-1 signaling pathways; Aim 2: To investigate the biologic implications and the molecular basis of CCN6 mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer; Aim 3: To determine whether CCN6 loss accelerates the growth of mammary tumors and their metastatic potential using well-characterized mouse models of breast tumorigenesis. We will investigate the effect of CCN6 inhibition on the process of EMT and on IGF-1 signaling in vivo using unique human tissue resources consisting of samples of normal breast, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), invasive carcinomas, and nodal and distant metastases. Regulating the expression of CCN6 may represent an important drug target for prevention and cure of breast cancer. These studies have the potential of providing better diagnosis, more accurate predicting of poor prognosis and open the potential for new therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women and is the most common cancer among women. This study addresses an important aspect of women's health, that of how CCN6 regulates the growth and epithelial differentiation of breast tumors and prevents malignant conversion. If we could prevent the loss of CCN6 or reactivate it in metastasizing tumors we would greatly improve breast cancer outcome and save the lives of millions of women. These studies may form the basis of intervention and therapy in breast cancer, potentially preventing premalignant lesions from becoming malignant and metastasizing.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
The pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease (ILD) is largely unknown, and existing treatments are of limited benefit in alleviating the associated high morbidity and mortality. Abnormalities in alveolar type II cell function are commonly implicated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and are central features of ILD associated with mutations in surfactant protein C (SP-C) and the ATP-binding cassette A3 (ABCA-3). Monogenic disorders of lung fibrosis provide a unique opportunity to study fibrogenesis from the vantage point of a primary molecular defect. Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) is an autosomal recessive disorder of organellogenesis, characterized by albinism, platelet dysfunction, and highly penetrant and frequently fatal pulmonary fibrosis in the fourth or fifth decade of life. We have found that the naturally occurring Pearl mouse model of HPS, which has a mutation in the adaptor protein 3 (AP-3) complex required for organelle biogenesis and protein trafficking, has a phenotype that mimics the human condition. The Aims of this proposal are: (1) To determine the mechanisms of dysregulated pulmonary inflammation in Pearl HPS mice, and (2) To determine the mechanisms of fibrotic susceptibility in Pearl HPS mice. Both aims will employ genetic and cellular replacement, with type II cell-specific transgenesis and murine bone marrow transplantation, to define the contributions of alveolar macrophages and alveolar type II cells to the pulmonary phenotype of the Pearl mouse. Our long term objective is to use cellular and molecular insights into alveolar homeostasis and the pathogenesis of HPS lung disease to enhance the understanding and therapeutic approach to more common fibrotic lung disorders. The candidate trained in both pediatric and adult pulmonary medicine and is an Instructor of Pediatrics and Medicine. Her research mentor is Dr. Francis X. McCormack. In order to facilitate her goal of becoming an independent basic investigator with an emphasis on mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis and genetic lung disease, the proposed training plan includes a combination of didactic coursework and mentoring that draws on the expertise in pulmonary biology that exists in Cincinnati. Simply put, this proposal will use a powerful genetic mouse model to understand how scarring occurs in the lung, and how scarring in the lung might be prevented.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease is a major cause of bowel resection. Recurrent inflammation, fibrostenotic disease and obstruction in small intestine frequently lead to repeat surgeries, increasing the risk of intestinal failure or short bowel syndrome. Current therapies do not effectively prevent post-surgical inflammation or fibrosis. A major goal of this research is to develop a new animal model of post- surgical inflammation and fibrosis after ileo-cecal resection (ICR), a common surgical intervention in CD. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) null mice given ICR or sham transection under conventional (CONV) or germ free (GF) conditions will be used to test a hypothesis that bacteria independent factors released by tissue damage during surgery can initiate post-surgical fibrosis and inflammation in susceptible hosts, but commensal microflora are required to sustain chronic post-surgical disease. Adaptive growth of remnant small intestine or colon protects against intestinal failure after bowel resection, but little is known about the effects of bacteria or active IBD on intestinal adaptation. Proposed studies will test the hypothesis that commensal microflora or active IBD impact on early ICR-induced expansion of stem cells or long-term adaptive growth of intestine. Specific aims are as follows: Aim #1: will analyze post-surgical inflammation and fibrosis in CONV IL-10 null or WT mice after ICR or sham transection, and establish if post-surgical small bowel disease in IL-10 null mice progresses to stenosis, obstruction or intestinal failure. These studies will also test if tissue damage associated pattern signals (DAMPS) or receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGE) correlate with initiation or perpetuation of post-surgical inflammation or fibrosis. Aim #2 will analyze responses to ICR in germ free (GF) IL-10 null and WT mice to define if bacteria-independent factors can initiate or sustain post-surgical inflammation or fibrosis in susceptible IL-10 null mice, and if this correlates with up-regulation of DAMPS or RAGE. Aim#3 will analyze crypt stem cells and long-term adaptive growth in the intestine of GF and CONV WT or IL-10 null mice after ICR, to define the role of commensal microflora or active IBD in adaptive growth responses to bowel resection.   
  
Animal models and information derived from these exploratory studies will provide the basis for more extensive future experiments to define new mechanisms or causative factors underlying recurrent inflammation and fibrosis after surgery for CD, and test new preventative or therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing the risk of intestinal failure.Multiple surgeries for Crohn's disease can cause intestinal failure and the devastating condition of short bowel syndrome, leading to temporary or long-term requirement for intravenous feeding. Fibrostenosing disease and obstruction are common causes of intestinal failure yet there are no therapies to prevent these complications. This research will develop new animal models that will permit better understanding of mechanisms that lead to intestinal failure, and testing of new therapies that may prevent a condition that compromises quality of life and poses a major burden in health care costs.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): During cardiac development, valve progenitors first arise in the atrioventricular canal as a result of a TGF¿-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal cell transformation (EMT). Prior studies showed that this EMT can be divided into two stages, an activation stage and an invasion stage. Stage 1 is mediated, in part, by transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF¿2) and stage 2 is mediated, in part, by TGF¿3. Previous work showed that EMT can be disrupted by the inhibition of 5 different TGF¿ receptors, TGF¿ receptor II, TGF¿ receptor III, Endoglin, ALK2 and ALK5. It is our hypothesis that there are two more discrete signaling complexes mediating TGF¿-regulated EMT. To continue the analysis of TGF¿-mediated regulation of normal heart development, the first aim will examine the correlation between specific TGF¿ isoforms and receptors in mediating EMT regulation. Microarray experiments will be performed to assess the effect loss of specific TGF¿ isoforms on altered gene expression in tissues prior to EMT, during EMT and in mesenchymal cells after EMT. Selected markers among the TGF¿-regulated genes will then be used to assess whether gene expression is altered as each of the specific receptors is disrupted. Correlations between these data will point to specific receptor and ligand signaling complexes that mediate EMT. These putative complexes will be confirmed at the protein level. Data from other labs has implicated a variety of signal transduction mechanisms and intracellular regulators in cardiac EMT including ErbB2, NF-1, VEGF and NFATc1. In the second aim, experiments will be undertaken to determine whether disruption of TGF¿ signaling alters any of the other candidate mechanisms or whether loss of these molecules alters TGF¿ ligand or receptor expression. It was observed in the neural crest system that forced expression of Sox 8, 9 or 10 in the neural tube would cause an EMT and produce ectopic neural crest cells. We conjecture that this is analogous to the cell invasion step in the heart and that it requires some TGF¿ activity. In the third aim, experiments will be undertaken to determine whether exogenous expression of Sox genes will force EMT and whether Sox gene expression is regulated by TGF¿ signal transduction or regulates TGF¿-mediated responses. Together these experiments will shed new light on the mechanisms of EMT regulation and aid in an understanding of congenital heart disease.

In many oxygen sensitive tissues, hypoxic stress induces the expression of genes whose products act in concert to facilitate the supply of metabolic energy. Among these are genes coding for erythropoietin (EPO), vasoactive endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the glucose transporters, nitric oxide synthetase and tyrosine hydroxylase. In skeletal tissue, intramembranous and endochondral ossification occur in close association and proximity to capillary in-growth and angiogenesis. In addition, disruption of normal afferent blood supply occurs following fracture and leads to hypoxia of adjacent tissue. Based on these observations, we reasoned that cells of mesenchymal origin including osteoblasts were ideally positioned in bone to sense and respond to fluctuations in oxygen and nutrient supply. Consistent with this concept, osteoblasts and osteocytes respond to hypoxia by elevating the level of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), an evolutionarily conserved master regulator of the hypoxic response, which in turn, transactivates VEGF and other HIF-1 target genes. We therefore hypothesize that osteoblasts use the HIF-1alpha pathway to sense reduced oxygen tension and transmit signals that impinge on angiogenic and osteogenic gene programs. To test this hypothesis we will use genetically altered mice to determine the cellular and molecular impact of gain of HIF-1alpha function through targeted overexpression of a stable HIF-1 molecule or loss of HIF-1alpha by conditional mutagenesis in osteoblasts during bone development and following bone injury. Complementary in vitro studies in primary osteoblasts will attempt to determine whether HIF-1alpha impacts osteoblast growth and differentiation independent of the vasculature.","277987",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) is a leading cause of death and disfigurement. A major limitation to improving treatment outcomes and survival has been a lack of understanding regarding cellular mechanisms involved in carcinogenic growth of relevant cells and thus a lack of mechanistically targeted therapies. Recent studies indicate that human papillomavirus (HPV) plays a major role in the development of HNSCC. Up to 60% of tonsillar SCC may be attributable to HPV infections. Compelling evidence indicates that HPV-related HNSCC is more common in patients with HIV, and recent studies suggest that antiretroviral therapies have no effect on reducing HPV-associated lesions. Despite the development of a prophylactic vaccine for HPV, there is no evidence that the vaccine would be effective at preventing HNSCC, particularly cancers associated with HIV infection. We have developed a unique in vitro and in vivo model system using human and mouse tonsillar epithelial cells to study progression to invasive malignancy. Our long-term goal is to understand key events of HPV-related tonsil epithelial cell transformation, and to use this information to develop molecular therapies that may be applicable to both HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC. We propose that HPV-mediated transformation and progression to malignancy depends on a novel HPV16 E6 oncoprotein function that is associated with its PDZ binding motif. We hypothesize that E6 mediated degradation of a PDZ containing tyrosine phosphatase, PTP-BL/FAP-1, is critical for an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and anchorage independent growth (AIG), both key changes associated with the development of carcinomas. In these studies we will determine 1) what factors are required for malignant transformation of mouse and human tonsillar epithelial cells and whether loss of PTP-BL/FAP-1 is critical for this process, 2) how HPV E6 specifically degrades PTP-BL/FAP-1, and 3) the molecular mechanisms by which loss of PTP-BL/FAP-1 causes EMT and malignant progression. These studies will provide critical data for designing strategies to overcome EG-mediated transformation and may provide insight into treating non-HPV associated cancers. The knowledge gained from this work should make it possible to refine diagnostic and therapeutic methods for the treatment of HNSCC, an area of considerable unmet medical need, particularly in patients who suffer from complications associated with AIDS.

A complex interplay
 between certain lung cells is known to be important in the fibrotic process, although the exact identity of the cells and their
 precise in vivo roles have not been unequivocally determined. The eosinophil is found in many fibrotic conditions and lesions,
and is known to express several key cytokines with fibrogenic activities, including monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1),
transforming growth factors a (TGFa) and (}(TGFp). It thus represents a potentially important source of such cytokines in
these fibrotic lesions, thus identifying a potential role for eosinophils in fibrogenesis. Tissue recruitment of eosinophils is
found to be dependent on interleukin-5 (IL-5) and several CC type chemokines, especially eotaxin. Human pulmonary fibrosis
and fibrosis of the airway walls in asthma are associated with significant influx of eosinophils, and an increase in lung
eosinophils indicates a worst prognosis and resistance to treatment in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Despite this suggestive
evidence, the role of eosinophils in pulmonary fibrosis requires further elucidation. The central hypothesis of this proposal is
 that recruitment of eosinophils into the lung and their activation by certain chemokines/cytokines result in increased expression
of fibrogenic cytokines such as TGFP, which will in turn cause the recruitment, proliferation and activation of fibroblasts with
differentiation to myofibroblasts. These latter cells are ultimately responsible for the increased deposition of extracellular
matrix in the fibrotic lung. To test this hypothesis, four specific aims are proposed: 1) characterize the elaboration of eotaxin
and related CC chemokines in a rodent model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and identify the cells responsible for
elaboration of injury-induced chemokines, and examination of associated regulatory mechanisms; 2) determine the role of
these chemokines in pulmonary fibrosis and eosinophil recruitment, activation and apoptosis, using neutralizingantibodies (to
chemokines and cognate receptors) and transgenic knockout mice; 3) analyze the regulatory role of eosinophils on fibroblast
activation and myofibroblast differentiation in vitro, and identify the mediators involved, and 4) examine the ability of
exogenous eotaxin and/or IL-5 treatment (as well as by IL-5 transgenic over-expression), and transferred eosinophils from
fibrotic lungs, to exacerbate pulmonary fibrosis. A combination of immunohistochemical, histochemical and in situ
hybridization methods will be used to identify cells and expression of specific cytokines by these cells in tissues from diseased

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major cause of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) in the Western Hemisphere is chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy, which is due to infection by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. About 30% of infected individuals develop the cardiac form of the disease, usually decades after the primary infection.  Cardiac chagasic patients present cardiomegaly, electrical and mechanical disturbances of heart function.  The disease evolutes to congestive heart failure and the only currently available therapy is heart transplantation.  Performing heart transplants in chagasic patients is not only expensive, but also problematic, as immunosuppressive drugs can bring about patient parasitemia due to persistent parasitism in the chronic phase of infection. Supported by NIH funding during initial RO1 award, we have tested efficacy of an alternative therapeutic procedure in a mouse model of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC), based on transplantation of the mononuclear fraction of the bone marrow (BMCs). Quantification of heart inflammatory foci and degree of fibrosis using confocal microscopy and morphometric analysis, as well as functional and structural analysis through MRI, electro- and echocardiography, and array analysis of gene expression in treated vs. infected mice all indicate that BMC is a very effective treatment that both prevents disease progression and restores cardiac function.  These studies, and human clinical trials underway, raise issues regarding whether other cell types might be even more efficacious, and also raise the question of whether improvement is due to paracrine action of the stem cells or to direct engraftment. This application, from a consortium of senior investigators and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed studies will compare alternative sources of stem cells for treatment of CCC in the mouse model and will use both cell culture and in vivo strategies to test hypotheses regarding mechanisms of stem cell-based improvement in CCC.  These experiments are expected to provide new insights into most effective stem cell treatments for CHF and also into basic mechanisms of stem cell biology and stem cell therapy. RELEVENCE: Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy is a debilitating disease manifested by CHF, arrhythmias and embolic events. It is a devastating disease with a great economic and social burden in endemic areas of the world. There is no cure and heart transplantation, with all of its complications, is often the only life-saving remedy. Chagas disease is now recognized more frequently in the United States because of increased immigration.  Stem cell transplantation provides a new and exciting modality in the management of patients with chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy. The experimental studies detailed in this application will provide valuable basic information required for the clinical trials that are both planned and already underway in Brazil.

We found that IL-10 inhibits granulomatous inflammation, with IL-10-/- mice developing much larger granulomas in the gut and liver, but, paradoxically, displaying reduced liver fibrosis following acute Schistosoma mansoni infection.  Interestingly, the reduced pathological responses in IL-10-/- mice were associated with increased IL-13R&#945;2 production in the serum and liver. Therefore, to determine whether the observed changes in IL-13R&#945;2 expression were responsible for the modified pathological responses in IL-10-/- mice, we generated IL-10-/-IL-13R&#945;2-/- double-KO (dKO) mice.  We found that dKO mice developed significantly more fibrosis compared with either single-KO mouse, demonstrating that IL-13R&#945;2 cooperates with IL-10 to control Th2-driven fibrosis. To determine whether local changes in Th2 effector function were responsible for the exacerbated fibrotic responses in the dKO mice, three distinct subsets of genes were analyzed, including markers of alternative macrophage activation (Ym1 and FIZZ1), MMPs (MMP-9 and MMP-12), and interstitial collagens (COL III and COL VI), all linked with Th2 effector responses. Interestingly, deletion of IL-10 alone had little effect. However, deleting IL-13R&#945;2 alone or in combination with IL-10 led to significantly increased Ym-1, FIZZ-1, MMP-9, MMP-12, pro-Col III, and pro-Col VI mRNA expression when compared with WT mice. These data suggest that IL-13R&#945;2 is the dominant regulator of IL-13 effector responses in the tissues. In fact, the only consistent difference between IL-13R&#945;2-/- and dKO mice was a slight increase in Ym-1 and MMP-9 and a small but significant increase in MMP-12 and IL-5 in the dKO mice. Thus, although -10 and IL-13R&#945;2 both regulate Th2-driven disease, they target distinct pathological features, with IL-10 inhibiting inflammation and IL-13R&#945;2 suppressing IL-13dependent effector responses (i.e. fibrosis).

2)  Because the IL-4R&#945; chain functions as the primary signaling receptor for IL-4 and IL-13, it has been the most widely studied of the four receptor subunits that engage these cytokines.  However, while it is now clear that the IL-4R&#945; chain plays a central role in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of Th2-associated diseases including schistosomiasis, thus far it has been impossible to assign the various functions of the IL-4R&#945; to either the Type-I or Type-II IL-4R signaling pathways, because both receptor signaling pathways are deleted in IL-4Ra-deficient animals.  Therefore, to elucidate the contributions of the Type-II receptor, we generated mice with a targeted deletion of the IL13Ra1 gene and examined the effects on Th2 response development and fibrosis in schistosomiasis.  Survival studies were performed with S. mansoni and as expected, by wk 10 of infection, greater than 75% of IL-4/IL-13 dKO (Type-I and Type-II receptor signaling blocked) had succumbed to the infection.  In contrast, only 50% mortality was observed in the WT group by wk 18.  Strikingly however, more than 80% of the IL-13R&#945;1-/- mice survived through week 22, demonstrating that type-II IL-4R was highly pathogenic during S. mansoni infection, while the Type-I receptor played a protective function. The enhanced survival of the chronically infected IL-13R&#945;1-/- mice was also associated with a marked reduction in fibrosis, determined by both hydroxyproline assay and by picrosirius red staining of tissue sections.  In addition, markers of hepatocellular damage and biliary obstruction (alanine aminotransferase ALT, aspartate aminotransferase AST, and alkaline phosphatase AP) were also significantly decreased in the sera of chronically infected IL-13R&#945;1-/- mice. 
Functional studies suggested that the type-II IL-4R was involved in the activation of important mesenchymal cells, like fibroblasts and epithelial cells, which contribute to the development of fibrosis and mortality in schistosomiasis. As such, these findings suggest that for some chronic fibrotic diseases, it may be advantageous to inhibit the pathogenic type-II IL-4R while leaving the protective type-I IL-4R pathway intact","1523013",

Furthermore we have demonstrated that the HDAC inhibitor Depsipeptide FK228 (DP) enhances       DAC-mediated induction of CT-X genes in lung cancer cells. Induction of CT-X gene expression       by sequential DAC/DP treatment coincided with a dramatic increase in BORIS expression in lung       cancer cells. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) and sodium bisulfite sequencing experiments       demonstrated that activation of BORIS in cultured lung cancer cells coincided with       demethylation of a CpG island within the BORIS promoter. Additional MSP experiments revealed       de-repression of BORIS in 6 of 12 primary lung cancer specimens; in several patients,       de-repression of BORIS was detected in lung cancers as well as histologically normal tissue       adjacent to these neoplasms, raising the possibility that activation of BORIS is an early       epigenetic event during pulmonary carcinogenesis. Subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift       assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments demonstrated that BORIS       physically interacts with the NY-ESO-1 promoter, and that de-repression of NY-ESO-1 in lung       cancer cells coincides with a CTCF-to-BORIS shift in occupancy within the NY-ESO-1 promoter. A       similar phenomenon was observed for MAGE-A1 activation in lung cancer cells. Additional       studies were undertaken to further examine the mechanisms by which BORIS contributes to       transcriptional regulation of NY-ESO-1. Software guided analysis of the NY-ESO-1 promoter       region revealed a variety of potential transcription factor binding sites including several       SP1 motifs. Western blot experiments demonstrated that sequential DAC/DP treatment enhanced       nuclear translocation of SP1 in lung cancer cells. Transient transfection assays using       deletion mutant promoter-reporter constructs, as well as EMSA and ChIP experiments       demonstrated that NY-ESO-1 promoter activity coincided with occupancy of the proximal SP1       binding site in lung cancer cells. Mutations within the SP1 recognition sequence eliminated       binding of SP1 to this motif in vitro, and markedly diminished NY-ESO-1 promoter activity in       vivo (Figure 1). Additional experiments using siRNA techniques revealed that inhibition of SP1       expression decreased NY-ESO-1 promoter activity, whereas knock-down of CTCF augmented       expression of this CT-X gene in lung cancer cells. Immunoprecipitation experiments       demonstrated that SP1 physically interacts with BORIS, but not with CTCF in vivo. Collectively       these data suggested that BORIS recruits SP1 to de-repress NY-ESO-1 (and possibly other CT-X       genes) in lung cancer cells. Because histologically normal epithelia as well as premalignant       lesions adjacent to established lung cancers exhibit de-repression of BORIS, it is conceivable       that de-repression of this germ cell transcription factor contributes to initiation and       maintenance of the transformed phenotype of lung cancer cells. As such, a series of       experiments were initiated to comprehensively investigate the effects of BORIS expression in       SV40- or cdk4/h-tert- immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS, and HBEC,       respectively), which are deficient for BORIS and CT-X gene expression, as well as Calu-6 (p53       null) and A549 (p53 wt) lung cancer cells exhibiting extremely low level BORIS and CT-X gene       expression. Interestingly, BEAS cells transduced with BORIS exhibited loss of contact       inhibition, increased proliferation and invasion, as well as enhanced clonogenic potential       following tetracycline exposure relative to control cells. This phenomenon appeared to       coincide with silencing of E-cadherin, a gene known to regulate epithelial-mesenchymal       transition, which has been implicated in cancer metastasis. Additional studies are in progress       to further evaluate the effects of BORIS expression regarding proliferation, tumorigenicity,       and chemo/XRT sensitivity of lung cancer cells. These studied could reveal novel epigenetic       biomarkers of prognosis in lung cancer patients.","520139",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
  
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease that culminates in progressive loss of pulmonary function and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Additionally, many IPF patients will experience an acute worsening of symptoms due to known causes (e.g. infection) or of idiopathic nature termed ""acute exacerbations"". Circulating, bone-marrow-derived cells known as fibrocytes (identified by shared leukocyte and mesenchymal markers) may be regulators of IPF pathogenesis. Fibrocyte numbers are increased in patients with IPF and murine fibrosis studies have demonstrated that fibrocytes are 1) recruited to the lung by chemokines 2) adoptive transfer of fibrocytes worsen disease and 3) fibrocyte recruitment correlates with infectious exacerbations. Thus, absolute numbers of fibrocytes, or particular fibrocyte phenotypes, may serve as novel biomarkers in IPF. The IPF network (IPFnet) is the parent organization that will oversee the PANTHER trial which is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of prednisone + azathioprine + N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or NAC alone versus placebo in IPF patients with mild- moderate disease (130 patients in each arm followed up to 67 weeks). The second trial is the STEP trial to test sildenafil in IPF patients with severe disease over a 12 week period (85 patients in both the treatment and placebo arms). All these patients will be well characterized for diagnosis, physiology, disease progression and adverse events. The studies proposed in this grant would take advantage of the large and diverse IPF patient populations enrolled in these trials and the abundant clinical/physiological data collected over time on each patient to perform longitudinal and cross-sectional studies to characterize fibrocyte numbers and phenotypes in an effort to provide mechanistic correlations into the natural history of IPF and response to therapy. In addition, we will compare IPF fibrocyte phenotypes to those obtained from disease-specific control patients including patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and scleroderma as well as normal volunteers. We hypothesize that absolute numbers of fibrocytes, or distinctive fibrocyte phenotypes (chemokine receptor expression, collagen synthetic capacity, secretion of pro-fibrotic mediators or proliferation) will correlate with severity of disease at entry, rate of progression of disease, response to therapy and occurrence of acute exacerbations. The IPFnet steering committee recognizes the value of these mechanistic studies and fully supports this application. Aim 1) To determine whether absolute numbers of fibrocytes or alterations in fibrocyte phenotype differentiate between normal, COPD, scleroderma and IPF subjects. Aim 2) To determine whether changes in fibrocyte numbers or alterations in fibrocyte phenotype(s) predict severity of disease, changes in physiology or response to therapy in IPF and control patients. Aim 3) To determine whether changes in absolute numbers of alterations in fibrocyte phenotype(s) correlate with acute deteriorations or differentiate between acute exacerbations of known and unknown cause. Statement of Relevance Fibrocyte phenotypes have been validated as biomarkers in murine models of fibrosis. Our proposed studies would be the first to provide longitudinal and cross sectional analyses of fibrocyte phenotypes as biomarkers in human fibrotic lung disease. (End of Abstract)

and semiquantitative and quantitative histopathologic analysis. Of direct relevance to this program project,
Dr. Grande has worked closely with the Directors of Projects 1 and 2 in analyzing histologic sections obtained
from the pig renal artery stenosis model (1-6). Dr. Grande has also collaborated with the Director of Project 4 in
both clinical and experimental studies (4, 6-9).Dr. Grande has established an infrastructure for processing
tissue sections, including a Dako Automated Stainer, which will minimize batch to batch variability in
immunostaining protocols and a MetaVue Image analysis system which will facilitate quantitative analysis of
markers of interstitial fibrosis, inflammation, and proliferation. Ms. Gina Warner has served as Lead Technician
in Doctor Grande's laboratory for the past 8 years and is highly qualified to perform antibody development,
tissue staining, and computer assisted quantitative image analysis. Ms. Warner will also be responsible for
blinding the samples so they can be interpreted in an unbiased fashion.
Sample Preparation. Renal tissue will be fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in
paraffin, per standard techniques. Histologic sections, 4 jam, thick, will be prepared. Representative sections
will be stained with H&E, PAS, and trichrpme stains. Additional unstained slides will be prepared for Sirius red
staining, and immunohistochemical staining for a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), collagens III and IV, p-ERK,
Mib-1, p21, p27, and TGF-p1.
Immunostaining of renal tissue often cannot be performed by clinical immunopathology laboratories because
the slides often have to be treated differently than other tissues. For example, high endogenous biotin content
in renal tissue produces an extremely high background when protocols that work well in other tissues are
employed. In addition, many of the antibodies that work on human tissues do not work well in murine or
porcine tissue. The core will support the infrastructure necessary to systematically optimize and validate all of
the antibodies which are an integral part of the experimental protocols outlined in Projects 1-4. Our laboratory
has implemented a number of immunostains for clinical use and in support of research studies (see table for
list of antibodies). Examples from studies published within the past two years are highlighted in references (6,
10-16) in the bibliography. Many of the antibodies (TGF-p1, matrix proteins, Mib-1, etc.) have already been
validated in our research laboratory.

 Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle):
As necessary, antigen retrieval will be performed by heat
treatment in EOTA for 30 minutes, using a vegetable steamer.
Enzyme treatment will be performed as required for various
antibodies (collagen IV requires pepsin treatment, TGF(31 and
collagen III require trypsin treatment). Commercially available
kits (Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, and Envision
Plus HRP kit, DakoCytomation) will be used for many of the
blocking, secondary antibody and amplification steps. As
necessary, reagents to block endogenous biotin activity will be
used. Color development will be performed using NovaRed
(Vector Laboratories) followed by hematoxylin counterstain. To
facilitate consistency between staining batches, most of the
stains will be performed on the Dako Autostainer, an
automated staining machine. Staining reagents used with the
machine include TBS-T, distilled water and DakoCytomation
Special Stains Wash Buffer. Controls will include irrelevant
isotype-specific antibody. A critical feature of the core is
support of a dedicated technologist (Ms. Warner) who will
standardize the staining protocols to ensure day-to-day
reproducibility of the stains.
Semiauantitative Histopatholoaic Analysis: Interpretation of
studies outlined in Projects 1-4 is heavily dependent upon
histopathologic analysis, which requires standardized and
reproducible staining protocols (see above) as well as
semiquantitative and quantitative histopathologic analysis, both
of which will be provided by the Histopathology Core. The Core
Director will perform semiquantitative histologic scoring, in a
blinded fashion, on H&E, PAS, and trichrome stained slides;
see Figure 1. The scoring system assigns points (0-3) for
glomerular, interstitial, tubular, and vascular features of the
renal tissue. The scoring system is similar to that previously
used in a cohort of 148 biopsies obtained from patients with
IgA nephropathy (17) and modified to include Banff criteria for
assessment of renal biopsies (7, 18). In brief,
glomerulosclerosis will be reported as number of sclerotic

analyzed as absent (0), mild (1, involving <25% of glomeruli),
moderate (2, involving 26-50% of glomeruli), and severe (3,

sclerotic glomeruli will also be reported as a percent of total
glomeruli and reported on a 0-3+ scale (see above). Additional
glomerular features, including matrix increase, capillary loop
narrowing, ischemic changes (wrinkling and folding), and
mesangial cellularity will also be reported, as previously
described. For the tubulointerstitial compartment, the extent of
interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial infiltrates are
scored as absent (0), involving <25% of the cortical surface
area (1), involving 26-50% of the cortical surface area (2), and
involving >50% of the cortical surface area (3). The presence
of tubular dilatation, epithelial cell vacuolization, tubular
atrophy, casts, or edema will be scored as absent (0), isolated

tubules (3). Reduction in vascular caliber due to sclerosis or
hyalinization is scored as absent (0), <25% luminal diameter

intima relative to the total medial thickness and quantitated as normal (0), <25% medial thickness (1), intimal
thickness <50% medial thickness (2), and intimal thickness >50% medial thickness (3). Medial hypertrophy is
assessed by comparing the thickness of the muscular wall relative to the vascular caliber and is
semiquantitatively assessed as normal (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). Mean glomerular size and
vascular media to total thickness ratios will be assessed by quantitative analysis (see below).
Quantitative Assessment of Histopathologic Features, including Interstitial Fibrosis and Matrix Proteins:
Methodologies will be as described in our recent publication (18); see Figure 1. Proliferative activity will be
assessed as the number of positively staining nuclei/surface area of sections stained for Mib-1 (Projects 1-4),
The MetaVue Image Analysis System will be used to evaluate mean glomerular planar surface area (of
glomeruli containing the vascular pole) to complement the semiquantitative analysis of glomerular size
described above. Glomerular size is used as a marker of renal hypertrophy. The core will assist with studies to
determine protein/DNA ratios as an additional index of hypertrophy (DNA as assayed by spectrophotometric
analysis of perchloric acid digest of renal cortex, as previously reported by us (19). Similarly, the number of
cells staining positively for cell cycle regulatory molecules (p-ERK, p21, p27) will be assessed as the number of
cells positively staining/cortical surface area. Glomeruli, tubules, interstitium, and vessels will be assessed
separately. Interstitial fibrosis will be assessed over the entire renal cortex of Sirius red-stained slides as the
relative amount of red staining material (observed under non-polarized light), or birefringent material (observed
under polarized light), relative to the entire cortical surface area, as assessed by the MetaVue Image Analysis
System. The percent of cortical surface area staining positively for a-smooth muscle actin will be quantitatively
assessed with the MetaVue Image Analysis System. In serial sections, epithelial to mesenchymal
transformation will be assessed as decreased E-cadherin staining of tubular epithelial cells, with increase in a-
smooth muscle actin staining. This will be semiquantitatively reported as absent, mild, moderate, and severe
(>50% cortical surface area). In select cases, we will perform double immunohistochemical staining for E-
cadherin and a-SMA to identify and localize cells undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transformation.
Immunohistochemical stains for collagens III (as a marker of interstitial fibrosis) and IV (as a marker of tubular!
basement membrane thickening), and TGF-p1 will be expressed as percent cortical surface area staining)
positively for these markers, as assessed by the MetaVue Image Analysis System.
TGF-B ELISA. We have developed this method for use in clinical samples and will support Project 4 (20, 21).
Human urine samples (20 ml each, if possible) will be concentrated using Centriplus centrifugal filters with a
10,000 molecular weight cutoff (Amicon YM-10). Urines are centrifuged at 5000 x g at 25¿ C until the
concentrate volume is approximately 300-500 j^l. Urines will be concentrated from 10- to 40-fold, depending on
the start volume. Plasma samples do not require concentration. The ELISA will be performed using Quantikine
TGF-pl ELISA Kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Kits are available for human samples. The assay will be
completed following the R&D protocol, and the plate will be read on a Spectramax Plus 384 plate reader.
Results will be in pg/mL after adjusting each sample for fold dilution and fold concentration.
Statistical Analysis: All histologic sections will be read in a blinded fashion. Semiquantitative and quantitative
data will be entered into an Excel Spreadsheet linked to the MetaVue Image Analysis System. The
histotechnologist will calculate mean +/- SEM for all data. Comparisons between multiple groups (stenotic vs
contralateral kidney; sham vs contralateral kidney) will be made by ANOVA, using Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons, followed by the unpaired Students' t-test.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most prevalent hematological malignancy and it remains incurable with a median survival of 3-5 years. Novel therapeutic agents including bortezomib, thalidomide and lenalidomide have led to a significant advancement in the treatment of patients with this disease. However, only 25-35% of patients respond to these agents in the relapsed setting. The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment plays a pivotal role in the resistance of MM cells to therapeutic agents. We propose a clinical trial that targets the process of trafficking of MM cells and disrupt the interaction of MM cells with their microenvironment by releasing them from their protective niches into the peripheral circulation where they are more sensitive to apoptosis by other therapeutic agents. In our preliminary data, we demonstrate that the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 leads to mobilization of MM cells from the BM into the peripheral blood in vivo, and that the kinetics of this process are different between MM cells and stem cells. In addition, we show that the combination of AMD3100 and bortezomib leads to an increase in mobilization of apoptotic MM cells into the peripheral circulation and a decrease in tumor burden in vivo. We hypothesize that disruption of the interaction of MM cells with their microenvironment will change their biologic properties and induce sensitivity to apoptosis. We will test this hypothesis in 3 specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To determine the safety, induction of mobilization of MM cells, and tumor response of the combination of AMD3100 and bortezomib in patients with MM through a phase I/II clinical trial in patients with relapsed MM. Specific Aim 2: To determine the biological sequelae that occur in MM cells confined to the BM compared to those outside of the BM microenvironment. Specific Aim 3: To determine the biological sequelae which occur in the BM microenvironment in response to AMD3100 and bortezomib. These studies are innovative as they represent the first in vivo trials that modulate trafficking of MM cells in patients in order to disrupt their interaction with the BM microenvironment and render them more sensitive to apoptosis. Through this clinical trial, we will investigate the biological effects of modulating cell trafficking of MM cells and other cellular and humoral components of the BM. Understanding the pathways that regulate MM cells' trafficking are critical to rationally design future therapeutic trials that specifically target the capacity of MM cells to reside in their protective environment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The bone marrow microenvironment induces resistance to multiple myeloma cells and prevents their cell killing by chemotherapies. We propose a clinical trial where we will mobilize the myeloma cells out of their protective niches in the bone marrow and make them circulate in the blood where they can be easily killed by the drug bortezomib. We will perform correlative studies along with this clinical trial to understand the mechanisms of circulation of these cells out of the bone marrow.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kr¿ppel-like factor 5 (KLF5; IKLF; BTEB2), a zinc-finger transcription factor with pro-proliferative properties in vitro, is expressed in proliferating cells of gastrointestinal tract epithelia, including the basal cells of the esophagus. The interplay of these cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical to their function, and we have shown that Klf5 regulates proliferation in esophageal epithelial cells through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In novel preliminary data, we demonstrate that Klf5 increases migration via the integrin- linked kinase (ILK) in primary esophageal keratinocytes in culture. Given these findings, Klf5 is an excellent candidate to orchestrate esophageal epithelial cell proliferation and migration in vivo. However, despite significant evidence of a pro-proliferative role for KLF5 in non-transformed epithelial cells, KLF5 inhibits proliferation, promotes anoikis, and decreases invasion of esophageal squamous cancer cells. KLF5 is also deleted or down-regulated in human breast and prostate cancers, as well as intestinal adenomas from mice and humans. In epithelial cancer cells, KLF5 protein undergoes more rapid degradation than in non- transformed epithelial cells. These findings suggest that extinction of KLF5 function may be important for carcinogenesis. In fact, KLF5 has been suggested to have tumor suppressive functions in human breast, prostate, esophageal, and colon cancers. This dichotomous role for KLF5 is not unique, as divergent functions have been reported for other factors, such as TGF?, Notch, and KLF4. Here, we will investigate the role of KLF5 in normal and transformed esophagus by testing the following hypotheses: (1) KLF5 is a critical regulator of proliferation, differentiation, and migration in transit amplifying cells of the esophagus; and (2) loss of KLF5 is a key step in malignant transformation in the esophagus. We will test these hypotheses through the following interrelated Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the role of KLF5 in esophageal epithelial homeostasis by: (a) evaluating integrin, integrin-linked kinase (ILK), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling in non-transformed keratinocytes with overexpression or suppression of KLF5; (b) studying the transcriptional regulation of EGFR and ILK by KLF5; (c) examining mice with transgenic expression of Klf5 in the esophagus. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the function of KLF5 during esophageal tumorigenesis by: (a) examining the regulation of the integrin, ILK, and EGFR pathways by KLF5 in transformed esophageal squamous cells; and (b) evaluating dysplasia and tumor formation in mice with transgenic expression of Klf5 in esophagus which have been treated with the carcinogen NMBA or crossed with ED-L2/cyclin D1 transgenic mice, an established genetic cancer model. Overall, an understanding of the pathways regulated by KLF5 in esophageal epithelia will provide a framework to understand the molecular events underlying esophageal diseases, both benign and malignant. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Diseases of the esophagus, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease and esophageal cancer, are among the most common ailments in the United States and throughout the world, and these diseases result from dysregulation of normal epithelial homeostasis. Thus, an appreciation of the molecular mechanisms, including the specific factors and complex signaling arrays, which govern normal esophageal proliferation and differentiation is critical to the understanding of esophageal diseases, both benign and malignant. The research proposed in this application aims to elucidate these factors and signaling pathways through studies of the key regulatory protein KLF5.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer causes more mortality in the United States than any other form of cancer. Non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common form of the disease, constituting over 85% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer. The poor clinical prognosis for NSCLC is due to late stage diagnosis and high frequency of metastatic disease. NF-?B is an immediate-early transcription factor that is commonly up regulated in NSCLC tumors. NSCLC tumors display elevated NF-?B activity, which correlates with invasive de-differentiated morphology, tumor staging, and poor clinical outcomes. Many laboratories, including our own, have shown that NF-?B provides cellular resistance to many forms of apoptosis. To understand better how NSCLC cells resist apoptotic cues, we have characterized the molecular pathways used by NF-?B to block apoptosis. Preliminary data presented in this proposal indicate that the p65 component of NF-?B provides a novel avenue of cell survival by blocking detachment from the extracellular matrix. Pro inflammatory cytokines inhibit this form of apoptosis in a process referred to as anoikis. Both IKK and p65 activities are required to block anoikis by inhibiting Bim, a pro-apoptotic protein important for induction of anoikis in NSCLC cells. IKK and p65 are required to stimulate Bim protein turnover in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines. IKK¿ directly phosphorylates Bim, regulating its half-life through a process involving polyubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Knockdown of the adaptor molecule COMMD1, a member of ECSSOCS1 E3 ligase complex that regulates p65 degradation, results in a significant up regulation of endogenous Bim protein expression. Using an in vitro model for invasion and metastasis that induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we demonstrate that pro-inflammatory cytokines facilitate TGF¿-induced EMT. The EMT phenotype is associated with an elevation in IKK and p65 activity, loss of Bim expression, and resistance to anoikis. Since EMT has been proposed to link de-differentiation with the self-renewing properties observed in cancer stem cells, we hypothesize that loss of Bim protein expression is one of the rate-limiting steps in NSCLC metastasis. The goal of this proposal is to understand how p65 regulates Bim protein turnover and to determine whether this pro-inflammatory responsive mechanism governs NSCLC metastasis. To address our hypothesis three Specific Aims will be addressed. Aim 1 will determine whether stimulation or inactivation of IKK and p65 activities alters the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to anoikis. Experiments will identify the minimal interacting domain required to stimulate Bim degradation and will determine if localization of p65 to the microtubule complex or to the mitochondria alters Bim induced apoptosis. Aim 2 will determine the importance of the COMMD1-containing E3 ligase for ubiquitination of Bim and will determine the role of p65 and IKK in this process. Aim 3 will use in vitro and in vivo models to determine whether regulation of Bim protein stability governs EMT and metastasis in lung cancer cells. Understanding the mechanisms used by inflammatory mediators to stimulate Bim degradation will potentially result in the identification of novel approaches to preventing NSCLC metastasis.

Many diseases, including diabetes, Alzheimer's, and heart disease, are caused by the death of cells in major
organs. To treat these diseases, the lost cells must be replaced, ideally with autologous cells. Such cells will
have to be induced to change their lineage and engraft into a new environment, a process collectively called
transdifferentiation. Stem cells from the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin, offer advantages over other
types of adult stem cells in that they can be isolated with little harm to the individual and, since the skin is the
largest organ in the body, they are present in large quantities. Therefore, determining the mechanism behind
transdifferentiating epidermal stem cells and their potential for tissue regeneration has clinical significance.","NIAMS","7630657","6/23/2008 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","3R21AR053936-01A2S1","3","R21","AR","053936","01","A2S","BAKER, CARL","9/10/2007 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section[ACTS]"," ","1865144","BICKENBACH, JACKIE R","Not Applicable","02","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.662689","-91.547715","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","6/23/2008 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2008 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2008"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","
ABSTRACT
Transdifferentiation has become a common claim for somatic stem cells, yet how this is accomplished has not
been well investigated. Although much evidence exists that somatic stem cells can change their protein
phenotype, it is not clear what mechanisms are involved, and whether the stem cells actually change their
function and maintain this change. To investigate the mechanisms of transdifferentiation, we propose to use
two cell types with distinct characteristics and functions: the epidermal stem cell (EpiSC) and the B
lymphocyte. EpiSCs express the intermediate filaments keratins 5 and 14 and form sheets of cells connected
by adherens and desmosomal junctions. B lymphocytes, in contrast, do not express keratin intermediate
filaments. They express a defined set of cell surface proteins with well-studied kinetics of expression. In order
for a B lymphocyte to produce a specific immunoglobulin, it must incur a permanent genetic change. This
involves deletion and rearrangement of VDJ segments in their immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. This
rearrangement is mediated by the RAG1 and RAG2 recombinase enzymes, and by the Pax5-encoded
transcription factor BSAP (B cell specific activator protein). EpiSCs do not exhibit VDJ rearrangement; express
the RAG1, RAG2, or Pax5 gene; or produce immunoglobulin. Our preliminary data suggest that EpiSCs can be
directed to express the B lymphocyte cell markers and genes, and show rearrangement of VDJ segments. We
hypothesize that EpiSCs are developmentally flexible, i.e. that they can be directed to produce cells of
alternate lineages. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1, we propose to direct EpiSCs (marked with ¿gal) to
transdifferentiate into B lymphocytes. We will verify that individual EpiSCs did transdifferentiate by detection of
B Cell surface markers and recombinase enzyme genes, and by PCR analysis for VDJ rearrangement in ¿gal-
expressing cells. Since permanency of the transdifferentiation event is important for future therapy, we will test
whether or not EpiSCs that alter their cell lineage remain transdifferentiated when removed from the B cell
inductive environment. In Aim 2, we will attempt to determine the mechanism(s) by which individual EpiSCs
transdifferentiate. Our preliminary findings indicate that EpiSCs require direct contact with the S17 stromal cells
in order to transdifferentiate. We hypothesize that S17 cells induce EpiSCs to alter their lineage via receptor-
ligand interaction(s). We will test this hypothesis by examining the membranes of EpiSCs, before and during
co-culture with S17 cells, for the expression of candidate receptor-ligand pairs. Since the skin is the largest

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCa) is the leading cancer diagnosed and the second cause of cancer death in American men. Currently, therapeutic strategies for the treatment of hormone-independent metastatic PCa are very limited. The long-term goal of our competitive renewal application is to determine whether and how transforming growth factor beta (TGF2) signaling pathway can be targeted for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to inhibit PCa growth and metastasis in preclinical animal models. In our preliminary studies, we found that systemic administration of various TGF2 antagonists inhibited the growth and angiogenesis of xenograft prostate tumors and metastasis of orthotopic prostate tumors. The inhibition of prostate tumor progression by TGF2 antagonists was in part due to the blockade of TGF2 signaling in tumor-associated stromal cells because partial blockade of TGF2 signaling by the expression of a dominant-negative receptor in prostate stromal cells significantly attenuated their tumor-promoting activity. Thus, our central hypothesis in the competitive renewal application is that blockade of TGF2 signaling in prostate stromal cells may be developed as a novel strategy to inhibit PCa growth and metastasis. In our specific aim 1, we will employ a tumor and stromal cell co-transplantation system to determine the role of TGF2 signaling in prostate stromal cells in the regulation of tumor-stroma crosstalk and tumor progression. During the past funding cycle, we developed a novel TGF2-binding protein that can act as a pan-TGF2 antagonist. We have also developed a novel androgen-receptor positive human PCa cell line that induces osteoblastic bone metastasis when inoculated intracardiacally in mice. In our specific aim 2, we will compare the efficacy of the novel pan-TGF2 binding protein with that of a small TGF2 type I receptor kinase inhibitor in the inhibition of growth and metastasis of the novel PCa cell line as well as other PCa cells in xenograft and orthotopic PCa models and the spontaneous PCa model of TRAMP mice. In the specific aim 3, we will test the novel hypothesis that the combination of a TGF2 antagonist and a chemotherapeutic drug will produce a synergistic inhibitory effect on PCa growth and metastasis in xenograft and orthotopic PCa models. Our proposed research will reveal whether targeting TGF2 signaling in tumor-associated stromal cells is feasible as a novel therapeutic approach to inhibit PCa growth and metastasis in a preclinical setting. The knowledge gained from our research may lay the foundation for clinical trials with TGF2 antagonist alone or in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic PCa. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer progression is associated with over-production of transforming growth factor beta (TGF2) and our preliminary studies have shown that TGF2 can drive hormone-independent prostate cancer progression and metastasis. Our proposed research will determine whether systemic treatment with TGF2 antagonists is of therapeutic potential for the inhibition of prostate tumor growth and bone metastasis in mouse models of prostate cancer. The knowledge gained from our research may lay the foundation for clinical trials with TGF2 antagonist alone or in combination with a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic PCa.

Component 4 will explore the mechanistic underpinnings of PTPN11's role in valve formation. The objective is to mechanistically dissect the cardiac-autonomous pathologies of Noonan syndrome. Our immediate goals are to carry out comprehensive studies using inducible, cardiac-specific expression of both the normal and mutated forms of the tyrosine phosphatase, SHP-2 in the different cardiac cell populations. These studies will be complemented by an inducible, cardiac-specific gene ablation of PTPN11 in order to discern protein function at different developmental times. SPECIFIC AIM 1 will explore the cardiomyocyte autonomous effects of SHP-2 expression in order to dissect the primary and secondary effects on hypertrophy and valve dysfunction. Wild type (WT) and mutated protein will be expressed only in the cardiomyocyte population via transgenesis. The hypothesis is that
expression of the Noonan mutation SHP-29(Gln79Arg), will result in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. SPECIFIC AIM 2 will carry out the complementary studies in the relevant non-cardiomyocyte populations to define the role that the SHP-2 mutation plays during cardiac cushion formation and development of the outflow tract. Both the WT and mutated protein will be expressed during development in the endothelial population only. SPECIFIC AIM 3 will explore loss of function of the normal protein by carrying out art inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific knockout using the MerCreMer system developed in our Division.

loss of function will differ radically depending upon the developmental time and in this manner the role of SHP-2 in controlling normal cellular processes in the heart can be explored. SPECIFIC AIM 4 will explore the signaling pathways downstream of SHP-2 in cardiomyocytes.

In Alzheimer disease (AD) beta-amyloid (AB) deposition in the cerebrovasculature is common and there is
increasing recognition that dysfunction in the BBB plays a critical role in many neurodegenerative diseases,
including AD. The focus of this project is on the hypothesis that oligomer forms of AB activate CD-14-toll-like
receptor 4 on the endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the BBB. The resulting
inflammatory response contributes to the deposition of fibrillar AB and induces a cerebrovascular inflammatory
cascade that encompasses adjacent perivascular macrophages and astrocytes. The resulting chronic expression of
proinflammatory cytokines, increases inflammatory cell adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, and attenuates
trophic factor receptor-mediated signaling in the neurovascular unit. Moreover, because of the chronic exposure
to AB oligomers and the subsequent deposition of fibrillar AB in vascular elements, these cells remain in a
""primed state"" ready to be further activated. A secondary hypothesis is that chronic systemic inflammation
exacerbates the inflammatory state of the cerebrovascular system. The role of oligomeric forms of AB in
inflammation and degeneration in the cerebrovasculature remains largely unknown due to the lack of suitable
animal models to investigate the pathological lesions associated with vascular deposition of AB. We will utilize
APP2576 and Tg-SwDI mice because collectively they develop the broad spectrum of cerebrovascular pathology
that are found in AD. Aim 1: Do oligomeric forms of AB correlate with the onset of inflammation in the
cerebrovasculature in AD, Down Syndrome (DS), and APP/Tg mice? Aim 2: Do oligomeric forms of AB
activate the CD14-TLR4 receptor complex? Do oligomeric forms of AB activate ECs and VSMCs? Do
oligomeric forms of AB inhibit growth factor signaling in ECs and VSMCs? Aim 3: Does chronic systemic
inflammation exacerbate cerebrovascular deposition of oligomeric AB and increase cerebrovascular inflammation?
Aim 4: Therapeutic Strategies: Can anti-inflammatory approaches attenuate the inflammatory-induced adverse
events in the cerebrovasculature in APP/Tg mice? Can transfected mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) expressing a
single chain anti-AB antibody attenuate AB oligomer-mediated cerebrovascular inflammation and degeneration?"," ",

genes, E-cadherin and the secreted semaphorin, SEMA3F. We originally identified the SEMA3F gene and
reported that its downregulation in patient samples correlates with advanced-stage disease. SEMA3F
potently inhibits tumor cells in vitro and in vivo, and has additional anti-angiogenic effects on endothelial
cells, where NRPs function as co-receptors for VEGF. Recently, we found that SEMA3F causes
downregulation of activated avp3 integrin in tumor cells with loss of phospho-ERK, AKT and STATS, and
inhibitory effects on HIF and VEGF. This results, at least in part, from inhibition of integrin-linked kinase and
SRC. SEMA3F is a large molecule, which presently limits its therapeutic potential, However, based on our
knowledge of semaphorin signaling, the use of small molecule and antibody inhibitors should allow
mimicking of the SEMA3F effect.
Downregulation of E-cadherin and SEMA3F occurs most commonly by silencing from transcriptional
repressers, particularly ZEB1 and Snail. The molecular changes induced by transcriptional repressers are
responsible for the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which underlies the invasive / metastatic nature
of many epithelial cancers. We've shown that E-cadherin loss correlates with poor outcome in lung cancer
patients. Not only is ZEB1 responsible for E-cadherin loss, but it also suppresses SEMA3F, and confers
resistance to EGFR inhibitors. This work has resulted in two ongoing lung cancer trials of erlotinib plus the
HDAC inhibitor, SAHA (Vorinostat), and erlotinib plus celecoxib.
Our current studies are focused on: 1) recapitulating the effects of SEMA3F by small molecules and
antibodies with the goal of developing an effective therapeutic strategy, 2) identifying new targets of ZEB and
Snail that contribute to the pathogenesis / progression of lung cancer and resistance to EGFR inhibitors and,
3) identifying the timing and frequency of EMT during lung cancer development, its relationship to other
signal pathways (including SEMA3F) and, importantly, its clinical relevance in human lung cancers and premalignant
lesions. We will also test the hypothesis that pre-malignant lesions with EMT are more likely to
develop cancer or more aggressive tumors. If confirmed, these lesions may be responsive to treatment with
HDAC inhibitors. The translational goals of Project 1 are highlighted by the use of preclinical data to design
ongoing clinical trials with SPORE biomarker support, and plans for a new clinical trial also supported by
SPORE biomarkers."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Autocrine growth factor signaling, often through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), is a hallmark of cancer cells. While EGF receptors (EGFRs) and the EGF family of ligands were thought to constitute a dominant autocrine pathway in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), only 10-20% of patients exhibit a clinical response to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), gefitinib and erlotinib. Thus, consistent with the known heterogeneity of NSCLC, EGFR is likely not the only RTK mediating autocrine growth in lung cancer. Importantly, we show that fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) are frequently co-expressed in NSCLC. Moreover, FGF2 shRNAs, dominant-negative FGFR1 and a FGFR TKI (RO4383596) selectively reduce growth of NSCLC cell lines that co-express FGF2 and FGFRs. By contrast, cell lines lacking FGF2 expression are resistant to RO4383596 and sensitive to gefitinib. Other NSCLC cells exhibit an additive response to combinations of FGFR and EGFR TKIs, implying dual EGFR and FGFR autocrine inputs. Finally, our preliminary data support a dominant role for FGFR and EGFR loops in the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a program critical to tumor progression and metastasis. Together, our findings support a hypothesis that FGF2 and FGFRs comprise an autocrine pathway that functions in NSCLC as an auxiliary to EGFR autocrine loops to drive an EMT program. To test this hypothesis, we will complete these specific aims. Aim 1: Define whether FGF2 and FGFR co-expression contributes to NSCLC cell transformed growth. Aim 2: Test the role of FGFR and EGFR autocrine signaling through the ERK MAP kinases in the regulation of EMT in NSCLC. Aim 3: Define when FGFR autocrine loops arise during human lung cancer progression and explore the association of FGF2 and FGFR co-expression with resistance to EGFR TKIs in patients. Growth factor receptors mediating transformed growth of specific tumors represent attractive therapeutic targets. In NSCLC, EGFR inhibitors have already been deployed, but with only limited success. Our preliminary studies indicate that many NSCLC cells employ FGFR autocrine signaling, either alone or in combination with EGFR signaling, as evidenced by additive inhibition of transformed growth by FGFR and EGFR inhibitors. Therefore, establishing FGF2 and specific FGFRs as components of a co-dominant autocrine signal pathway in NSCLC represents a significant problem with a high potential for impact on lung cancer treatment.

Many patients initially respond to pre-operative neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and experience better long-term survival, but response assessment is difficult, and delayed until tumor resection. Sarcoma neoadjuvant chemotherapy is based on the use of anthracyclines in combination with other active drugs such as ifosphamide and cis-platin. Our objective in this new project is to define early response patterns in pre-operative chemotherapy using PET imaging methods with specific tracers designed to assess important processes in sarcoma treatment resistance: tumor proliferation, hypoxic volume, and activity of the p-glycoprotein
(P-gp) pump as factors in drug resistance. Imaging data from these studies will also be
analyzed for ability to predict patient outcome. Sarcomas are notoriously hypoxic, which confers significant treatment resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy regimens. They also have variable levels of P-gp pump activity which is a mechanism that can increase drug effiux from tumor and reduce therapeutic effectiveness. We will use [11C]thymidine as a specific agent to quantitate tumor cell proliferation as a sensitive and specific measure of response prior to initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, after one cycle of treatment (the first of four cycles given pre-operatively), and again prior to resection. Specifically, we will identify early changes in tumor proliferation as evidence of response. Building on our previous experience imaging
sarcomas with [18F]fluoromisonidazole, we will quantitate the tumor hypoxic volume prior to treatment and correlate image derived data will tissue based laboratory assays of specific markers that relate to hypoxia, such as HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression. A new imaging agent for the P-gp pump drug efflux, [11C]verapamil, will also be used in this study. Patients will be imaged with [11C]verapamil at the same imaging times as proposed for [11C]thymidine, to quantitate levels of P-gp pump activity. Surgical samples from patient tumors in this project will be analyzed by gene microarray analysis for gene clustering patterns relevant to the processes of cell proliferation control, tissue hypoxia response, and P-gp pump activity. In this series of
proposed studies, we will make critical quantitative PET derived imaging observations on specific aspects of sarcoma biology to identify early response of the tumor to treatment, mechanisms of treatment resistance, and the ability to predict patient outcome."," ",

Congenital and acquired corneal diseases are exemplified by altered genetic functions. To better treat corneal diseases, it is imperative to gain insights of gene functions during embryonic development and pathogenesis in adults. To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of corneal epithelial differentiation and wound healing, a mouse line expressing Cre recombinase by the corneal epithelium has been prepared by knock-in the phage Cre gene into the Krt12 allele via gene targeting techniques. Additional mouse lines using Cre/IoxP system are prepared from the Krt12Cre knock-in mice for corneal epithelium-specific expression of green fluorescent protein, conditional ablations of Jun and Fos in compound floxed transgenic mice, Krt12Cre/Cre-RosaSF, Krt12Cre/Cre-Junf/f (homozygous floxed Jun) and Krt12Cre/Cre-Fosf/f, respectively. Aim 1 is to determine differentiation and wound healing of corneal epithelium: Aim 1a is to examine the hypothesis that one of the two Krt12 alleles is preferentially used by individual corneal epithelial cells, Aim 1b is to determine the kinetics of differentiation during embryonic development and post natal growth of cornea, Aim 1c tests the hypothesis that corneal TAC (transit amplifying cells) cells of young mice are stem cell-like and of stem cell characteristics. To examine roles of
AP-1 transcription factors on homeostasis of corneal epithelium and healing of corneal epithelium
debridement, conditional Jun and Fos knockout mice (Krt12Cre/Cre-Junf/f and  Krt12Cre/Cre-Fosf/f) are prepared. Aim 2 is to determine roles of Jun on cornea-type epithelium differentiation and wound healing. Corneas of adult Krt12Cre/Cre-Junf/f mice will be subject to immunohistochemistry, northern and in situ hybridization, to determine the roles of Jun on homeostasis of corneal epithelium. The AP-1 dimers will be determined by immune precipitation with anti-Fos antibodies and western blot with anti-Jun family member. The nuclear and cytosol proteins isolated from injured and un-injured Krt12Cre/Cre-Junf/f and Krt12+/+-Junf/f
(control) corneas will be subject to proteomic analysis using 2-dimensional High Performance Liquid Electrophoresis (2D-HPLE). Aim 3 is to examine roles of Fos on corneal-type epithelium differentiation and corneal wound healing as described in Aim 2.","432167",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In healthy individuals, exposure to radiation doses as low as 0.5 Gy can lead to detectable changes in circulating lymphocyte counts and doses of 6 Gy can be fatal even with aggressive treatment. Radiation doses of 2 Gy or more can lead to acute radiation syndrome (ARS) but would not be considered life threatening unless that exposure occurred with simultaneous physical trauma or burns. In many terrorist radiation exposure scenarios, injury will likely involve radiation exposure and additional, complicating trauma and or burns. Such combined injuries leads to increased mortality. We hypothesize that radiation acutely modifies the normal wound healing response through damage of local skin stem cells and thus interfering with the host's ability to repair the damaged area. This lack of repair contributes to local chronic inflammatory responses adding to the delayed healing. In order to test this hypothesis, the initial component of this R21 will be to establish the model and the biological monitoring of impact of combined injuries with two specific aims: 1. Define the alterations in the kinetics of wound regeneration following radiation exposure in the MRL mouse and, 2. Define alterations in the molecular and cellular wound regeneration responses following radiation exposure. Once the model is established, we will then proceed in the following years to test the hypothesis and the efficacy of different cellular therapies with the following aims: 1. Determine the effects of radiation on wound healing response of local skin stem cells and transplanted stem cells. 2. Characterize the mechanism through which the transplantation of cellular products accelerates the in vivo recovery from combined radiation injury. We will draw on our broad experience in hematopoietic cell therapy to assess the efficacy of three novel approaches: endothelial progenitors, cord blood cells or mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. These cellular populations have been previously shown to be highly effective in rescuing mice from lethal doses of radiation, primarily through the rescue of the hematopoietic syndrome. In this aim we will assess the direct injection of these cellular fractions into the site of the injured skin as well as intravenous injection. People can tolerate low doses of radiation. However if the radiation is combined with another injury such as a wound, individuals can die. For example, following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or the Chernobyl accident, thermal injury (burns) and trauma concurrent with radiation exposure were a significant medical finding. We hypothesize that radiation acutely modifies the normal wound healing response through damage of local skin stem cells and thus interfering with the host's ability to repair the damaged area. We will test different cell therapies to improve the outcomes in a mouse model.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objectives are to determine the mechanisms of action of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which stimulates vital biological processes such as chondrogenesis, angiogenesis and matrigenesis. CTGF, a 38kDa protein comprising 4 structural modules (modules 1-4), drives cell differentiation during embryogenesis, and tissue remodeling during development, wound healing and placentation. CTGF-null mice exhibit lethal angiogenic and skeletal defects. Excessive CTGF production is a hallmark of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, which are the 9th leading cause of death in the West. CTGF contributes to liver pathogenesis because it promotes adhesion, chemotaxis, proliferation and collagen production in hepatic stellate cells (HSC), a major fibrogenic cell type. This is achieved via binding between CTGF and cell surface receptors such as integrins and low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP). Chronic liver fibrosis, such as that caused by excessive alcohol consumption, may require a sustained interaction between CTGF and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), the latter of which is also strongly implicated in liver fibrosis and is a stimulus for CTGF production. Our hypothesis is that CTGF-mediated HSC fibrogenesis is driven through the ability of CTGF to interact with specific integrin subtypes or LRP, downstream of TGF-b- or ethanol-induced CTGF production. The Specific Aims to test this hypothesis are: 1. Establish the integrin avb3-dependency of CTGF-mediated fibrogenesis and survival in HSC in vitro; 2. Establish the regulation of HSC function by interactions between LRP or integrin a6b1 and module 3 of CTGF 3. Establish the mechanisms of ethanol-mediated CTGF regulation in HSC. Through the proposed studies, we will establish the underlying mechanisms of CTGF-induced fibrogenic pathways in HSC. In the USA, 5.5 million people suffer from chronic liver disease or cirrhosis yet fibrotic disease represents one of the largest groups of disorders for which there is no effective therapy, and thus represents a major unsolved medical challenge. Our studies will give a new lead to the development of novel anti-fibrotic treatments by identifying critical points of intervention in pathways of CTGF action.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is one of the most devastating diseases with great morbidity and mortality, and the number of patients is on the rise worldwide. This competitive renewal application is a continuation of our long-term efforts to develop rational strategies for therapeutic intervention of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) that progress to ESRD. Despite diverse primary etiologies, the pathogenesis of CKD is characterized by chronic inflammatory infiltration and relentless accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) leading to widespread tissue fibrosis. Thus, developing a scheme to inhibit inflammation and fibrosis may be a key strategy for the treatment of CKD. Studies in previous project period of this application suggest that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is potent anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory factor that prevents the onset and progression of CKD in animal models. In this continuation application, we propose to investigate the molecular mechanism by which HGF elicits its beneficial actions. The central hypotheses to be tested are that: 1) HGF inhibits renal fibrosis by antagonizing the fibrogenic action of TGF-¿/Smad signaling; 2) HGF suppresses renal inflammation by blocking pro-inflammatory NF-kB signaling; and 3) HGF interacts synergistically with TGF-¿1 to suppress renal inflammation. These hypotheses will be addressed by three specific aims at the whole animal, the cellular, the signal transduction and molecular levels, respectively. Aim 1 is designed to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying HGF induction of SnoN expression in tubular epithelial cells and to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SnoN gene transfer for chronic kidney fibrosis in vivo. Aim 2 is to understand the mechanism underlying HGF blockade of renal inflammation and NF-kB signaling and investigate the interplay between HGF and TGF-¿1 leading to synergistic inhibition of renal inflammation. Aim 3 is to evaluate the role of HGF/c-met signaling in mediating the anti-fibrotic action of peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor-y. These studies will provide fundamental and important insights into understanding the mechanism underlying the therapeutic efficacy of HGF for CKD. Ultimately, these studies may lead to development of novel strategies to alter the course of human kidney disease by manipulating the activity of HGF signaling system.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major complications of diabetes, where cellular dysfunctions induced by hyperglycemia have certain degree of similarities in different compartments of the kidney, i.e., glomerular vs tubulo-interstitial or vascular. The cells affected may be derived from epithelial or mesenchymal progenitors; and at times hyperglycemia may induce a phenotypic change with epithelial-mesenchymal transformation. In target cells the high glucose activates various intracellular pathways that are similar except for minor variations. These pathways have been mainly studied in various cell types of the glomerulus, while the information available in the literature for the tubular compartment is limited. Intriguingly, our suppression subtraction analyses of kidneys of ""neonatal"" diabetic mice indicate that the majority of the differentially up- regulated genes are expressed in the renal tubules, e.g., GTP binding protein Rap1b, guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac1 and ubiquitin fusion protein UbA52 and etc. The Rap1b was found to exert downstream effects leading to up-regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Interestingly, the co- expressed Epac1 happens to positively regulate the Rap1b activity. A recently described negative regulator of Rap1b is Cbl, a proto-oncogene. All the three molecules are modulated by high glucose ambience. Conceivably, both Cbl and Epac1 exert their effects on Rap1b to strike a balance in its activity to dampen the complications of diabetes related to ECM biology. To attest to this contention various experiments are proposed under the following specific aims: I. Modulation of Rap1b, Cbl and Epac1 expression in animal models of diabetes will be investigated and correlated with the disease activity. Attempts will be made to gauge the activity of Rap1b on the expression of tubulo-interstitial ECM proteins. II. Effect of high glucose ambience on their expression will be investigated in cell culture systems. Efforts will be devoted to tease out the modulation of Rap1b by Cbl/Epac1 under high glucose by employing various agonists, inhibitors, dominant constructs & shRNA/siRNA oligos. III. Mechanism(s) by which high glucose activate, directly or indirectly, Cbl and Epac1, will be investigated by carrying out promoter analysis, gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Role of glycative, oxidant/antioxidant and osmotic stresses in their activation will be investigated. IV. Other molecules that could activate Rap1b will be identified by using co-immuno- precipitation procedures and yeast-two-hybrid systems. V. Since Epac1 is up-regulated in the ""neonatal"" diabetic mice and exhibits differential expression during development, its modulation of nephrogenesis under high glucose ambience will be investigated. It is hoped that these studies would enhance our understanding of the ""Renal Tubulo-interstitial ECM Pathobiology"" relevant to diabetic nephropathy.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) is a major transcription factor which regulates the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines. The activation of NFkB plays a critical role in the initiation and development of inflammatory bone diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, periodontitis and osteoporosis. It has long been known that inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibit bone formation and impair osteoblastic functions in addition to promoting bone resorption. Although significant progress has been made in the understanding of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, little is known about how inflammatory mediators exhibit their mode of action in bone formation. In this application, we hypothesize that NFkB, in addition to its immune function, plays a critical role in the inhibition of osteoblast function and bone formation in inflammatory bone diseases. To test our hypothesis, we established a mesenchymal cell model in which osteogenic differentiation could be inhibited by TNF. Using this model, we found that the inhibition of NFkB enhanced osteogenic differentiation induced by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in vitro. To validate our findings in vivo, we generated two strains of transgenic mice which specifically expressed the NFkB inhibitor in osteoblasts. Our preliminary studies found that the inhibition of NFkB increased bone formation in vivo. To fully understand the molecular mechanisms by which inflammatory mediators inhibit bone formation, we propose the following three aims. Aim 1 is to examine whether the inhibition of endogenous NFkB activities affects osteogenic differentiation and determine whether NFkB plays a critical role in the TNF/IL-1 inhibition of osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Aim 2 is to determine whether NFkB negatively regulates postnatal bone formation in vivo by inhibiting osteoblast functions. Aim 3 is to explore whether the inhibition of NFkB in osteoblasts prohibits bone loss induced by osteoporosis and inflammatory cytokines in vivo. Aim 4 is to explore how NFkB inhibits osteoblast function and bone formation. These in vitro and in vivo approaches will provide new insights into the molecular regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Additionally, in the realm of bone tissue regeneration, the defected or injured tissues may be inflamed with an abnormal expression of inflammatory mediators. Thus, to obtain successful bone regeneration, it is important to overcome the inflammation-mediated inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. Taken together, novel results from our studies may have important implications in developing new strategies to inhibit and prevent bone loss caused by inflammatory mediators in a variety of human bone disorders.

 t infects, usually asymptomatically, over one half of the world's human population. However 15% of
those infected will develop ulcer disease or gastric cancer. Our proposed research focuses on a single
bacterial determinant, CagA, an effector protein translocated by a bacterial secretory apparatus into
gastric epithelial cells. CagA is arguably the most important virulence determinant of this microbe, since
ts presence is clearly correlated with ulcer disease and gastric malignancy, and its effects on host cell
biology place it at the crux between microbial pathogenesis and cancer biology. We propose to address
three fundamental questions related to how the initial encounter between the H. pylori CagA protein
works to the advantage of the microorganism and to the detriment of the host. First, what are the
molecular mechanisms by which CagA perturbs host epithelial cell biology? Second, what is the role of
CagA for H. pylori survival in close association with the host cell surface? And finally, what are the in-
vivo consequences of CagA delivery to the gastric mucosa in an animal model? Our previous research
directs us to a clear focus on the interaction of the CagA protein and the host proteins of the apical
junctional complex, a domain of the cell that controls cell polarity, provides the barrier function of the
mucosa, and regulates the differentiation, growth and wound healing capacities of epithelia. CagA also
triggers one, or possibly more, receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. We predict that these are
not unrelated functions, but rather that CagA usurps an intrinsic link between growth factor receptor
signaling and the apical junctions. We have also hypothesized that H. pylori utilizes CagA to modify the
host cell surface for colonization purposes, recruiting specific host proteins to the sites of bacterial
attachment, disrupting cell polarity, and opening the epithelial junctions. We have proposed a
hypothesis of CagA action that we believe can be tested both in-vitro and in-vivo. We have developed
novel microscopic tools and an experimentally tractable model of chronic infection of polarized cells in
culture to examine the cell biology of the CagA-host cell interaction. Moreover, we will also make
extensive use of direct biochemical fractionation and transcriptional analysis to dissect the role of CagA
at a molecular level. Finally we propose testing the observations we have gathered from precise in-vitro
analysis in the more complex, but more relevant environment of the stomach in an animal host.","393827",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
  
Although steroids are highly effective in the control of asthma, some patients fail to respond even to high doses. Steroid resistance is a veritable health challenge due to the absence of therapeutic alternatives and a financial burden as steroid-resistant patients account for more than 50% of asthma related healthcare costs. The candidate's current research at the University of Pennsylvania focuses in studying steroid resistance in airway smooth muscle (ASM), a tissue that is relevant for lung diseases. The short term goal of the studies performed currently and during the mentored phase of this award (K99) is to delineate the molecular mechanisms that underlay the diminished efficacy of steroids. This study will be pursued during the independent phase of this award (R00) with the ultimate objective to develop new therapeutic options to treat steroid-resistant asthmatics. The candidate's long term goal is to establish his own independent research program and submit an R01 application. The central hypothesis of this proposal is novel and states that pro-asthmatic cytokines impair steroid function in ASM cells through the coordinated activation of three pathways: (i) GR beta, a steroid receptor beta isoform that can act as an inhibitor of GC actions (will be addressed in Aim 1), (ii) IRF-1, a transcription factor that regulates many inflammatory genes (will be addressed in Aim 2), and (iii) Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), shown to act as an inhibitor of steroid actions in different cell lines (will be addressed in Aim 3). All three Aims of the present proposal will rely on multiple complementary approaches such as siRNA technology, transfection of reporter vectors as well as over-expression of constitutively active or dominant negative proteins, co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization techniques, chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays. Subsequently, this award will dramatically enhance the candidate's technical skills and will broaden his expertise in molecular pharmacology and cell biology. We believe that our proposal is relevant to public health since improving the knowledge about the factors that lead to steroid resistance will help design new therapeutic agents or alternatives to treat steroid-resistant asthmatics.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, advanced glycation end products (AGE), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have emerged as important mediators of diabetes-induced tissue injury. However, the precise cellular targets and molecular mechanisms by which these mediators cause cellular injury in the kidney remain poorly defined.  
Both, glomerular (podocytes) and tubular epithelial cells are now emerging as important targets for diabetes-induced injury in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Thus, podocyte depletion has been described recently in humans with type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) diabetes, and is considered a strong predictor for the development of proteinuria. In addition, tubular epithelial apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may underlie the initiation of tubulointerstitial progression of DN.   
We present preliminary results that provide a compelling rationale to focus our research program on investigating the emerging role and mechanisms of epithelial cell injury in DN. Specifically, we will test two novel hypotheses: 1. The peroxisomal membrane proteins Mpv17l and/or Mpv17 are essential regulators of antioxidant defenses in glomerular podocytes and protect against diabetes-induced podocyte apoptosis and podocyte depletion (Bottinger, Mount Sinai); and 2. CD36 scavenger receptor for AGE and/or FFA is an essential mediator of AGE and/or FFA-induced tubular epithelial injury/apoptosis and tubulointerstitial progression of DN (Susztak, AECOM).  
The Specific Aims of this proposal are to test:  
1. whether peroxisomal membrane proteins regulate antioxidant defense mechanisms in podocytes, and protect against ROS-mediated podocyte injury/apoptosis induced by diabetes  
2. whether Mpv17-deficiency accelerates and increases podocyte apoptosis and depletion leading to progressive glomerulosclerosis and/or nodules in diabetic mouse models   
3. which CD36-dependent intracellular pathways signal AGE and FFA induced tubular epithelial injury/apoptosis   
4. whether proximal tubular overexpression of AGE binding proteins CD36 and RAGE leads to increased tubular epithelial injury/apoptosis and tubulointerstitial progression of DN in mice

Shh acts as a       mitogen and cell survival factor in many adult processes during normal tissure renewal and in       many types of cancer, but acts as a morphogen in several developmental contexts. Whether and       how the mitogenic role of Shh is integrated with the morphogenetic role in developmental       contexts is still poorly understood. In the limb, Shh regulates both digit number and identity       of different digits (A-to-P, thumb to pinky). Shh is thought to act as a morphogen forming a       gradient along the limb AP axis, with higher concentrations specifying more posterior digit       types. We have determined the time-requirements for Shh function in limb (using a       tamoxifen-regulated Cre to remove Shh at different times in mice). To perform this analysis,       we generated and characterized a conditional Cre recombinase line selectively expressed in       early limb mesoderm, neural crest, gut and tailbud. This line provides an excellent tool       available to the scientific community to illuminate different temporal roles of key       developmental regulators in several important developmental models using mouse mutants, as       well as for genetic lieage tracing studies in mice. We found that Shh has separable, dual       functions in limb: an early transient role controlling digit pattern, and an ongoing role       regulating cell mass (survival and proliferation) that determines the total digit number. We       find an invariant order of digit loss that is not consistent with predictions from current       morphogen gradient models. The order of digit loss correlates inversely with the order in       which digit primordia first form, and the phenotype severity at different times correlates       with degree of apoptosis and decrease in mitotic index. Our results suggest that Shh regulates       digit pattern only very early and transiently but is required over an extended time mainly to       ensure cell survival and/or proliferation. If the limb bud has fewer cells, fewer digit       primordia can form but those that do form are normal. The Gli3 transcription factor is the       major downstream effector of Shh signaling in the nucleus. In collaborative studies with Dr.       Alex Joyner (Sloan Kettering Inst.), the time-requirements for Gli3 function have also been       analyzed and the results of this study support our model, also suggesting that the requirement       for Shh in growth to expand digit numbers requires a much more prolonged time than the       requirement for patterning. To test this model for Shh function, we will determine if       restoring survival and/or proliferation in mutant embryos after later-stage Shh deletion can       rescue digit formation. To rescue cell survival, the compound mutant for the pro-apoptotic       Bcl2 family members Bax/Bak (which play roles in normal interdigital apoptosis) will be       introduced to inactivate the intrinsic death pathway. Myc has been identified as a direct       target of Hedgehog signaling that regulates proliferation in several systems. To attempt       rescue of proliferation, we will use a RosaMycER transgene (from Dr. Gerard Evan) to provide a       proliferative impulse whose timing, duration and level of action can be closely regulated by       tamoxifen. Having found that Shh loss in limb causes G1-arrest, in parallel we will analyze       how Shh regulates the cell cycle. Understanding the proliferative and anti-apoptotic actions       of Shh may provide a reference for deciphering Shh roles in cancer. To learn how proliferation       and recruitment of mesenchymal cells relate to the alternating formation of condensations, and       integrate our results with other work on Shh function, we are developing tools to image very       early condensations, and to trace cell lineage genetically. These tools will help unravel how       the observed alternating A-P order of condensation is regulated, and whether this sequence is       evolutionarily conserved among different vertebrates. We are also analyzing whether another       hedgehog signal (Indian Hedgehog, Ihh), produced later when cartilage begins to form, plays       any role in determining the final morphology or identity of each digit together with Shh. We       will assess the time requirements for all hedgehog ligands during early limb development by       removing an essential pathway component (smoothened, smo) downstream of signal-receptor       interaction at different times using a conditional mutant allele.","297081",

Novel cell surface serine proteases in epidermal development, repair, and malignancy (33% effort) 
A newly defined syndrome, autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis (ARIH), recently was linked to mutation in the ST14 gene leading to a G827R substitution in the protease matriptase.  The clinical manifestations of ARIH include tooth defects, corneal opacity with photophobia, epidermal abnormalities, and hypotrichosis. In collaboration with Benjamin Cravatt, The Scripps Institute, and Julia Segre NHGRI, we characterized the activity of G827R matriptase. The mutated protease retained the ability to incorporate fluorophosphonate probes, showing that some serine hydrolytic activity was retained in the mutant protein.  However, activity of G827R towards a variety of peptide and natural substrates was undetectable.  To further investigate the link between ARIH and reduced matriptase activity, we generated a mouse strain that displays a one-hundred-fold reduction in epidermal matriptase mRNA. Interestingly, the phenotype of these ST14 hypomorphic mice recapitulates key features of human ARIH.  These include: a) Abnormal enamel surfaces of incisors and molars.  b) Hypotrichosis with absence of erupted whiskers in neonates, sparse fur, and curly and thin whiskers. c) Impaired epidermal barrier function and desquamation, leading to marked retention and hyperproliferative ichthyosis, and outwardly wrinkled and scaly epidermis.  d) Impaired proteolytic processing of the downstream matriptase targets, pro-prostasin and profilaggrin. These studies strongly indicate that reduced activity of a matriptase-prostasin proteolytic cascade is the etiological origin of human ARIH and provides an important mouse model for the exploration of matriptase function in ARIH, as well as other physiological and pathological processes. 
The transmembrane Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator (HAI)-1 is near-ubiquitously co-expressed with matriptase in both embryonic and adult epithelia, and that matriptase inhibition by HAI-1 is essential for preserving epithelial integrity and to complete mouse embryogenesis. To gain insights into the biochemistry of this critical transmembrane serine protease inhibitor, in a collaboration with Lotte Vogel, University of Copenhagen, we determined the biosynthesis and cellular localization of HAI-1 in polarized epithelial cells in culture.  The study revealed that HAI-1 has a complex subcellular itinerary that differs from all serine protease inhibitors studied to date.  Immediately after synthesis, HAI-1 is exocytosed to the basolateral plasma membrane, where a small fraction of the inhibitor undergoes ectodomain shedding.  Residual HAI-1 subsequently recycles between the endosomal compartment and the basolateral plasma membrane, before the inhibitor is transcytosed to the apical membrane, from which it is finally cleared by endocytosis and lysosomal degradation.  This shows that HAI-1 is exposed to many cellular compartments, where the inhibitor may functionally interact with matriptase and several other potential target serine proteases within and an outside of the matriptase proteolytic cascade. 


Urokinase receptor-associated protein (uPARAP) and intracellular collagen turnover (33% effort) 
We have worked with in collaboration with Kenn Holmbeck, MMPU, CSDB, Roberto Weigert, IMTU, OPCB, and Niels Behrendt, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, to gain mechanistic insights into the uPARAP-dependent intracellular pathway of collagen degradation, with the ultimate aim of integrating this novel collagen degradation pathway into known collagen catabolic pathways. These studies have revealed that the growth of explanted primary uPARAP-deficient fibroblasts on a native fibrillar collagen matrix leads to a dramatic accumulation of large collagen fragments in the culture supernatant, compatible with the hypothesis of uPARAP being engaged in the endocytic turnover of collagen fragments that have been proteolytically liberated from collagen-rich matrices by soluble or membrane-associated collagenases.  In agreement with this notion, acid extracted soluble collagen that has been pre-cleaved by mammalian collagenases is taken up considerably faster by uPARAP-expressing cells than intact, native collagen.  Unexpectedly, however, single or combined genetic deficiencies in several mesenchymal collagenases (membrane type (MT)-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), MT3-MMP, and MMP-2) or even the pretreatment of cells with a broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor failed to markedly affect uPARAP-dependent collagen internalization.  These data suggest that uPARAP either internalizes collagen independently of pericellular/extracellular collagen pre-cleavage, or more likely, that uPARAP-dependent collagen degradation is preceded by initial collagen cleavage via a hitherto uncharacterized collagen catabolic pathway.  


Reengineered bacterial cytotoxins as antitumor and protease imaging agents (33% effort)
We have continued our long-standing collaborations with Stephen Leppla, MPS, NIAID, and Art Frankel, Scott & White, Temple, Texas, on the development of cell surface protease-activated bacterial cytotoxins as therapeutic agents for cancer.  Our previous work provided proof of concept by showing that toxins activated by proteolytic enzymes overexpressed in tumors display high tumoricidal activity and limited tissue toxicity in mouse models.  We have also demonstrated that the therapeutic index of protease-activated toxins can be further increased by making toxin variants that require sequential activation by more than one tumor-associated protease, or by combining the requirement for tumor protease activation with retargeting of toxin receptor specificity.  In an independent effort, we have recently shown that protease-activated cytotoxins can be retooled for use in non-invasive imaging of specific proteolytic activity in single living cells in culture.
We have worked with Silvio Gutkind, MCU, OPCB, on the development of a novel modified anthrax toxin that targets tumor vasculature.  To this end, we have taken advantage of previous studies that have established that angiogenic endothelium, but not quiescent endothelium, expresses cell surface MMP activity, that the response of endothelial cells to VEGF is dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEKs), and that anthrax lethal factor (LF) efficiently cleaves and inactivates MEKs when translocated to the cytoplasm during anthrax toxin intoxication.  We thus generated a reengineered anthrax toxin in which the cytoplasmic translocation of LF was mediated by a MMP-activated variant of anthrax protective antigen (PA-L1; 164RRKR167 &#8594; 164GPLGMLSQ171).  As predicted, when combined with LF, PA-L1 displayed very limited toxicity to normal tissues, due to the restricted expression of cell surface MMP activity and MEK-dependence of homeostatic tissues.  Wound healing times increased by about 50% in toxin-treated mice, compatible with anti-angiogenic activity and impairment of angiogenesis-dependent processes.  Unexpectedly, however, the novel toxin displayed greater bioavailability and lower antigenicity than wildtype toxin, as a consequence of the limited uptake and clearance of the modified toxin by normal cells.  Furthermore, PA-L1 and LF displayed potent anti-angiogenic activity, as assessed in both in vitro and in vivo assays, which translated into strong anti-tumor activity towards a diverse array of xenografted and syngrafted human and murine tumors.  All these properties taken together suggest that the novel MMP-activated anti-tumor toxin holds promise for use in cancer therapy.","1649453",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term objective of this research involves determining the mechanism whereby the mouse discs- large homolog 1 gene, Dlgh1, regulates urogenital development. DLGH1 is a scaffolding protein with multiple protein-protein interaction domains, including three PDZ domains and one SH3 domain. Dlgh1 is a homolog of the Drosophila discs-large gene, dlg, which is a founding member of the eponymous PDZ family of proteins and also of the MAGUK (membrane-associated guanylate kinase) family. Studies in Drosophila suggest that dlg is a tumor suppressor, because mutation of dlg causes overgrowth of imaginal discs. Studies in both fly and mammalian cells suggest that dlg and its homologs are also involved in establishing and/or maintaining epithelial cell polarity. We have studied mice lacking DLGH1 and found several urogenital defects, including sporadic renal agenesis, congenital hydronephrosis, and reproductive tract abnormalities. We have shown that hydronephrosis is associated with dramatic smooth muscle alignment defects; the normally circular muscle aberrantly aligns in the longitudinal direction. This greatly impairs the squeezing motion of peristalsis, such that urine is retained in the kidney. In addition, ureteric stromal cells, which normally lie between the urothelium and the smooth muscle layers and express Raldh2, are absent from Dlgh1 mutant ureters. The absence of these cells could also affect ureteric function, either directly or indirectly. Immunofluorescence studies show that DLGH1 is expressed strongly in the urothelium and weakly in other cells of the ureter. We will determine which cellular compartment must express Dlgh1 for normal smooth muscle cell alignment and for differentiation and/or migration of ureteric stromal cells using a new floxed Dlgh1 allele and appropriate Cre transgenic mice. In addition, we will generate chimeric mice to investigate whether DLGH1 acts in a non-cell autonomous fashion. Morphological and functional assessments will be performed to determine the cellular requirements for Dlgh1 expression. Next we will use genetic methods to investigate the hypothesis that the interaction of other DLGH family members with known or suspected DLGH1 binding proteins are compensating in part for the absence of DLGH1. Finally, we will use in vitro methods to define the role of DLGH1 in cell migration, polarization, and signaling. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congenital urinary tract abnormalities are a relatively common health problem in the human population and are responsible for a significant number of cases of progressive renal disease. We have generated a novel mouse model of hydronephrosis (Dlgh1-/- mice) involving the misalignment of ureteric smooth muscle, which is commonly found in human cases of urinary tract obstruction. A better understanding of the biology of DLGH1 could have important implications for understanding and perhaps for treatment or prevention of urinary tract abnormalities in humans.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths annually, with over 37,000 new cases and over 32,000 deaths estimated for 2007. Despite recent improved understanding of pancreas cancer biology, the 5-year survival remains at 4% despite multimodality therapy. The continued poor survival despite the new understanding of pancreatic cancer biology and the incorporation of novel therapies demonstrates an acute need for improvement in therapy. To this end, a patient-derived pancreatic adenocarcinoma explant xenograft model, the ""PancBank"", has been created to help develop novel therapies for pancreatic cancer. One emerging target is the non-receptor kinase, c-SRC. This protein regulates multiple cascades that impact cellular adhesion, migration and invasion, factors that when dysregulated enable tumor cells to disrupt their microenvironment, travel to distant sites and invade host tissues independent of normal regulatory signals. The result of this phenotype is metastasis, the critical mechanism by which cancer cells cause organ dysfunction and ultimately death. As with most targeted therapies, it is critically important to search for correlative biomarkers of drug efficacy in order to properly select patients. We have used novel oral Src inhibitors in the PancBank to compare sensitive and resistant human pancreas cancer explants, and have found interesting leads using gene profiling analysis and Western blotting. The next step is to explore these preliminary findings in the clinic. The goal is to complete a phase II clinical and biological study of AZD0530, an oral Src inhibitor, in gemcitabine-resistant metastatic pancreas cancer patients. This is a CTEP-approved and funded protocol run through the Phase II Consortium, and the principal investigator of this proposal wrote the protocol and serves as its national chair. Using correlative studies including pre- and post-tumor biopsies, PET scans, and PK studies, this clinical trial represents a highly unique opportunity to qualify and extend the results of the human xenograft experiments in pancreas cancer. The central hypothesis, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a subset of patients who can be identified in predictive manner with our correlative studies will derive benefit from AZD0530. These studies will identify biomarkers that can be tested in a larger phase III study in the future, and also point the way towards drug combinations with Src inhibitors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this grant is to explore what properties of pancreas cancer are associated with vulnerability, or resistance, to Src inhibitors. We will use several methods to analyze patient tumor samples from the clinical protocol NCI#7602, ""A Phase II Trial of AZD0530 in Previously Treated Metastatic Pancreas Cancer."" AZD0530 is a novel oral inhibitor of Src, which was of the first cancer-causing genes discovered several decades ago, and it is hoped the results will help guide us to better use of such drugs in the clinic.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This goal of this project is to improve the immune function of ""humanized"" mice in order to provide a better model for testing candidate vaccines for HIV/AIDS. Over the past 20 years, techniques for generating human immune function following transfer of human cells to immunodeficient mice have gradually improved. This project begins with the best of the current models, transfer of human CD34-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells to mice with genetic disruption of Rag-2 and IL-2 receptor common gamma chain genes, and systematically evaluates strategies to improve the function of the many engrafted human B lymphocytes observed in this model. The project specifically focuses on two subsets of human B cells, the B1 subset responsible for ""natural antibodies"" and the marginal zone (MZ) B2 subset responsible for antibodies to carbohydrate antigens, because we are evaluating glycoconjugate vaccines (produced by Dennis Burton and collaborators) that target carbohydrates on the envelope spike of HIV-1. Recent advances in understanding the differentiation of B1 and MZ B cells provide the rationale for supplying supporting stromal cells and differentiation factors that should enhance the survival and function of these human B cells. The deficits recognized in the current humanized mouse model, absence of human follicular dendritic cells and human T cells that are positively selected on mouse epithelial cells, will be repaired by additional cell transplants. An ""artificial lymph node"" approach that is more amenable to replacing missing supporting cells will also be used to more rapidly evaluate which cell type is critical for fully functional immune responses. This research proposal is directly responsive to RFA-AI-07-015 in that it attempts to characterize B1 and MZ B cell responses to carbohydrates that shield HIV-1 from attack by conventional antibodies targeting protein components of the envelope. Successful execution of the project specific aims will result in a humanized mouse model capable of rapidly screening multiple HIV-1 candidate vaccines for both immunogenicity and protection against HIV-1 infection. This would speed vaccine development and reduce reliance on primate challenge models. There are many challenges to developing an effective vaccine to prevent HIV/AIDS, and one way to more effectively confront these challenges is to develop a small animal model system that accurately reflects the human immune response to candidate vaccines. After many years of work, that goal seems close. This proposal will attempt to fix the few remaining problems in ""humanized mice"", and use them to test a new AIDS vaccine decorated with sugar groups from the virus.

Foundation estimates 20 million Americans (1 in 9 adults) suffer from chronic renal disease (CRD); by 2020
the estimate reaches 1 in 4. There are an increasing number of epidemiologic and animal reports that show
 range of maternal perturbations including maternal nutrient restriction (MNR) in pregnancy that impair fetal
renal development, suggesting an in utero component of predisposition to CRD. Preliminary data: Our
baboon model at 0.5 of gestation (G) shows that a 30% decrease in maternal global nutrition from 0.16 to 0.5
G (i) decreases proximal tubule density while decreasing mRNA expression of fetal renal extracellular matrix
components fibronectin, laminin, collagen IV, integrin-linked kinase, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and TGF/?;
(ii) decreases mRNA expression of fetal renal growth factors IGF, VEGF, EGF receptor (R) and PDGFR; and
(iii) alters components of the fetal renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in a fetal gender-specific manner.
Similarities in nutrition, placentation and kidney development between the baboon and humans make this
model a unique opportunity for significant primate studies of gene/environment interaction that are not
possible in humans. Hypothesis: MNR has duration of exposure and gender specific effects on fetal baboon
kidney development that are primarily mediated by decreased extracellular matrix components expression,
growth factor expression, cytokine expression and decreased nutrient sensing pathway activity. Reduced
fetal nutrient availability [1] decreases nephron length, decreases glomerular endowment and increases
glomerular size at term; [2] decreases expression of growth factors involved in vasculogenesis and
angiogenesis resulting in decreased peritubular and glomerular capillary density; and [3] impacts the intra-
renal renin-angiotensin system in a gender specific manner by increasing intra-renal 11/MHSD1 and
aromatase activity. Approach: Studies will be conducted on fresh, frozen and fixed fetal kidney at 0.33,
0.50, 0.66 and 0.90 G using: (i) histology and unbiased stereology; (ii)QRT-PCR/ISH and Western blot/IHC
for mRNA and protein expression and localization; (iii) mobility band shift assay for gene transcriptional
regulation; and (iv) growth factor activity assay in explants in Matrigel culture and isolated proximal tubule
cell 3D culture. Synergy: All three projects study the effects of MNR on the fetal baboon as mediated, at
least in part, by the IGF system peptides. Lay Description: We pass more biological milestones before we
are born than at any other time in life. Our data will develop what is know about kidney development in the
primate and demonstrate that sub-optimal conditions in utero alter the trajectory of renal development.
Clinicians will use the information to understand optimal life style and diet in pregnancy."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart cell therapy using stem cells with myogenic and angiogenic potential or cytokine induced mobilization of bone marrow cells (BMCs) to the site of injury has shown promise. Similarly, ischemic and pharmacological preconditioning has cardioprotective effects. These therapeutic modalities have been adopted to promote de novo myocardial regeneration and reversal of deleterious hemodynamic effects after myocardial infarction (MI). In order to achieve these effects the present study involves transplantation of BMCs together with skeletal myoblasts (SkMs) which will serve mainly as carries of therapeutic genes. Our main hypothesis is that preconditioning and re-programming of cells prior to transplantation would enhance their survival, engraftment and efficacy for cardiac repair. The main aims of our study are; Aim-1) Preconditioning of donor cells for their enhanced survival after transplantation. We posit that treatment of cells by preconditioning mimetics may enhance their tolerance to ischemia via stimulation of cell survival signaling. The preconditioned (PC) cells will also exhibit paracrine effects which will give enhanced host myocyte survival in the infarcted heart. Aim-2) Intramyocardial delivery of non-virally transfected SkMs overexpressing SDF-11 along with transient cytokine therapy for BMCs mobilization for improved heart function. We hypothesized that the elevated SDF-11 levels in the heart will attract circulating CXCR4+ BMCs, egress of which from BM will be distinctly increased after cytokine therapy, to participate in the repair process by angiomyogenesis in the ischemic heart. Aim-3: To activate cytoprotective regulatory pathways in donor SkMs before transplantation. Considering a critical role for Akt and Bcl-2 in cell survival and angiogenesis downstream of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1)/Tie-2 signaling pathway, we hypothesize that transplantation of SkMs co-overexpressing Ang-1 and Akt or Bcl-2 will give increased cell survival, enhanced angiogenesis, and improved cardiac function. Aim-4 will focus on in vitro re-programming of donor cells for directed differentiation via co-culture with cardiomyocytes to adopt cardiac phenotype after transplantation. The co-culture derived cells will show better engraftment and transdifferentiation after transplantation. Put together, our combined therapeutic approach for preconditioning and re-programming of donor cells before transplantation is expected to give better prognosis in the treatment of ischemically injured myocardium.

Signaling and modulation of TGF-beta dependent inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) and c-myc with G1 arrest, occurs through Smads. Smad2, SmadS and Smad4 are key proteins involved in gastrointestinal cell proliferation. Germline mutations in Smad2 and Smad4 result in a predisposition of the individuals to the development of gastrointestinal carcinoma. We have shown that disruption of elf, a beta-Spectrin disrupts TGF-beta signaling through SmadS and Smad4. Moreover, double heterozygotes of elf and Smad4 (elf+/-/Smad4+/-) develop earlier gastric hyperplasia and tumors. To gain further insight into the role of elf/Smad4 in cell cycle regulation and neoplasia, we propose: (1) to carry out a detailed characterization of gastric cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from elf/~/Smad4+/- mice to determine the effect of loss of ELF on cell cycle kinetics, ability of these cells to undergo senescence, susceptibility of gastric cells and fibroblasts to apoptotic stimuli; and susceptibility of gastric cells and MEFs to neoplastic transformation by oncogenes. (2) To determine the molecular basis for the enhanced susceptibility of the elf/Smad4+/- mice to the development of tumors and determine the nature of secondary events that lead to tumor formation. (3) To investigate the collaboration between the elf/Smad4 and p53 pathways, using elf+/-/Smad4+/- and Smad4+/- mice and mice deficient in p53. (4) To extend experiments described in Aim 1 to whole animal model systems by determining enhanced susceptibility of the elf/~/Smad4+/- and Smad4+/- mice to the development of carcinomas following treatment with chemical carcinogens such as MNU and/or DMBA, and H. pylori VacA toxin, and carrying out experiments aimed at determining the molecular basis for enhanced susceptibility to neoplasia in the elf/'/Smad4+/- and Smad4+/- mice.","313662",

the adult. However, these FGFs are immobilized in an inactive state on the extracellular matrix and it is only
poorly understood how they are solubilized and activated to reach their extracellular receptors. One
mechanism through which FGFs can be mobilized is by binding to secreted binding proteins (BPs) and we
showed that BP1 can enhance the activity of locally stored, immobilized FGFs. BP1 expression is controlled
by stress pathways in cultured cells and found upregulated after wounding, toxic or infectious injury of the
skin or kidneys. BP1 expression in mice carrying an inducible BP1 transgene caused a significant rise in
mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) by +30 mm Hg within two days of transgene induction and analysis of
vascular contractility showed a sensitization to angiotensin II. The rise of MAP after BP1 transgene
expression was inhibited by systemic administration of the superoxide dismutase mimetic Tempol
suggesting an essential role of oxidative stress. We hypothesize that BP1/FGF signaling modulates the
sensitivity of blood vessels towards contractile signaling and propose to study this under the following aims:
Aim 1. To evaluate the contribution of FGF-2 or other FGFs to the BP1-induced hypertensive effect. We will
study blood pressure, vessel contractility and renal tubular function in FGF-2(-/-) mice that are crossed with
mice carrying an inducible BP1 transgene. Systemic administration of BP1 and FGF-2 will complement this.
Aim 2. To study the contribution of kidney expression of BP1 to blood pressure regulation, vessel
contractility and renal tubular function we will use mice harboring a HoxB7-controlled, tetracycline inducible
BP1 transgene. To evaluate the role of endogenous BP1 to oxidative stress-regulated blood pressure, we
will generate mice that are null for BP1 expression.
Aim 3. To study the intracellular cross-talk between BP1 / FGF signaling and G-protein coupled receptor
pathways we will monitor signal transduction and phenotypic effects in preglomular smooth muscle cells
from experimental animals. Biochemical signaling via known integrators of the pathways (i.e. MAPKs) and
proliferation/cell survival and superoxide generation will be used as read-outs. Mass spectrometry to identify
new signaling proteins in the cross-talk will complement this.

gel. Single MDCK cellsgrow to form hollow cysts lined by a monolayer of epithelial cells. When these cysts
are stimulated with Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), they form tubules over a period of ~3 days. This is a
good model system for studying renal tubule formation, and can also provide informationon several
pathophysiological processes, such as recovery from acute tubular necrosis, renal fibrosis, polycystickidney
disease and perhaps renal regeneration from stem cells.We will study the signaling pathways by which cells
respond to HGF. The kinetics of activation of ERKsuggest that it is activated by a MAPK cascadeinvolving
B-Raf, rather than the better known Raf-1. We will test this hypothesis by studying activation of components
of the B-Raf pathway and by using dominant negatives and RNAi. We will test the involvement of Rho
family GTPases, Rho Kinase and lipid rafts in the early stages of tubulogenesis, especially the formation of
extensions from the basolateral surface of cells in cysts. We will use time lapse confocal microscopy to
observe the effects of perturbing these molecular components on extension formation.We will test the
involvement of phosphatidyl inositol (3,4,5)P3 [PI(3,4,5)P3]in extension formation. We have found that
exogenous PI(3,4,5)P3 induces extension formation and we will test if these extensions are identical to those
produced by HGF. We will analyze possible effectors of PI(3,4,5)P3.
Kidney diseases, including developmental defects, kidney injury and genetic conditions that form multiple
cysts in the kidney, are major health problems. The kidney consists of many narrow tubes lined by cells. We

tube formation and how we can influence this to treat and prevent kidney diseases.","252902",

Attempts to successfully transplant islets to diabetic subjects now hold promise (Edmunton Protocol). We hypothesize that the lack of successful engraftment is due to the situation in which mature beta-cells in the islets are mostly post-mitotic, and that successful engraftment requires the neogenesis of new beta-cells from stem/progenitor cells that reside within the islets. Therefore, we propose an approach whereby freshly isolated islets are pre-cultured for several days with growth factors such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) to expand the population of stem/progenitor cells in the islets prior to their transplantation. To justify such an approach, we propose to demonstrate successful engraftment of islet-derived stem/progenitor cells (IPCs) transplanted into streptozotocin-induced diabetic and NOD diabetic mice treated with GLP-1. In initial studies, we have successfully isolated stem/progenitor cells from human (and rat, and mouse) pancreatic islets, have expanded them ex vivo, and have converted them into insulin-producing islet-like clusters, (ILCs) in response to GLP-1. The IPCs are multipotential as they differentiate into hepatic, neural, ductal, hematopoietic and mesenchymal phenotypes. The proglucagon gene is expressed in both the pancreas and the intestine. By mechanisms of alternative post-translational processing of proglucagon, the pancreas produces glucagon and in the intestine produces glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone that has potent insulinotropic, neogenic and cytoprotective actions on beta-cells of the pancreas, peripheral actions on adipose and skeletal muscle to enhance glucose uptake, and on liver to inhibit glucose output. We propose that GLP-1 activates specific cAMP-coupled receptors on pancreatic beta-cells and, synergetically with glucose, stimulates insulin release and acts on islet and IPCs to promote their differentiation into beta-cells. The aims are to: (1) examine the potential properties of GLP-1 to enhance growth and to inhibit apoptosis of pancreatic beta-cells and to stimulate the differentiation of pancreatic IPCs into beta-cells; (2) isolate, identify, and characterize the peripheral GLP-1 receptor expressed on adipocytes. We propose to clone the receptor from a 3T3-L1 cell cDNA expression library, prepare stable cell lines expressing the receptor, characterize the hierarchy of peptide hormone binding and the coupling to signal transduction pathways, and investigate the potential role of the receptor in diabetes. The importance of GLP-1 hormones encoded by the proglucagon gene in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, and their potential relevance to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, provides impetus in learning more about the controlling factors involved in the actions of GLP-1 agonists.

Congenital and acquired corneal diseases are exemplified by altered genetic functions. To better treat corneal diseases, it is imperative to gain insights of gene functions during embryonic development and pathogenesis in adults. To determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms of corneal epithelial differentiation and wound healing, a mouse line expressing Cre recombinase by the corneal epithelium has been prepared by knock-in the phage Cre gene into the Krt12 allele via gene targeting techniques. Additional mouse lines using Cre/IoxP system are prepared from the Krt12Cre knock-in mice for corneal epithelium-specific expression of green fluorescent protein, conditional ablations of Jun and Fos in compound floxed transgenic mice, Krt12Cre/Cre-RosaSF, Krt12Cre/Cre-Junf/f (homozygous floxed Jun) and Krt12Cre/Cre-Fosf/f, respectively. Aim 1 is to determine differentiation and wound healing of corneal epithelium: Aim 1a is to examine the hypothesis that one of the two Krt12 alleles is preferentially used by individual corneal epithelial cells, Aim 1b is to determine the kinetics of differentiation during embryonic development and post natal growth of cornea, Aim 1c tests the hypothesis that corneal TAC (transit amplifying cells) cells of young mice are stem cell-like and of stem cell characteristics. To examine roles of
AP-1 transcription factors on homeostasis of corneal epithelium and healing of corneal epithelium
debridement, conditional Jun and Fos knockout mice (Krt12Cre/Cre-Junf/f and  Krt12Cre/Cre-Fosf/f) are prepared. Aim 2 is to determine roles of Jun on cornea-type epithelium differentiation and wound healing. Corneas of adult Krt12Cre/Cre-Junf/f mice will be subject to immunohistochemistry, northern and in situ hybridization, to determine the roles of Jun on homeostasis of corneal epithelium. The AP-1 dimers will be determined by immune precipitation with anti-Fos antibodies and western blot with anti-Jun family member.

Abstract
 The emergence of pattern during embryogenesis requires dynamic control of gene function with
spatiotemporal precision. Genetic screens and transgenic models have revealed many of the molecular
mechanisms that regulate this transformation, and the completion of multiple genome sequencing projects has
provided a comprehensive list of developmental genes. Our efforts to understand embryonic patterning at the
molecular and systems levels, however, have been limited by current technologies for studying embryological
processes. New methods for controlling and visualizing gene function in vivo are needed. In this application
we describe synthetic probes that will enable the detection of endogenous RNAs or tagged proteins in live
organisms, with at least picomolar sensitivity. In particular, we will develop reagents that couple gene
expression with lanthanide luminescence and utilize them to interrogate the molecular mechanisms of
zebrafish embryogenesis. The proposed reagents build upon our expertise in synthetic chemistry and
zebrafish embryology, and they complement reverse-genetic technologies previously developed by our
laboratory. Using these chemical tools, developmental biologists will be able to simultaneously observe gene
function and morphogenesis in real time, providing an unprecedented mechanistic view of embryogenesis.","800000",

Findings in animal models of acute colitis and in patients with CD indicate benefits of growth hormone (GH) therapy in CD but the documented fibrogenic effects of GH and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) which is induced by GH, support a hypothesis that GH therapy may exacerbate fibrosis in CD. Locally expressed IGF-I is up-regulated in myofibroblasts at sites fibrosis in CD and animal models of chronic intestinal inflammation implicating IGF-I as an endogenous mediator of fibrosis. Preliminary data support a hypothesis that suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), may limit the fibrogenic actions of therapeutic or endogenous cytokines and growth factors in the inflamed intestine. Other data support a hypothesis that IGF-I interacts with another key cytokine, TNF-alpha to mediate collagen synthesis or proliferation in intestinal myofibroblasts, key cellular mediators of fibrosis in CD. Specific aims are as follows:Aim 1 will define if systemic GH increases fibrosis, circulating or locally expressed IGF-I during PG-PS induced enterocolitis. Cellular sites and levels of SOCS expression will be assessed to verify that SOCS2 or SOCS3 are expressed at in vivo sites that would permit them to limit fibrosis.Aim 2 will define if IGF-I mediates GH action on collagen synthesis or proliferation in intestinal myofibroblasts and test whether SOCS limit GH or IGF-I action.Aim 3 will define if mice with absolute or mesenchyme-specific SOCS2 deficiency show altered fibrosis, JGF-I induction or GH action during TNBS-colitis.Aim 4 will define mechanisms if TNF-alpha has additive or synergistic effects with IGF-I, to induce collagen synthesis in intestinal myofibroblasts and if SOCS limit these effects.","88500",

These extracellular factors contribute to and promote most stages of tumor development. For example, tumors of the mammary gland are strongly influenced by the activity of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family members. EGF binding to its cognate receptor is thought to contribute to breast cancer cell cycle regulation by activating signaling pathways that facilitate cyclin D1 expression, cyclin dependent kinase 4 or 6 (Cdk4t6) activation and, ultimately, retinoblastoma (Rb) inactivation. While Rb inactivation is critically important for oncogene-induced malignancies, the nature of the signals induced by oncogenes to facilitate this are incompletely understood. We recently discovered that the pro-inflammatory cytokine, migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is both necessary and sufficient for mitogen and oncogene-induced cyclin D1 transcription, Cdk4 activity and Rb inactivation. Moreover, our results reveal that MIF is strongly induced by tumor promoting oncogenes and cells from MIF-deficient mice are resistant to oncogene-induced  malignant transformation. Despite these findings, more work is needed to investigate in detail the influence, mechanism and effectors of MIFs contribution to Rb inactivation, malignant growth properties and de novo tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that MIF promotes both normal and neoplastic cell growth by stimulating RhoA GTPase activity that leads to the activation of the canonical MAP kinase pathway and resulting in cyclin D1 transcription and Rb inactivation. To test the fundamentals of our hypothesis and fulfill the stated objectives of this application, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) Examine the regulatory and effector requirements for MIF in cyclin D1 transcription focusing on Rho GTPase activated pathways; 2) Test the requirements for MIF in human breast carcinoma Rho activation, cyclin D1 expression and Rb inactivation, and; 3) Investigate the contribution and functional requirements for MIF in de novo mammary tumorigenesis. This work should contribute to a greater understanding of the physiologic and pathologic importance of soluble growth factors to cell cycle regulation and neoplastic processes and may reveal a novel target for future cancer therapies.","228588",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research project focuses on the urokinase receptor (uPAR), a multifunctional GPI-anchored membrane protein that has been implicated in breast cancer progression. Our long-term goal is to understand mechanisms by which uPAR regulates cancer cell physiology. uPAR binds at least two ligands: the plasminogen activator, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), and the provisional extracellular matrix protein, vitronectin. Within the plasma membrane, uPAR laterally associates with integrins, G-protein coupled receptors, and receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTKs). These ""co-receptor"" interactions result in the formation of a dynamic, multiprotein signaling receptor complex (MSRC). uPA and vitronectin activate uPAR-dependent cell signaling; however, the pathways are distinct. uPA-binding activates ERK/MAP kinase whereas vitronectin activates Rad. Other signaling proteins, such as STAT-5b, may be recruited downstream of uPAR depending on the co-receptors that associate with uPAR in the MSRC. Co-receptors also determine the nature of the cellular response, such as whether uPA is mitogenic. In this application, four specific aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we propose to elucidate the pathway that leads from uPAR to Rac1 and determine the mechanism by which ligation of a single receptor (uPAR) with two distinct ligands (uPA or vitronectin) causes completely distinct cell signaling responses. Aim 2 builds on preliminary data in which we have demonstrated that uPAR over-expression induces epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), a well known process associated with cancer progression in which epithelial cells adopt a fibroblast-like morphology, lose cell-cell contacts, demonstrate increased vimentin expression and decreased E-cadherin expression. Experiments planned in Aim 2 will determine the mechanism by which uPAR induces EMT. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that uPAR-dependent cell signaling regulates the response of cancer cells not only to uPA but also to growth factors such as EGF and PDGF. Understanding crosstalk between uPAR and RTKs is a critical objective. Finally, in Aim 4, we propose studies to determine whether uPAR-dependent cell signaling is involved in cancer development and progression in vivo. Xenograft and spontaneous neoplasia mouse-model systems will be applied. These studies will elucidate the role of uPAR in cancer and provide critical information regarding how uPAR may be targeted for novel cancer therapeutics design.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Up to 1% of all human infants are born with some form of genitourinary abnormality, with a large proportion of them having involvement of the urinary bladder. Abnormal structure and/or function of the bladder results in significant morbidity, including infections, incontinence and even renal insufficiency. Because of its clinical significance, we have begun to study the molecular basis of organogenesis of the urinary bladder. Organogenesis requires the orderly execution of programs that regulate temporally and spatially defined cellular differentiation and proliferation. Surprisingly very little is actually known about the events that occur during normal bladder organogenesis. This is in part due to the lack of an appropriate experimental animal model with which to study the development of the fetal bladder.  
The long term goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular basis of urinary bladder organogenesis in vertebrates, using Xenopus as an experimental system. In our preliminary experiments, we have demonstrated that Xenopus is an ideal model for this proposal since the urinary bladder develops in the larval stage and can be readily accessed. Additionally, we have discovered that the Uroplakin family of genes is expressed very early in embryogenesis and bladder organogenesis. This is significant because Uroplakins have long been considered markers of terminal urothelial differentiation. This proposal seeks to extend our understanding of the molecular regulation of bladder organogenesis, and the role that Uroplakin plays in this developmental pathway with the following specific aims: (1) Identify and characterize the genes involved in bladder organogenesis; (2) Examine the mechanism(s) by which the genes identified in specific aim 1 regulate bladder organogenesis; (3) To determine the function of the Uroplakin genes in early embryogenesis and bladder organogenesis. Through these studies, the candidate will delineate the signal transduction pathways that regulate bladder organogenesis. The results of this proposal will significantly broaden our insights into bladder development, growth, regeneration and response to injury. This knowledge will be utilized to enhance the outcomes of current therapeutic interventions and improve the quality of life for patients with congenital or acquired bladder dysfunction.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common type of birth defect. Valvuloseptal defects, which result from aberrant endocardial cushion development, comprise up to one third of CHD, and also are a significant cause of adult morbidity/mortality. Although progress has been made in delineating single gene defects that perturb valvulogenesis in mouse and man, how these genes regulate development, and how normal development is altered by disease-associated mutations, remain largely unknown. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation, controlled by protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), is a key cellular regulatory mechanism., Many growth factor receptors are transmembrane PTKs, and several are implicated in valvulogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), produced by myocardjal cells, inhibits endocardial-mesechymal transition (EMT), a key initial event in which specialized endocardia! cells transform into mesenchymal cells that invade the cushion matrix and proliferate. ErbB3, most likely partnering with ErbB2 (HER2) and responding to heregulin (HRG), promotes EMT and/or mesenchymal proliferation. Conversely, heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), acting via the EGFR (ErbB1), terminates mesenchymal cell proliferation and plays a key role in valve remodeling. The non-receptor PTP, Shp2 (PTPN11), also plays an essential role in valve development. Shp2 deficiency enhances the effect of EGFR loss of function in mice, resulting in abnormal valve thickening. Furthermore, ~50% of cases of the autosomal dominant disorder Nponan syndrome (NS), the most common non-chromosomal cause of CHD, is caused by PTPN11 mutations. Structural, enzymologic, and biochemical studies, and a mouse NS model generated in our laboratory, indicate that NS mutations are gain-of-function alleles that enhance Erk MAP kinase activation in developing cardiac cushions. PTPN11 mutations also cause LEOPARD syndrome (LS), which exhibits an overlapping spectrum of cardiac defects. But we showed recently that unlike NS alleles, LS mutants are PTP-inactive, and act as dominant negative mutants that impair Erk activation. Based on these data, we hypothesize that NS and LS mutations cause similar cardiac valve defects by acting in opposing ways on distinct RTK pathways at different times during valvulogenesis. We propose a combined biochemical, cell biological and genetic approach to address key questions about the pathogenesis of cardiac defects caused by human PTPN11 mutations. Aim 1 will use an inducible knock-in approach to determine the cell type and developmental interval in which NS mutants act to cause valvuloseptal defects. In Aim 2, we will study an allelic series of Shp2 knock-in alleles, asking if the specific PTPN11 mutation affects the NS cardiac phenotype, and generate a knock-in mouse model of LS to test the hypothesis that LS mutants act later during valvulogenesis to inhibit EGFR signaling/remodeling. Finally, Aim 3 will use a combination of mouse models, explant assays, and pharmacologic agents to test the hypothesis that NS alleles enhance ErbB2/3 signaling to the Ras/Erk pathway, thereby enhancing EMT and possibly mesenchymal proliferation. Our results should yield new insights into the pathogenesis of CHD, and may have important implications for the therapy of NS and LS.

Dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) (15% effort): Genetic mutations of the dentin sialophosphosphoprotein (DSSP) gene are responsible for DI and dentin dysplasia (DD). Dentin, the most abundant tissue in teeth, is produced by odontoblasts, which differentiate from mesenchymal cells of the dental papilla. Dentin defects are broadly classified into two major types: DIs, types I-III and dentin dysplasias (DDs, types I and II). To date, mutations in DSPP have been found to underlie DI types II and III and DD type II. With the elucidation of the underlying genetic mechanisms has come the realization that the clinical characteristics associated with DSPP mutations appear to represent a continuum of phenotypes. (Hart & Hart 2007). Recent work (McKnight et al 2008) describing studies of 9 families segregating DI or DD has substantiated that the clinical characteristics associated with DSPP mutations appear to represent a continuum of phenotypes. Within nine DDtype II and DI type II and III patients, seven have 1 of 4 net -1 deletions within the approximately 2-kb coding repeat domain of the DSPP gene while the remaining two patients have splice-site mutations. All frameshift mutations are predicted to change the highly soluble DSPP protein into proteins with long hydrophobic amino acid repeats that could interfere with processing of normal DSPP and/or other secreted matrix proteins. We propose that all previously reported missense, nonsense, and splice-site DSPP mutations (all associated with exons 2 and 3) result in dominant phenotypes due to disruption of signal peptide-processing and/or related biochemical events that also result in interference with protein processing. 
Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) (30%effort): We continue to study families segregating the AI phenotype. AI is caused by AMEL, ENAM, MMP20 and KLK4 gene mutations. Mice lacking expression of the AmelX, Enam and Mmp20 genes have been generated. These models provide tools for understanding enamel formation and AI pathogenesis. We determined human AI phenotypes in a clinical population of 463 AI affected individuals from 54 families were evaluated and mutations in the AMEL, ENAM and KLK4 genes identified. The majority of human mutations for genes coding enamel nonproteinase proteins (AMEL and ENAM) resulted in variable hypoplasia ranging from local pitting to a marked, generalized enamel thinning. Specific AMEL mutations were associated with abnormal mineralization and maturation defects. Amel and Enam null murine models displayed marked enamel hypoplasia and defective mineral crystal structure. Human mutations in genes coding for the enamel proteinases (MMP20 and KLK4) cause variable degrees of hypomineralization. The murine Mmp20 null mouse exhibits both hypoplastic and hypomineralized defects. Amel and Enam mouse models for AI exhibit enamel phenotypes (hypoplastic) that are similar to those in humans. Mmp20 null mice have a greater degree of hypoplasia than humans with MMP20 mutations. Mice lacking expression of the currently known genes associated with the human AI conditions provide useful models for understanding the pathogenesis of these conditions.(Wright et al 2008). 
Not all AI causing mutations have been identified. We studied 8 Turkish kindreds with autosomal dominant hypoplastic AI and identified FAM83H mutations in all 8 families.  A total of 3 different FAM83H nonsense mutations; a p.Q398X mutation and 2 novel nonsense mutations, p.Q444X and p.Q456X, were detected.  These findings indicate that FAM83H mutations may be responsible for the majority of autosomal dominant hypocalcified amelogenesis imperfecta in the Turkish population. As the most predominant form of autosomal dominant AI, these findings have important implications for the implementation of genetic testing to confirm this clinical diagnosis. (Hart et al 2008 In Press).
TDO studies-45%effort:Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome (TDO) due to DLX3 mutations is characterized by anomalies of tooth, hair and bone. A cardinal feature of TDO is an increased thickness and density of bone. We tested the effects of the DLX3 gene mutation responsible for TDO on the osteoblastic differentiation of preosteoblastic MC3T3E1 cells and multipontent mesenchymal C2C12 cells. Transfection of wild type DLX3 into MC3T3E1 and C2C12 cells increased alkaline phosphatase-2 activity, mineral deposition, and promoter activities of the osteocalcin and type 1 collagen genes. Transfection of mutant DLX3 into these cells further enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity, mineral deposition, and osteocalcin promoter activities, but did not further enhance type 1 collagen promoter activity. Transfection of mutant DLX3 into C2C12 cells markedly down regulated desmin gene expression, and protein expression of desmin and MyoD, while increasing protein expression of osterix and Runx2. These results demonstrate that the DLX3 deletion mutation associated with TDO enhances mesenchymal cell differentiation to an osteoblastic lineage. (Choi et al 2008).  As in vitro findings do not always recapitulate the true in vivo biology, we generated a transgenic model with mice carrying the 4bp DLX3 mutation driven by a collagen 1A1 promoter. Studies are ongoing to characterize the biologic mechanism by which this DLX3 mutation results in beneficial bone changes and pathologic changes in the enamel, dentin and pulp.
We have characterized dental/oral and craniofacial findings in a number of rare genetic syndromes (10% effort) Hyperimmunoglobulin-E syndrome (HIES) is a primary immunodeficiency characterized by eczema, recurrent infections, and extremely elevated serum immunoglobulin-E. Non-immunologic findings include characteristic facial features (prominent forehead, fleshy nasal tip, and increased interalar distance); skeletal involvement (pathological fractures, scoliosis, and craniosynostosis); and retention of primary teeth. We characterized intraoral soft tissue findings in 60 HIES patients. Our study revealed the presence of lesions of the hard palate and dorsal tongue in 55% and 60% of patients, respectively. Palatal lesions ranged from a generalized surface keratosis to a midline sagittal fibrotic bridge. Tongue lesions consisted of multiple fissures and a midline cleft. On the lip and buccal mucosa, keratotic plaques and/or surface fissures were found in 8% and 23% of patients, respectively. Manifested in 76.7% of patients, the intraoral lesions were significantly more prevalent than the characteristic facial traits (P=0.0013). These findings indicate that alterations in oral mucosa and gingiva were present in the majority of HIES patients. These novel intraoral findings may facilitate the diagnosis of HIES. (Domingo et al 2008).
Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome is a rare, sporadic, autosomal dominant syndrome withpremature aging, generally leading to death at 13 years of age due to myocardial infarction or stroke. We participated in a multi institute NIH study to characterize the natural history of progeria patients. 15 children representing nearly half of the world's known patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome were evaluated as part of a comprehensive clinical protocol at NIH. Oral abnormalities characterized included hypodontia (most often, missing second premolars), tongue-tie, high arch palate, double rows of teeth, and delayed tooth eruption.

They signal through heteromeric complexes of two types of cell surface, transmembrane serine-threonine kinases, resulting in phosphorylation and consequent activation of Smads, which then act as signaling effectors in the regulation of TGF-beta-induced gene expression. Extensive research during the last few years has revealed a general model for how receptor-activated Smads activate transcription through cooperation with sequence-specific transcription factors at the promoter DNA. In contrast, little is known about the mechanisms that result in downregulation of gene expression in response to TGF-beta. We now propose to continue our ongoing research on the regulation of gene expression in response to TGF-beta. In Aim 1, we will study the mechanism of TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated repression of transcription by MyoD/MEF2 and CBFA1, which naturally drive differentiation in myoblasts and osteoblasts, respectively. The molecular characterization of these two model systems for TGF-beta/Smad3-mediated repression should provide insight into general features and may lead to a general model for the mechanism of transcription repression by TGF-beta family members through Smads. Furthermore, the study of the regulation of CBFA1 function will allow us to characterize the roles of the CBFAl-binding DNA sequence and the cell context (mesenchymal versus epithelial) in TGF-beta-mediated repression versus activation of transcription. Aim 2 will focus on the crosstalk between IRF-3/7 and Smad signaling and the role of IRF-3/7 in TGF-b/Smad signaling. IRF-3 and IRF-7 are two closely related members of the ""interferon regulatory factor"" (IRF) family of transcription factors. Viral infection activates IRF-3/7 and induces IRF-7 expression, which leads to type I interferon and RANTES expression. We will characterize the crosstalk between IRF-3/7 and TGF-beta/Smad signaling at the IRF-3/7-responsive interferon b promoter, and conversely evaluate the effect of IRF-3/7 on Smad-mediated transcription. We will also evaluate the role of TGF-beta/Smad signaling in the antiviral induction of interferon, driven by IRF-3/7, and evaluate a possible direct role of IRF-3/7 in TGF-beta signaling. Mutation analyses of IRF-3/7, based on the three-dimensional IRF-3, structure will assist in these investigations.","470607",

In particular, we will explore the possibility that these halogenated hydrocarbons may disrupt specific biochemical processes that are essential for the normal embryonic differentiation including a methionine salvage pathway and tyrosine

In addition, we will test the hypothesis that is possible to prevent or ameliorate the occurrence of disorders induced by these toxicants in the cardiovascular system by dietary intervention with folic acid. In order to address these issues, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Identify altered cardiac gene expression due to maternal TCE exposure in genetically modified (CYP2E1 null) and normal mouse model; 2. Identify altered cardiac gene expression due to maternal exposure to TCAA and DCAA in normal and GSTz null mice; and 3. Assess the effects of folic acid deficiency and supplementation, created by diet, on alteration of gene expression induced by maternal exposure to TCE and TCAA. Our previous research has
documented the ability of TCE and TCAA to alter the expression of numerous genes, including some involved in crucial developmental processes such as the formation of valves and septa in the embryonic heart, and genes involved in regulating calcium concentrations. In the current study we will use this information to identify the molecular pathways that are disrupted by TCE and TCAA and try to reverse or minimize their negative effects on development by dietary supplementation with folic acid. The outcome of these studies will be highly significant in light of the potential implications for the design of preventive strategies in exposed populations."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that disruption of embryonic programming and gonadal development during human fetal life can result in testicular dysgenesis, manifested as undescended testis, hypospadias, poor semen quality, and testicular cancer. Preliminary data indicates that exposure of Leydig cells to low and environmentally relevant concentrations of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in vivo and mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) in vitro altered the genomic and proteomic profile of the cells in a manner that parallels the inhibition of hormone-dependent steroid formation and the induction of Leydig cell hyperplasia. The central objective of this proposal is to gain greater understanding of the fetal basis of male reproductive disorders by elucidating the mechanisms by which exposure of the fetus to the environmental antiandrogen DEHP suppresses fetal testosterone production and later, testosterone and estradiol production by the adult. Our major goals are to identify the cellular targets and the molecular mechanisms underlying the responses of the fetus to DEHP, and to reveal the mechanisms by which effects on the fetus lead to pathologies of the male reproductive tract in the adult. The overarching hypothesis is that in utero exposures to DEHP suppress fetal testosterone production by direct effects on fetal Leydig cells and/or on the mesenchymal cells that are the precursors of adult Leydig cells, and by doing so, suppresses postnatal development and function of the adult Leydig cell population. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims: (1) identify the cellular and molecular targets of gestational DEHP in the fetal testis; (2) identify the mechanism(s) by which gestational exposure to DEHP results in reduced testosterone production by the fetal testis; and (3) determine the effects of fetal exposure to DEHP on the formation and function of the adult population of Leydig cells and its impact on testicular function in the immature and adult testis. We believe that these Aims will identify the molecular signaling pathways and characterize their role in mediating the hyperplasic and antiandrogenic effect of phthalates leading to testicular dysgenesis in the adult. Taken together the proposed studies will unveil the endocrine disruptor-sensitive steps in the steroidogenic pathway that are affected by this antiandrogen, and the mechanisms and consequences of endocrine disruption on the endocrine milieu of the adult.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recovery from liver damage requires regeneration. Ethanol (EtOH) delays induction of hepatocyte DNA synthesis by partial hepatectomy (PH). Thus, it may promote chronic liver disease by inhibiting liver regeneration. We have been trying to characterize the mechanisms involved by first defining how liver injury normally triggers hepatocyte replication and then, identifying which of these mechanisms is altered by EtOH. Progress in both areas suggests this GENERAL HYPOTHESIS: EtOH disturbs normal liver regeneration because it causes mature hepatocytes to accumulate excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS inhibit mature hepatocyte replication and cause senescence. This, in turn, promotes the proliferation of less differentiated liver cells, delaying recovery. Aim #1 is to delineate mechanisms for EtOH-related mitoinhibition in mature hepatocytes. Our data support the hypothesis that EtOH inhibits proliferation and induces replicative senescence in hepatocytes by exacerbating mitochondrial ROS production. We will evaluate this paradigm: Chronic EtOH ? mitochondrial GSH depletion ?changes in ROS regulatory enzyme activities? increased H2O2?p38 MAPK activation? inhibited cyclin D-1 transcription? reduced Cyclin D-1 protein? failure to sequester phospho-Stat3 in the cytosol? increased nuclear accumulation of Stat3? increased transcription of p21? inhibited cyclin D-1/cdk activity? G-1/S arrest. Aim #2 is to define the consequences of EtOH-related senescence for mature hepatocytes. Our data demonstrate that PH increases ROS production and DNA damage, inducing the DNA repair enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). PARP activation transiently reduces hepatic ATP stores. EtOH ingestion chronically increases ROS-related DNA damage, necessitating chronic PARP activity, which may deplete ATP stores to levels that prevent hepatocyte replication and limit further activation of PARP. Our hypothesis is that senescent hepatocytes have DNA damage due to chronic, EtOH-related increases in ROS. We will evaluate this concept: Chronic EtOH? increased H2O2 before PH? baseline DNA damage? increased PARP activity before PH? reduced ATP? delayed cell cycle progression and insufficient induction of PARP after PH? accumulation of senescent hepatocytes with DNA damage. Aim #3 is to determine if (and how) EtOH-related mitoinhibition of mature hepatocytes triggers the expansion of less differentiated liver cell populations. We have evidence that immature liver ""oval"" cells accumulate in the liver during EtOH exposure and find that injury-related factors modulate the oval cell accumulation in mice with hepatic oxidative stress. Our hypothesis is that some of the same factors that inhibit proliferation and cause senescence in mature hepatocytes increase hepatic oval cells during chronic EtOH exposure. We will evaluate this model: Chronic EtOH? hepatic oxidative stress? increased induction of TNFa and other cytokines plus altered activity of autonomic nervous system-->increased progenitor ceil proliferation and/or decreased differentiation and cell death? hepatic accumulation of oval cells. Because EtOH inhibits the replication of mature hepatocytes, regeneration after alcoholic liver injury requires hepatocyte progenitors.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and often fatal disease complicating many types of human lung diseases. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediates signals induced by a family of growth factors including transforming growth factor-( (TGF-(). Studies from this laboratory and others have shown increased EGFR ligands in several human fibrotic diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IFF). Expression of TGF-( in the epithelium of transgenic mice caused progressive and extensive pulmonary fibrosis with histological features very similar to those seen in human disease. Fibrosis in TGF-( transgenic mice is prevented or reversed using genetic or pharmacological approaches signifying that EGFR-mediated fibrosis is a feasible therapeutic target. Phosphorylation of the EGFR can induce several downstream signaling pathways, including the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway. Activation of EGFR in TGF-( transgenic mice phosphorylates Akt in the epithelium and TGF-( added to respiratory epithelial cells stimulates profibrotic gene expression that can be prevented by blocking PI3K signaling. The long term goal of this application is to develop novel and effective therapeutic intervention strategies for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis in humans. The objective of this application is to utilize data from cultured lung cells and transgenic models of fibrosis to determine signaling mechanisms mediating EGFR-induced pulmonary fibrosis and determine if these pathways are increased in fibrotic human lung disease. The central hypothesis is that that increased EGFR signaling via PI3K induces pulmonary fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will use model human cell lines to determine EGFR-induced intracellular signaling pathways leading to synthesis of collagen and proliferation of cells. In Aim 2, we will determine EGFR-induced signaling molecules expressed in vivo in the transgenic model of EGFR-induced lung fibrosis and use well-characterized archival tissue of IPF patients to assess whether EGFR and similar kinases are activated. Preliminary data in the transgenic mice in vivo show that Type II cells produce modulators that regulate fibrosis. In Aim 3, we will use co-cultures to determine mechanisms whereby TGF-( expressing Type II cells regulate pulmonary fibroblasts. Completion of the proposed studies will determine a role of EGFR in lung fibrosis and suggest therapeutic targets to alter the course of human lung fibrosis.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a common disease and a leading cause of death and morbidity in the elderly. The etiology of infrarenal aortic aneurysms remains obscure although increased proteolysis appears to be fundamental to this process. We have previously identified a transcriptionally-mediated increase in total and processed/active matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in AAA tissue. That MMP-2 is required for AAA has been established by recent experimental work from our group showing that MMP-2 knockout mice are resistant to aneurysm induction. We present exciting new preliminary data showing that MMP-2 mRNA and protein levels are increased in the skin of AAA patients in comparison to patients affected with atherosclerotic occlusive disease (AOD; atherosclerosis without aneurysms) or controls (minimal atherosclerosis, no aneurysm). Plasma MMP-2 levels are also increased in AAA compared to AOD or controls. This latest finding suggests systemic over-expression of MMP-2 and is consistent with the known propensity of AAA patients to get incisional hernias after abdominal surgery. Among the single nucleotide polymorphisms found in the MMP-2 promoter, only one alters MMP-2 protein levels by disrupting an Sp-1 binding site. We I hypothesize that systemic MMP-2 dysregulation leads to aneurysm formation. This proposal will investigate a number of aspects of MMP-2 metabolism by: 1) determining MMP-2 protein levels in the blood of a larger group of AAA, AOD and control patients; 2) determining the frequency of a common, functional polymorphism in the MMP-2 promoter in AAA and AOD patients; 3) determining the ability of short interfering RNA molecules (siRNA) to inhibit MMP-2 expression and prevent aneurysm formation in a murine AAA model; 4) determining the role of macrophage-derived MT1-MMP in the activation of MMP-2. The goal of aim 1 is to develop a screening test for AAA. Aim 2 could identify an important underlying mechanism and explain individual susceptibility to AAA. The siRNA to be tested in aim 3 has great potential as a specific molecular tool for investigation and therapy. The interaction between resident MMP production and local activation by inflammatory cells (specific aim 4) is an Important fundamental question in matrix biology. Answers to the questions addressed by this proposal will greatly advance our current knowledge of AAA and other inflammatory disease processes associated with matrix destruction.","273126",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): IGF-I, insulin and IGF-II share common signal transduction mechanisms, reduce crypt cell apoptosis and promote transition of normal intestinal epithelium to a precancerous or cancerous phenotype. Insulin- receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) is a common signaling intermediate for IGF (IGFIR) and insulin receptors (IR) that mediates the anti-apoptotic actions of the IGFs and insulin. Polymorphisms in IRS-1 are linked to increased colon cancer risk. EGFR, another key mediator of intestinal neoplasia interacts with IGFIR to promote survival and growth of cancer cell lines. Our recent studies defined suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) as an intrinsic negative regulator of IGF-I action in the intestine. SOCS2 is silenced in cancer cell ines. SOCS2 binds directly to the IGF-IR and limits IGF-I dependent activation are linked to increased colon cancer risk. EGFR, another key mediator of intestinal neoplasia interacts with IGFIR to promote survival and growth of cancer cell lines. Our recent studies defined suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2) as an intrinsic negative regulator of IGF-I action in the intestine. SOCS2 is silenced in cancer cell ines. SOCS2 binds directly to the IGF-IR and limits IGF-I dependent activation of IGF-IR and IRS-1. Other data indicate that SOCS2 limits the trophic actions of EGF on the intestine. Proposed aims will test the following hypotheses. Aim #1 will test the hypothesis that IRS-1 promotes transition of normal intestinal epithelial cells to a precancerous phenotype by mediating IGF-I or insulin activation of the p-catenin signaling pathway. This aim will examine tumor growth and survival and IGF-l/insulin activation of p -catenin pathways in WT and ApcMin/+mice with 0,1 or 2 functional IRS-1 genes, and cell lines with knockdown of IRS-1. Aim #2 will test a hypothesis that IGF-IR/IRS-1 and EGF pathways interact to promote B-catenin activation and intestinal tumorigenesis. This aim will examine EGF/IGF-I interactions on B-catenin in primary I EC and model cell lines. Effects of IRS-1 deficiency combined with an EGFR inhibitor will be examined in ApcMin/+ mice. Tumors that survive inhibition of EGFR will be assessed for compensatory up- regulation of pathways that facilitate IGF-I dependent survival. Aim #3 will test the hypothesis that SOCS2 silencing promotes intestinal tumorigenesis by enhancing IGF-I activation of STAT and p-catenin pathways. This aim will examine tumor growth and survival, activation of STAT or p-catenin and local IGF-I expression in ApcMin/+ mice with 0, 1 or 2 functional SOCS2 genes. We hypothesize that SOCS2 silencing promotes tumorigenesis by dual effects on epithelium and mesenchyme. Aim #4 will test the hypothesis that SOCS2 regulates EGFR signaling. Effects of SOCS2 on EGFR activation and EGFR-induced STAT activation will be tested in cell lines and primary IEC, or tumors from SOCS2 null and WT mice with ApcMin/+ mutation or expressing a GH-transgene. An EKI-785 EGFR inhibitor will be used to directly test if EGFR mediates enhanced STAT activation in SOCS2 deficient tumors.

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prospect of a cell based therapy for cellular regeneration and functional recovery of the heart was realized with the discovery that stem cells can contribute to myocyte formation in the adult and that these stem cells may also participate in the repair of the heart after injury. It is now clear the heart has inherent regenerative capacity however it is also clear that this capacity is limited. Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells into patients evokes a reproducible increase in function and provides insight into the potential of this therapeutic approach. To date, little is known of the systems that create and maintain the inherent cardiac stem cells (CSC) and how they participate in day to day function and homeostasis or during and after injury. Stromal cell derived factor 11 (SDF1), and its receptor, CXCR4 are key components of the biological system that regulates hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem cells. We have found this SDF1-CXCR4 axis in the heart and both are expressed on myocytes and fibroblasts and are functionally coupled to MAPK and AKT signaling that serves a survival function in vitro and in vivo against ischemia reperfusion injury. Both SDF1 and CXCR4 knockouts are embryonic lethal with cardiac defects. These novel findings serve to provide the basis for our hypothesis, that the cardiac SDF1-CXCR4 axis plays a role in cardiac homeostasis through the action on cardiac stem cells, myocytes, and fibroblasts. Myocyte and fibroblast expression of SDF1 and CXCR4 are proposed to serve a similar function for cardiac stem cell maintenance and protection (niche formation) as stromal and osteoblasts do in the bone marrow. The effectiveness of this system in protecting and maintaining the myocardium with stress or injury is limited due to attenuated SDF1-CXCR4 signaling by desensitization of SDF1-CXCR4 signaling. We propose this effectiveness may be increased by increasing the number of receptors and/or limiting desensitization of SDF1- CXCR4 signaling. The following Aims seek to further define the role of the SDF1-CXCR4 axis in cardiac homeostasis and regeneration and to determine how CSC function in cardiac regeneration can be enhanced through optimization of CXCR4 signaling as a cell based therapy in cardiac injury. Aim 1: To determine the role that cardiac SDF1-CXCR4 plays in maintaining cardiac homeostasis in myocyte, myofibroblast, and cardiac stem cells. Aim 2: To determine how desensitization/downregulation of SDF1-CXCR4 signaling limits the functionality of cardiac stem cells. Aim 3: To determine whether increasing signaling and signaling efficacy through the SDF1-CXCR4 axis in cardiac stem cells facilitates increased regenerative capacity by administration early and late after MI and IR injury. Aim 4: To determine whether SDF1-CXCR4 synergizes with HGF-cMET and IGF1-IGFR signaling systems to increase functions critical to stem cell engraftment and repair of functional myocardium. The seminal finding that the heart contains a population of stem cells that can contribute to repair of the injured heart has provided new hope for a cell based therapy for cardiac repair. The research described in this proposal will advance our understanding of and provide mechanistic insight into inherent cardiac systems that regulate the function of cardiac stem cells and their relationship with cardiac muscle and supporting cells. Results from these mechanistic studies will provide the impetus to design novels strategies to overcome inherent limitations of cardiac stem cell participation in cardiac regeneration after cardiac injury or with disease.

A summary of our research progress s presented below:
1.  Cellular signaling mechanism of TGF-beta in osteoblasts
TGF-beta1 action is known to be initiated by its binding to multiple cell surface receptors containing serine/threonine kinase domains that act to stimulate a cascade of signaling events in a variety of cell types. We have previously shown that TGF-beta1 and BMP-2 treatment of primary human osteoblasts (HOB) enhances cell-substrate adhesion.  In this report, we demonstrate that TGF-beta1 elicits a rapid and transient rise in the intracellular calcium concentration, Ca2+i, that is necessary for enhancement of cell adhesion in HOB. This rise in Ca2+i in HOB is not observed in the absence of extracellular calcium or when the cells are treated with the L-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, but is stimulated upon treatment with the L-type calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644, or under high K+ conditions.  The rise in Ca2+i is severely attenuated after treatment of the HOB with thapsigargin, a selective endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump inhibitor. TGF-beta1 enhancement of HOB adhesion to tissue culture polystyrene is also inhibited in cells treated with nifedipine.  These data suggest that intracellular calcium signaling is an important second messenger of the TGF-beta1 signal transduction pathway in osteoblast function.

2.  Spatiotemporal protein distribution of TGF-betas, their receptors, and extracellular matrix molecules during embryonic tendon development
Tendon is one of the least understood tissues of the musculoskeletal system in terms of development and morphogenesis. Collagen fibrillogenesis has been the most studied aspect of tendon development, focusing largely on the role of matrix molecules such as collagen type III and decorin. While involvement of matrix molecules in collagen fibrillogenesis during chick tendon development is well understood, the role of growth factors has yet to be elucidated. This work examines the expression patterns of TGF-beta1, -2, and -3, and their receptors with respect to expression patterns of collagen type III, decorin, and fibronectin. We focus on the intermediate stages of tendon development in the chick embryo, a period during which the tendon micro- and macro-architecture are being established. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that TGF-beta1, -2, and -3
have distinct spatiotemporal developmental protein localization patterns in the developing tendon and strongly suggest that these isoforms have independent roles in tendon development.

3.  Interaction of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein/thrombospondin 5 with aggrecan
Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), also known as thrombospondin 5 (TSP5), is a pentameric extracellular matrix protein.  Based on its sequence COMP/TSP5 belongs to the TSP family (1,2).  It is a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the musculoskeletal system including cartilage, tendon, and ligament.  The physiological function of COMP/TSP5 remains largely unclear, but its importance is underscored by its association with several joint diseases.  To study the functions of COMP/TSP5 in cartilage ECM, we have examined its interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and aggrecan, a major and critical components of cartilage extracellular matrix.  We also tested MUT3, a COMP/TSP5 mutant found to account for 30% of human pseudoachondroplasia cases, to determine if the mutation affects the function of the protein.  Using affinity co-electrophoresis (ACE), we show that COMP/TSP5 bound to heparin, chondroitin sulfates, and heparan sulfate in its native calcium-replete conformation.  EDTA treatment of COMP/TSP5 reduces heparin binding and inhibits chondroitin sulfate binding, implying a conformation-dependent GAG-binding site in the molecule.  MUT3 showed weaker binding to the GAGs than COMP/TSP5 in the presence of Ca, and EDTA treatment of MUT3  further decreased binding. Using a solid binding assay, we showed that COMP/TSP5 can bind aggrecan, which is decreased upon EDTA chelation, in agreement with the ACE data.  MUT3 showed weak interaction with aggrecan.  Also, soluble GAGs inhibited aggrecan binding to COMP/TSP5, suggesting that the interaction of aggrecan with COMP/TSP5 was through binding to its GAG side chains. Using recombinant COMP/TSP5 fragments covering various COMP/TSP5 domains were tested, the C-globe region alone was found to bind to aggrecan in solution, suggesting that this domain can mediate the interaction of COMP/TSP5 and aggrecan.  These data show that COMP/TSP5 is a proteoglycan-binding protein, and it binds aggrecan, possibly through the GAg side chains on aggrecan and the C-globe regain of COMP/TSP5.  This interaction is regulated by calcium-binding sensitiv conformation of the molecule.  Our results suggest that COMP/TSP5 may function to support matrix interaction in the extracellular matrix of cartilage.  

4.  Role of fibronectin splice isoform and splicing factor SRp40 in mesenchymal chondrogenesis and chondrocyte maturation.
Fibronectin (FN) isoform expression is altered during chondrocyte commitment and maturation, with cartilage favoring expression of FN isoforms that include the type II repeat extra domain B (EDB) but exclude extra domain A (EDA). We and others have hypothesized that the regulated splicing of FN mRNAs is necessary for progression of chondrogenesis. To test this, we examined the effect of the chondrogenic growth factor, TGF-beta1 on mesenchymal cells, on the modulation of EDA and EDB exon expression as well as markers of late chondrocyte maturation. When chondrocytes are treated with TGF-beta1, the EDA exon is preferentially excluded at all times whereas the EDB exon is relatively depleted at early times. This regulated alternative splicing of FN correlates with regulation of alternative splicing of SRp40, a splicing factor facilitating inclusion of the EDA exon. Overexpression of the long-form of SRp40 yielded a FN organization similar to TGF-beta1 treatment; whereas overexpression of the short form of SRp40 (which facilitates EDA inclusion) increased formation of long-thick FN fibrils. Therefore, we conclude that the effects of TGF-beta1 on FN splicing during chondrogenesis may be largely dependent on its effect on SRp40 isoform expression.
A variant spliced form of SRp40, SRp40LF, is expressed preferentially in chondrocytes and in chondrifying mesenchymal cells. Forced overexpression of SRp40 or SRp75, but not SRp55, enhanced chondrogenic differentiation of chick limb mesenchymal cells in a high-density micromass assay. SRp40LF overexpression, which produces a truncated form of SRp40, also was strongly pro-chondrogenic. In a HeLa cell-based assay, SRp40LF fails to substitute for SRp40 in mediating an increase in exon EIIIA inclusion, suggesting that the latter event is not essential for the pro-chondrogenic effect. These results demonstrate the ability of these highly conserved splicing factors to modulate chondrogenesis, consistent with earlier results implicating exon EIIIA-contaiining isoforms of fibronectin in formation of chondrogenic condensations.

5.  Nitric oxide and embryonic skeletal dysmorphogenesis
Based on previous results on the teratogenic effects of CO and NO on chick embryos, our recent study showed that NO regulation is essential for normal axial development, that sites of altered NO expression correlate to those of altered apoptosis and dymorphogenesis, and that CO coadministration rectified normal NO expression. Collectively, these results suggest that alteration in endogenous NO/CO signaling is responsible, in part, for the observed NO-induced teratogenesis.","902436",

Design and synthesis of novel Grb2 SH2 domain binding antagonists. In many human       cancers, dysregulated growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation contributes to       tumor cell survival, proliferation and invasiveness, as well as tumor angiogenesis. These       events are critical for cancer progression and thus logical targets for therapeutic       intervention. RTK activation leads to autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues within       RTK intracellular domains and the consequent formation of docking sites for proteins       containing SH2 domains. One of the best characterized proteins of this class is Grb2, an       adapter protein that acts as a critical downstream intermediary in several oncogenic signaling       pathways. Originally isolated through screening for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)       interacting proteins, Grb2 associates with several other signaling and regulatory proteins.       Through its SH2 domain, which is a conserved sequence of approximately 100 amino acids, Grb2       can interact directly with RTKs and non-receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g. focal adhesion kinase       (FAK) and Bcr/Abl) by preferential binding to phosphopeptide motifs of the form pYXNX, where       pY represents phosphotyrosine, N is asparagine and X is any residue. The amino- and       carboxyl-terminal Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of Grb2, which have a conserved sequence of       around 50 amino acids, bind proline-rich regions within additional interacting proteins.       Through these two SH3 domains, Grb2 links activated RTKs with several key intracellular       regulatory networks, including the Ras/Erk pathway controlling cell cycle progression, and the       p21-activating kinase (PAK1) and Arp2/3/WASp pathways regulating the actin filament system,       cell shape change and motility. Grb2 is also a key intermediate of integrin signaling through       its interaction with activated FAK at pY925, which resides within the canonical recognition       motif for the Grb2 SH2 domain. Grb2-FAK binding triggers a signaling sequence involved in       angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), both of which are important       contributors to tumor progression. The critical roles served by Grb2 in cell motility and       angiogenesis make it a logical therapeutic target for pathological processes leading to the       spread of solid tumors through local invasion and metastasis. Based on the unique       three-dimensional structure of the Grb2 SH2 domain and its unique amino acid recognition       sequence, we designed and synthesized potent, synthetic, low molecular weight antagonists of       Grb2 SH2 domain binding. Since the cytosolic environment has a high level of constitutive       tyrosine phosphatase activity, stabilizing this moiety in vivo was a major challenge. We       initially achieved phosphatase resistance by replacing the pY residue with phosphonomethyl       phenylalanine, and we were the first to develop active compounds using non-phosphate       containing groups. Systematic substitution of the pYXN recognition motif led to high affinity       synthetic compounds that blocked RTK-Grb2 interactions in intact cells. Macrocyclization was       later used to stabilize the required beta-turn conformation, further improving       potency. 2. Defining the roles of Grb2 in oncogenesis and metastasis. In published and yet to       be published studies, we have shown that the Grb2 SH2 domain binding antagonists described       here potently block RTK-Grb2 interaction and growth factor-stimulated motility and matrix       invasion by several tumor cell lines, including those derived from RCC, prostate and bladder       cancer. More recently, we showed that HGF-induced Met-Grb2 binding and Grb2/FAK interaction       were significantly disrupted by these agents in intact cells, resulting in dramatically       reduced focal adhesion and lamellipodia formation in an aggressive human prostate cancer cell       line. These results defined a critical role for Grb2 in processes that are known to mediate       growth factor-stimulated cell motility. The same compounds also inhibited the basic       morphogenetic events required for angiogenesis, such as growth factor-driven endothelial cell       migration and matrix invasion. Moreover, inhibition of angiogenesis in an in vitro by human       endothelial cells, and suppression of vasculogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic assay,       further implicated Grb2 in pro-angiogenic pathways and reinforced the concept that its       blockade was a viable anti-angiogenesis strategy. 3. Preclinical development of SH2 domain       antagonists as anti-cancer drugs. Because Grb2 SH2 domain binding antagonists were found to be       highly effective in blocking cell motility, models of tumor metastasis were sought for the       preclinical development of these compounds in animals. Using a murine melanoma cell line in an       experimental metastasis model and a human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line in a spontaneous       metastasis model, in conjunction with bioluminescence technology to quantitate metastasis, a       significant reduction in metastatic burden was achieved using a prototypical Grb2 SH2 domain       binding antagonist. These results demonstrated that it was possible to specifically target the       spread of solid tumors using small molecules and it implied a critical role for the Grb2 SH2       domain in that process. Several important steps remain in the preclinical development of Grb2       SH2 domain binding antagonists as anti-cancer drugs. These compounds are among the first and       most successful antagonists of protein-protein interactions, however, defining target       selectivity and the molecular basis of therapeutic effects are important challenges to their       development and use. We believe that early and systematic exploration of these subjects will       profoundly improve the evaluation of drug toxicity, drug efficacy, and patient response. To       better understand the SH2 domain selectivity and mechanism of action, we developed       biotinylated derivatives of two biologically active structures and established that high       affinity Grb2 binding was fully retained. Selectivity was then investigated ligand via target       protein immobilization with streptavidin-coated beads and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.       Importantly, Grb2 was the only SH2-domain containing protein detected by MS among all proteins       captured from cell lysates. These results confirmed and extended our prior findings that these       structures selectively block the Grb2 SH2 domain and not other, structurally distinct SH2       domains. Initial pharmacokinetic studies of a Grb2 SH2 domain binding antagonist in mice       indicated that while it had a relative short biological half-life, target drug doses could be       maintained continuously using implanted osmotic minipumps. The systematic modification of our       compounds to improve half-life and bioavailability is a high priority for future development.       Similarly, while no toxicity was observed in mice treated for four weeks with doses designed       to exceed the ED50 by 100-fold, further toxicological studies are needed. Finally, the       development of pharmacodynamic markers of drug action in intact animals represents another       high priority in the preclinical development of our Grb2 SH2 domain antagonists. Global       analysis of gene expression in the presence and absence of treatment with selective Grb2 SH2       domain binding antagonists to identify a molecular signature is a logical approach that we       recently used to identify N-cadherin as a potential pharmacodynamic marker, and further       analysis along these lines is underway.","144999",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    
  
The theory that tumors originate from regions of chronic inflammation has recently received support from considerable evidence obtained from a series of animal and epidemiological studies. It is now apparent that there is an interplay between epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages, which is critical for progression of breast cancer. The key player that links inflammation to cancer is the transcription factor NF-?B, which regulates the expression of genes involved in proliferation, anti-apoptosis, invasion and metastasis. Constitutive activation of NF-?B in breast cancer has been well established by us and others. We have identified a number of signaling pathways that cause constitutive NF-?B activation in cancer cells including the action of cancer cell-derived IL-1a and heregulin. Our studies have shown that mammary tumor cell line derived from transgenic mice expressing her2/neu oncogene have markedly increased NF-?B activation and proliferation upon exposure to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). The latter is a major factor secreted by tumor associated macrophages and in so doing links inflammation to cancer. Recent studies have shown that inhibition of NF-?B in cancer cells using genetic approaches leads to conversion from TNF-induced proliferation to TRAIL-induced cancer cell death. Thus, inhibitors of NF-?B are ideal for preventing progression of pre-neoplastic lesions to cancer. As genetic ablation of NF-?B in cancer cells is not clinically possible, we have developed a water-soluble compound LC-1 with potent anti-NF-?B activity. The NCI's RAID program has confirmed that this agent has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile for clinical development and as such the compound will be tested in a phase I clinical trial for leukemia in 2007. The goal of this proposal is to define the chemopreventive potential of this compound in two animal models of breast cancer. We will test the hypothesis that by inhibiting NF-?B activity in pre-neoplastic lesions, LC-1 converts inflammation-induced tumor growth to inflammation-induced tumor regression through TRAIL. We also hypothesize that LC-1 will be particularly effective on inflammatory breast cancers, a rare but deadly form of breast cancer that is critically dependent on NF-?B for growth and survival. Two aims will test these hypotheses. Aim 1 will be to determine the effect of LC-1 on mammary tumor incidence, multiplicity and its effect on the angiogenic switch in the inducible MMTV-neu model of breast cancer. The second aim will be to define the ability of LC-1 to reduce growth and angiogenesis in an inflammatory model of breast cancer. For aim I, we will use the recently developed inducible transgenic model of breast cancer where activated neu is induced by treating 6.5 week old females with doxycycline. The resultant mammary tumors in these mice show a specific pattern of progression with hyperplasia followed by the angiogenic switch and then development of invasive carcinoma followed by lung metastasis. This model will allow us to test the effect of LC-1 on each of these stages and to evaluate the effect of LC-1 on the levels of different immune modulatory cells in the tumor microenvironment during different stages of breast cancer. For the inflammatory breast cancer model, we will use SUM149 cells implanted in nude mice as these cells are extremely sensitive to LC-1 mediated cell death. This study has the potential for translation to clinic because LC-1 has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile with no major toxicity in the preclinical toxicology studies. We propose that we will not completely eliminate but control NF-?B activity (similar to the approach with beta-blockers for cardiovascular diseases) so that normal activity of immune system is not compromised with LC-1 treatment.

(and Mexican Border) due to the unique arid nature of this environment. However, the results of
our studies are not limited to the Southwest since the main toxicants being examined, arsenic
and halogenated hydrocarbons, are ubiquitous throughout developed countries. Our Program
consists of 10 research projects - five biomedical projects and five environmental sciences
projects. Many of the projects are collaborative involving multiple disciplines. The biomedical
projects are examining the mechanism of arsenic toxicity in target tissues, factors that affect the
susceptibility of populations to arsenic-induced toxicity, and the effects of arsenic and TCE on
organ development. The environmental sciences projects are investigating how hazardous
wastes (arsenic, TCE/PCE) can be optimally characterized for remediation and innovative
techniques for containing or degrading these contaminants in our arid Southwest environment.
These research projects are supported by five Cores that: administer the Program, translate the
results to the stakeholders, provide research services, promote unique outreach efforts to

Selective tissue microdissection was used to obtain pure populations of GBM cells, which were studied using two-dimensional protein gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) and protein sequencing.   These molecular technique identified select target proteins that were expressed differentially among GBMs that permitted distinguishing between the 2 main categories of GBMs (primary and secondary). We isolated and sequenced 11 unique proteins that were differentially expressed in the primary and secondary GBMs and that produced 2 distinctive proteomic patterns. Thus, the 2 patterns of GBMs, primary versus secondary, previously distinguished by clinical and genetic differences, can be recognized at the protein level and may have implications for prognosis and treatment options. We are using the same approach to identify differentially expressed proteins in different stages of glioma formation, as well as within gliomas with different phenotypic expression.

 
Nuclear Receptor Corepressor (N-CoR) Expression in GBM. 
 
We have found that N-CoR is overexpressed in GBM cells.  Studies indicate that the subcellular localization and presence of N-CoR is related to the differentiation state of GBM cells.  Cells expressing nuclear N-CoR do not express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytic differentiation.  Cells with cytoplasmic N-CoR or loss of N-CoR express GFAP. N-CoR binds to unliganded nuclear receptors such as the retinoid acid receptor and thyroid hormone receptor. When N-CoR forms a complex with silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) and retinoic acid receptor, (RAR), transcription of RAR specific target genes is repressed resulting in increased cell proliferation.  We have found that oxadaic acid acts synergistically with retinoic acid (RA) to inhibit GBM cell growth and increase cell differentiation.  Phoshastase-1 inhibitors such as okadaic acid are known to inhibit N-CoR activity.  Oxadaic acid is not specifically targeted to N-CoR and is likely to have significant side-effects.  We believe these findings provide critical information for enhancing current understanding of glioma biology which may lead to new therapeutic options for patients. Therefore, we seek more specific phosphatase inhibitors from new chemical compounds that affect cell growth and differentiation in GBM by specifically targeting the NCo-R pathway, but not others. 

Recently a CRADA between Lixte Biotechonolgy Inc. and NINDS was executed for studying this novel therapeutic paradigm and developing new small chemical compounds.  Work is currently in progress studying the inhibitory activity of a series of phosphatase inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors.  LB1, a phosphatase inhibitor and LB 2, an HDAC inhibitor were developed and provided by our CRADA partner. During the last year, protocols for evaluating the new drugs and combinations of drugs for activities in an animal model of human GBM were jointly planned and developed. The results of the study show an inhibitory effect on tumor growth of the mouse xeno-grafted human GBM with both new compounds, LB1 and LB2. Recently, the chemical structure of these 2 compounds have been modified for a better penetration to the blood brain barrier.  We are planning to test these compounds in a GBM animal tumor model.


Identification of CNTF Receptor in Brain Tumors as Potential Diagnostic and Therapeutic Target. 
 
We used a more recently developed proteomic technique to distinguish the proteome of GBM stem cells by capillary isoelectric focusing (CIEF) with nano-reversed-phase liquid chromatography (nRPLC) peptide separation and MS/MS protein sequencing.  We have found that CNTF receptor protein consistently appeared in GBM proteomes but not in normal adult brain.  Subsequent studies indicated that its expression correlates with the pathologic grades of the glioma and their cell differentiation.  Taking CNTF receptor as an unique expression character in GBM stem cells and tissues and its membrane localization with large portion of protein extra-cellular distribution, we further studied antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in GBM cells.  The preliminary results of the study showed an inhibition of tumor cell growth and strong cellular cytotoxicity effect. We are planning to develop a CNTF receptor antibody specifically binding to CNTF receptor in brain tumor for therapeutic use, as well as potential molecular imaging marker. 


Developmental Biology and Tumorigenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). 
 
Analagous to other tumor supressor gene syndromes, tumorigenesis in VHL is most commonly initiated by a VHL wild-type deletion in susceptible cells. Several key questions, however, remain unexplained in most, if not all, tumor suppressor gene syndromes: 1) in any organ, only one specific type of tumor occurs; 2) tumorigenesis is restricted to specific sets of organs and 3) there is no obvious association between tumor suppressor gene function and tumorigenesis. Our recent studies on the histogenesis of hemangioblastomas revealed evidence that hemangioblastomas represent developmentally-arrested tissue. We have further established developmental effects of pVHL deficiency on central nervous system tissues by the discovery of numerous mesenchymal precursors that precede hemangioblastoma formation.  In analogy to embryonal blood island differentiation, blood island formation in hemangioblastomas is associated with transient expression of the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (EpoR). EpoR expression coincides with expression of Epo secondary to VHL deficiency, which we have recently proposed as a mechanism of tumor progression. This mechanism of tumor progression appears to be applicable to other VHL disease-associated tumors, including renal clear cell carcinoma and endolymphatic sac tumor. Current projects on VHL disease-associated hemangioblastomas include a) expression of developmental hemangioblast-associated proteins in hemangioblastomas, b) detailed characterization of hemangioblastoma precursor material, c) investigation of the vessel cell origin of hemangioblastoma by genetic analysis to address the critical questions whether the tumor cell participating directly to the angiogenesis. 
 
Based on the uniform expression of EPO and EPOR by VHL associated tumors and previous data indicating a potential EPO driven autocrine loop in these tumors, we attempted to establish the tumor cell line in culture conditions. The maintenance of tumor cells in culture requires an EPO-rich media.  Growth of the VHL tumor cells was disrupted by addition of EPO or EPOR antibodies in the culture media. Using EPO rich culture media, we cultured the primary tumors and maintained them in culture for in vitro testing. We have characterized and expanded these tumor cells to nucleated erythrocytes and mature erythrocytic progeny by varying the cell culture conditions. These findings further support that the EPO and EPOR functional pathway in these tumors is critical in VHL tumor growth and differentiation. Further, the established culture cell lines will be useful for testing other reagents.","1034055",

kidney tissue but is expressed at very high levels in dedifferentiated proximal tubule epithelial cells in human
and rodent kidneys after ischemic or toxic injury. The extracellular domain of KIM-1 is cleaved and can be
quantitated, by an ELISA assay, in the urine of rodents and patients with kidney injury or renal cell
carcinoma. An important feature common to repair of the tissue after injury (e.g. acute kidney injury, AKI) or
growth of cancer (e.g. renal cell carcinoma, RCC) is adequate supply of oxygen through formation of blood
vessels. This led us to hypothesize that the function of KIM-1 ectdomain is to activate the endothelial cells by
paracrine mechanisms and stimulate angiogenesis. In the preliminary results we found that KIM-1
ectodomain binds to endothelial cells and stimulates migration in a chemotactic and chemoattractant
manner. Furthermore, KIM-1 also induced a 2-fold increase in the number of new blood vessels in the in vivo
matrigel plug assay indicating its role in neovascularization.
The objective of this proposal is to investigate the mechanisms involved in endothelial repair stimulated by
KIM-1 following kidney toxicity due to drugs or environmental toxicants. In the first specific aim the
expression of soluble KIM-1 will be characterized in relation with other biomarkers involved in endothelial
repair process after kidney injury using various in vivo preclinical and clinical models of kidney toxicity. The
second aim of this proposal is to investigate the mechanism of angiogenesis by KIM-1 in the context of
endothelial cell regeneration by conducting structure function studies to identify the critical domain of KIM-1
responsible for endothelial cell survival, migration, tube formation and new blood vessel growth. We will also
investigate if KIM-1 stimulates migration by inducing candidate gene expression further activating Rho and
Integrin linked kinase pathways to cause chemotaxis. We will determine the critical role of KIM-1 in
angiogenesis and endothelial resurtucturing by ""Knock-in"" and ""Knockout"" strategies using Kim-1 transgenic
mice that overexpresses KIM-1 selectively on the epithelial cells of the embryonic and adult kidney proximal
tubules and investigate if these mice have faster and more effective endothelial regeneration and recovery
from kidney toxicity. Consequently, we will also use the KIM-1 knockout mice to determine if they are more
susceptible to nephrotoxicity owing to the lack of repair.
Since kidney is a major target for toxicity due to chemical annd physical agents, unraveling the
mechanisms of how KIM-1 regulates growth of blood vessels would offer treatment paradigms to promote (in
AKI) or inhibit (in kidney cancer) angiogenesis to ameliorate or perhaps even cure disorders that are leading
causes of mortality today.","244020",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tobacco smoking increases the risk of chronic pulmonary inflammation and lung cancer development. Much effort has been placed on identification of chemical carcinogens in tobacco smoke and monitoring their presence in smokers. However, not all smokers who are exposed to equivalent amounts of such carcinogens develop cancer. There is also a great variation in latency of lung cancer between individuals that do develop the disease. This suggests the existence of additional factors that contribute to the etiology of lung cancer. While genetic factors are likely to be of importance, based on our recent work showing a critical role for inflammation in other types of chemically-induced cancers, we propose that pulmonary inflammation is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Pulmonary inflammation may also accelerate the metastatic spread of lung cancer, thereby making more than one contribution to the lethal nature of this disease. We propose that activation of the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-?B provides a link between chronic pulmonary inflammation caused by repetitive exposure to tobacco smoke and development and progression of lung cancer. We will use a conditional disruption of the gene encoding IKK¿, a catalytic subunit of the I?B kinase (IKK) complex required for NF-?B activation, to determine the role of IKK¿-dependent NF-?B signaling in experimental lung carcinogenesis based on combined exposure to a chemical carcinogen and tobacco smoke. We will also use a conditional IKK¿ deletion in myeloid cells to determine the contribution of NF-?B-driven inflammatory activation of cells such as alveolar macrophages to lung cancer development and progression. To circumvent the low efficiency of lung cancer induction by chemical carcinogens and its strong dependence on a particular genetic background we will also use transgenic models in which lung cancer is initiated by expression of K-ras or Raf-1 and will examine whether development and progression of these tumors is accelerated by tobacco smoke inhalation and other forms of pulmonary inflammation. In addition, we will use an experimental metastasis model based on orthotopic injections of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells to examine the contribution of inflammatory processes triggered either by exposure to tobacco smoke or by rapidly growing lung tumors to the metastatic spread of lung cancer. We will place special emphasis on the role of the innate immune system in the metastatic process and compare its activation by tobacco smoke inhalation to its activation by factors released by lung cancer cells. The proposed studies will provide critical and much needed information regarding the role of inflammation in lung carcinogenesis and tumor progression and should lay the foundation for anti-inflammatory therapy in prevention and treatment of lung cancer, the most prevalent cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.

Macrovascular disease initiates at pre-clinical phases of impaired glucose metabolism, & rate-limiting repair of diseased matrix may prolong clinical responses. The ability to cure or substantially reverse diabetic macrovascular disease (DMAC) represents an unmet clinical need. A better understanding of the pathobiology during initiation and progression is required. DMAC is a vascular inflammatory state affecting adventitial, medial, intimal, and valvular compartments. Calcification is a key component of DMAC that reduces vascular compliance, and increases mortality and risk for lower extremity amputation. Medial, intimal, and valve calcification are more prevalent in diabetic patients, worsened by progressive renal insufficiency. Paracrine & endocrine signals act on vascular myofibroblasts to regulate an early osteogenic phase of vascular calcification. A pro-osteogenic gene regulatory program - a ""feed-forward"" BMP2-Msx2- Wnt signaling cascade - is activated in aortic myofibroblasts by diabetes and dyslipidemia (LDLR-/- mice). Surprisingly, the bone anabolic agent PTH(1-34) suppresses vascular calcification while enhancing orthotopic bone formation. We now extend our studies of vascular calcification as regulated by endocrine & paracrine cues. Under Aim 1, we examine the role for the cytokine osteopontin in inhibition & potential reversal of vascular calcification by PTH{1-34). We test if PTH(1-34) inhibits the proliferative expansion and osteogenic commitment of vascular mesenchymal progenitors in vivo. Under Aim 2, SM22-PTH1 R(H223R) transgenic mice will test whether vascular myofibroblast PTH1R activation (a) suppresses vascular calcification; and (b) inhibits vascular Msx2-Wnt signaling cascades in vivo as it does in vitro. Under Aim 3, we test whether the enhanced aortic Msx2-Wnt signaling in our Msx2 transgenic mice pre-disposes animals to vascular calcification as predicted from in vitro studies, either alone or in synergy with vascular BMP2.","362679",

For these studies       we used the highly metastatic MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cell line. PRL and its receptors       have been identified in normal and cancerous human breast tissues and cell lines; however,       much of the evidence implicating a role for PRL in mammary tumorigenesis is from rodent       models. The extent of PRLs involvement in human breast cancer is less well documented. To       evaluate the role autocrine PRL plays in tumor growth, progression, and metastasis, we stably       transfected 435 cells with a human prolactin cDNA. We found that PRL confers a more aggressive       phenotype in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, it inhibited apoptosis and increased mitogenesis on       plastic and on extracellular matrices, enhanced growth on soft agar and increased cell       migration. In vivo, overexpression of PRL increased tumorigenesis in an orthotopic xenograft       model. Microarray analyses, confirmed by immunohistochemistry, revealed that PRL       differentially regulated various members of the Wnt pathway resulting in increased Wnt       signaling. The Wnt inhibitor Dkk-1 reversed the growth promoting effects of PRL. This is the       first evidence demonstrating that PRL acts through activation of the canonical Wnt pathway. We       also have examined the role that the Hox-related homeobox-containing gene, Msx2, plays during       branching morphogenesis and tumorigenesis where our studies in vivo and in vitro showed that P       in the presence of E regulates its expression. Mining of published databases found a strong       correlation between elevated MSX2 expression and estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast       cancer. Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a process occurring during both       embryogenesis and early stages of invasive cancer. Epithelial cells that undergo EMT become       more migratory and invasive with a mesenchymal morphology. We assessed EMT induction in a       mouse mammary epithelial cell line driven by Msx2. NMuMG cells, a normal mouse mammary       epithelial cell line, stably-transfected with a Msx2 cDNA showed downregulation of an       epithelial marker E-cadherin and upregulation of the mesenchymal markers vimentin and       N-cadherin. Furthermore, overexpression of Cripto-1, a member of the epidermal growth       factor-CFC protein family already known to be involved in EMT, was detected in       Msx2-transfected cells. The expression of Cripto-1 was accompanied by activation of the       tyrosine kinase c-Src pathway and an increase in the invasive ability of the cells. Functional       assays also demonstrated inhibition of the invasive behavior of the Msx2-transfected cells by       a c-Src specific inhibitor. Moreover, immunohistochemistry of human infiltrating breast       carcinomas showed positive staining for Msx2 only in the infiltrating tumor cells while the       non-infiltrating tumor cells were negative. These results suggest that Msx2 may play a       significant role in promoting EMT in epithelial cells that acquire properties involved in       tumor invasion. MSX2 is also an important downstream component of the ras gene signaling       pathway. Most pancreatic cancers harbor a K-ras gene mutation. In collaboration with Dr. Satoh       in Sendai, Japan, we also showed that MSX-2 was expressed in four human pancreatic cancer cell       lines and in 23 of 32 (71.8 %) of human pancreatic carcinoma tissues as determined by RT-PCR       and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Increased expression of MSX2 was significantly       correlated with higher tumor grade. BxPC3 cells stably expressing MSX2 showed a flattened and       scattered morphology accompanied by a change in localization of E-cadherin and       beta-catenin from membrane to cytoplasm. Cell proliferation rate, cell migration and       anchorage independent cell growth were enhanced in MSX2 expressing cells. MSX2 expressing       cells also show significantly more frequent liver metastases and disseminations in nude mice       than did control cells when cells were injected into the pancreas. In addition, microarray       analysis revealed a significant induction of Twist 1 by MSX2. Twist 1 expression was       significantly associated with MSX2 expression in human pancreatic carcinomas and was       down-regulated in MSX2 pancreatic cancer cells by transfected with a small interfering RNA       expressing vector to inactivate MSX2. Taken together these data indicate that MSX2 plays a       crucial role in pancreatic cancer cell development by leading pancreatic cancer cells to a       state consistent with EMT through enhanced expression of Twist 1. Utilizing our knowledge of       the MSX homeobox genes, we examined the role of the homeobox-containing gene, BP-1, in human       breast cancer. In collaboration with Dr. Pat Berg of George Washington University who showed       this gene to be more prevalent in breast cancer from African American women vs. Caucasians,       and over-expressed in all ER negative breast cancers examined, We examined the role of BP1 in       aggressiveness using MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines stably overexpressing BP1 (MCF-BP1). Four       assays were used to predict aggressiveness: serum independent growth, anchorage independent       growth, invasion potential, and tumorigenesis in mice. MCF-BP1 cells were more aggressive by       all four assays; tumors were larger in mice injected with BP1 cells than in mice injected with       control cells. MCF-BP1 cells developed tumors in mice in the absence of estrogen, while       control cells only produced tumors in the presence of estrogen supplementation, indicating       that high-level BP1 expression can confer estrogen independence. One mechanism of estrogen       independence is repression of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) gene. We show that pBP1 binds       to the first intron of the ER gene and that MCF-BP1 cells are more frequently ER negative by       immunostaining than control cells, suggesting that BP1 may repress the ER. Moreover, in the       presence of increased BP1 levels, tumor size was increased in human breast carcinoma as well       as in mice. Microarray analysis demonstrated increased expression of genes involved in       angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, including c-FOS, MET, TWIST and MMP9. Thus, by all       measures we examined, overexpression of BP1 confers a more aggressive phenotype on breast       cancer cells, making BP1 a strong potential therapeutic target. Expression of BP-1 in breast       cancer cells is regulated by PRL.","750878",

Our prior clinical studies with the humanized CD52-specific monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab indicate that aggressive perioperative T-cell depletion does not reduce the risk of early allograft rejection, and treatment must be accompanied by other immunosuppressive agents.  Unlike the pro-tolerant effect seen in animal models, alemtuzumab treatment is associated with a novel form of rejection that is macrophage rich and associated with the presence of a specific T-cell type, the effector memory T cell, which is resistant to depletion.  In vitro studies have shown that calcineurin inhibitors uniquely prevent the activity of this cell type and we have now shown in a pilot clinical trial that the combination of depletion with a single low dose of the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus prevents rejection in humans without the need for steroids or multi drug immunosuppression. In addition to attenuating the activity of effector memory T cells, calcineurin inhibition also appears to limit the liberation of critical chemokines from the allograft, and thus tacrolimus may have unrecognized effects of immune chemotaxis as well as T cell activation.  Understanding the role of these effector memory T cells, their resistance to depletion, and the role of homeostatic proliferation in limiting tolerance induction will provide additional mechanistic insights into the development of tolerance in humans.
2.	Theoretically, tacrolimus appears to limit adaptive immune processes like activation induced cell death that may be required for the development of allograft tolerance. It is also nephrotoxic, a significant issue when considering renal transplantation. The mTOR inhibitor sirolimus has been suggested to be a better long term agent as it is less nephrotoxic, and may foster specific elimination of graft specific T cells. However, we have shown that sirolimus as a sole agent is a sub-optimal drug for preventing post-depletional rejection. We have therefore initiated a clinical trial that combines tacrolimus and sirolimus until the risk of early rejection has decreased (approximately 6 months). Patients are then randomized to wean to either tacrolimus or sirolimus. We are now accruing patients to this trial to determine if the early use of dual therapy followed by weaning to monotherapy will favor adaptive tolerance without risking early rejection. We are specifically comparing patients that have been successfully weaned to monotherapy tacrolimus or sirolimus to determine if the predicted benefits and drawbacks of each agent are seen in humans as predicted by prior animal study. Initial results suggest equal efficacy in preventing rejection in both arms but a trend toward increasing donor-specific hyporesponsiveness in the sirolimus arm, as detected by ELISPOT and mixed lymphocyte responses.
3.	We have investigated the use of quantitative PCR-based technologies to more precisely delineate immune activity in renal allografts compared to histology and serve as a tool to improve the diagnostic evaluation of allograft recipients. The diagnosis of acute cellular rejection (ACR) is typically made histologically. However, many patients with histological rejection have normal renal function. The significance of this so-called sub-clinical rejection (SCR) has not been defined. The treatment of SCR is particularly controversial in tolerance trials, as treatment might disrupt potentially salutary regulation. We have developed a PCR-based platform that allows for quantitative quadruplicate analysis of 96 transcripts in quadruplicate (384 wells) from 100ng of total RNA template in approximately 3 hours. To evaluate the utility of this method, and establish a baseline for standard transplant pathology to which tolerance trials can be compared, we have characterized most states relevant to renal transplantation in patients undergoing standard immunosuppression, and correlated findings to histology. We have nowidentified 3 genes that have strong correlation with the functional significance of a rejection episode. These are Fas ligand, the TH1 transcription factor Tbet and CD152. We are now establishing a prospective trial to investigate the use of molecular monitoring to improve post transplant immune management and are extending the use of this transcriptional technique to other graft pathologies.  We have demonstrated that BK virus nephropathy is associated with a strong, cytotoxic T cell response, not unlike that of acute rejection, but of larger magnitude.  Moreover, biopsies with BK virus have strong induction of genes associated with renal graft fibrosis and epithelial mesenchymal transformation.  These findings have supported additional mechanistic studies, reported in Z01 DK062008-05.  Our studies in transplant glomerulopathy also indicate marked immunologic activation, well in advance of clinical disease, and we are in the process of identifying if there are unique pathways that can be disrupted to ameliorate graft disease.  Transcriptome patterning will also be studied in the coming year in native kidneys of recipients of other solid organs as well as in pancreas and small bowel transplants.
4.	We have also initiated studies investigating the utility of quantitative viral replication assessment in determining ones overall degree of immunosuppression. We have determined that most transplant recipients have active replication for the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) and that this exceeds that seen in non-transplanted individuals both qualitatively and quantitatively. By establishing a norm for EBV replication we have been able to determine parameters for over and under immunosuppression and have been able to correlate this with the risk for rejection of over immunosuppression. Similarly, we have shown that utilizing BK viruria as a marker of over-immunosuppression, patients have been assessed prospectively and immunosuppression withdrawn under close surveillance.  Resolution of significant viruria is almost universal and acute rejection in these circumstances is less likely.  
5.	Our collaborative trial with NHGRI 04-DK-0057 (Renal transplantation in recipients with nephropathic cystinosis) has enrolled 10 patients.  We have transplanted four patients, and the remaining are being followed with progressive chronic kidney disease.  These patients demonstrate reduced T cell memory to common antigens, perhaps in part due to the fact that most are younger recipients (< 18 yo).  We also demonstrate the relative safety and efficacy of steroid free immunosuppression in a young adult and pediatric population that is not sensitized.  Cystinosis, however, requires continued treatment after transplantation, and there appears to be no significant drug interaction between cystagon and other post-transplant medications.
6.	In addition to cellular assays such as mixed lymphocyte response, peripheral leukocyte transcription, flow cytometry to assess the presence of memory cell subpopulations and regulatory T cells, ELISPOT detected IFN-gamma to alloantigen, and measurement of donor specific antibody by luminex, we have prospectively analyzed PHA-stimulated ATP production in CD4+ T cells, as well as memory antigen stimulated responses.  This work demonstrates that it is 12 times more likely to develop infection in recipients with low values for ATP production ( 25 ng/ml).  Similarly, high levels of stimulated ATP production ( 700 ng/ml) are 30 times more likely to reject.  Memory stimulated ATP responses are significantly lower and are lost during the first 6 months of induction.  Repopulated T cells are quite active as demonstrated by the relatively high per cell production of ATP.  We are continuing to analyze our single center data to address the impact of immunosuppression and to monitor repopulation activity after depletion.","831422",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  
Following ischemic injury, dedifferentiated cells appear to migrate into regions of denuded basement membrane, repopulate and repair the injured tubule. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) expression is markedly upregulated in surviving proximal epithelial cells in post-ischemic injury and in the dedifferentiated and dividing cells at the free edge of the wound in an in vitro ""scratch-induced injury"" model. The ectodomain of KIM-1 is cleaved and can be detected in the urine of patients with acute tubular injury. It can also be detected in the culture medium of cells expressing this protein. KIM-1 expression results in increased binding of bone marrow cells to renal epithelial cells. The chemokine, stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1) is constitutively expressed in bone marrow stromal cells and kidney. Studies reported decreased expression of SDF-1 and an increased expression of CXCR4 in renal cell carcinoma, indicating CXCR4, like KIM-1, is overexpressed in dedifferentiated cells. Many studies have shown that SDF-1/CXCR4 interactions play an important role in stem cell homing in the bone marrow. It has been shown recently that bone marrow cells (BMCs) contribute to repair of the ischemically injured renal tubule. We have found that after bone marrow transplantation in which x-gal-positive BMCs injected into an irradiated host mouse, x-gal positive cells were found in the recipient kidney that express proximal tubular marker gp330 after renal I/R-induced injury, suggesting BMCs can migrate to the injured site and differentiate into renal epithelial cells. Our preliminary studies in vitro showed that GFP-labeled BMCs in a scratch-induced injury model demonstrated morphological changes and a significant increase of GFP-positive cells at the site of scratch injury. These results suggest KIM-1 may play roles on homing of BMCs in renal injury. Nevertheless, the mechanism of BMCs homing is not fully understood. We will focus on studying the: (1) functional role of KIM-1 in homing of BMCs in injured renal tubule; (2) functional role of SDF-1/CXCR4 in homing of BMCs in injured renal tubule as well as the relationships between KIM-1 and SDF-1/CXCR4; (3) differential gene expression using DNA microarrays to determine the transcriptional program that coordinates migration and repopulation of BMCs. This study may provide new insight on the role of KIM-1 and BMCs in renal tubular injury. KIM-1 may be important in the process of BMC homing.

Cumulative evidence implicates NF-kappaB in cell survival, inflammation, angiogenesis, spread and therapeutic resistance during tumor development, progression and metastasis of carcinomas. Non-specific natural and synthetic agents that inhibit NF-kappaB have demonstrated activity and safety in prevention or therapy. NF-kappaB-activating kinases and the proteasome are under investigation for targeted prevention and therapy of carcinoma.

During this period, we reported on molecular correlative studies from our phase I clinical trial of proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with reirradiation for patients with recurrent HNSCC (01-C-0104; ref. 2). The canonical (NF-kappaB1/RELA or cREL) and alternate (NF-kappaB2/RELB) pathways require the proteasome for cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation. However, limited clinical activity of bortezomib has been observed in many epithelial malignancies, suggesting this could result from incomplete inhibition of NF-kappaB/RELs or other prosurvival signal pathways. HNSCC showed increased nuclear staining for all five NF-kappaB subunits, phosphorylated ERK1/2, and phosphorylated STAT3. Bortezomib treatment significantly enhanced apoptosis with inhibition of nuclear RELA in three of four tumors, but other NF-kappaB subunits, ERK1/2, and STAT3 were variably or not affected, and tumor progression was observed within 3 months. In HNSCC cell lines, 10(-8) mol/L bortezomib inhibited cell density while inhibiting tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced and partially inhibiting basal activation of NF-kappaB1/RELA, but not NF-kappaB2/RELB. We conclude that although low-dose bortezomib inhibits activation of subunits of the canonical pathway, it does not block nuclear activation of the noncanonical NF-kappaB or other prosurvival signal pathways, which may contribute to the heterogeneous responses observed in HNSCC. Overall, 5/17 patients treated at the initial dose level demonstrated partial responses. This study continues accrual at the next dose level to define the maximally tolerated dose with the new schedule that provides a two week break from drug treatment. 

Limited drug penetration in tumors is another problem affecting clinical responsiveness. In a collaborative study with the Department of Radiology, it was found that pulsed high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) could enhance apoptosis and growth inhibition of squamous cell carcinoma xenografts with proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (3). We found that treatment of tumors with pulsed HIFU lowered the threshold level for efficacy of bortezomib, resulting in significant tumor cytotoxicity and growth inhibition at lower dose levels. HIFU in combination with Bortezomib may warrant investigation for control of inoperable local regional disease.

A third potential limitation of therapy with drugs such as Bortezomib is the nature of the dynamic response of the targeted pathway to inhibition. In a collaborative study with Dr. Myong-Hee Sung and colleagues of the Laboratory of Receptor Biology, NCI, the dynamic Effect of Bortezomib on NF-kappaB Activity and Gene Expression in Tumor Cells was investigated (4). When administered to pre-activated cells, the drug gave rise to distinct inhibition dynamics, with discrete pulses of reporter induction remaining for hours. These findings suggest that, contrary to a simplistic presumption for a pathway 'blockade', the network dynamics and the intracellular pharmacokinetics of the inhibitor must be critically evaluated in developing strategies for optimal intervention of oncogenic pathways.

We wrote an invited commentary for a study based on our previous and continued studies on the role of Inhibitor-kappaB kinases in HNSCC (5). We have obtained evidence that IKK1 (IKKalpha)and IKK 2 (IKKbeta) both contribute to activation of NF-kappaB, and identified a role for protein kinase CK2 in IKK/NF-kappaB activation (Yu et al., Cancer Res., 2006; Van Waes, Clin Cancer Res. 2007). Studies are underway to determine if classical (IKK1/2 NF-kappaB1) and alternative (IKK1 NF-kappaB2) pathways are activated and contribute to gene expression and malignant phenotype of HNSCC, and may be inhibited by known and newly developed agents. In their study, Maeda et al. reported that loss or decreased nuclear expression of IKKalpha occurs in 20 of 64 ( 33%) of oral SCCs and is significantly associated with decreased histologic differentiation and prognosis. Their data indicate that besides its role in NF-kB activation, nuclear IKKalpha may play a role in differentiation, suppressing development of poorly differentiated  SCC. Such loss of nuclear IKKalpha is associated with decreased differentiation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition, a phenotype linked with SCC progression, invasion, and worse prognosis. The possible effects of IKK inhibitors in inhibiting versus promoting malignant potential merit investigation.
 
Our collaboration was sought by colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh NCI SPORE in helping characterize survival signaling related to autocrine and paracrine chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) activation in head and neck cancer, which may relate to NF-kappaB and Akt. CCR7 mediates survival and invasiveness of metastatic HNSCC to regional lymph nodes. Constitutive prosurvival signaling by the phosphoinositide-3 kinase/Akt pathway has been observed in cells independent of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. In the absence of exogenous ligand treatment, blockade of CCR7 signaling reduced levels of phosphorylated (activated) Akt and decreased HNSCC cell viability, enhancing the effect of EGFR inhibition. CCR7 stimulation protected metastatic HNSCC cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis in an Akt-dependent manner. Metastatic nodes expressed and secreted higher levels of CCL19 than benign nodes or primary tumors. CCR7-positive murine SCCHN tumors grew more slowly in plt mice than in control BALB/c mice. Thus, secretion of CCL19 and CCL21 by SCCHN cells and by paracrine sources combine to promote activation of CCR7 prosurvival signaling associated with tumor progression and disease relapse. CCR7 and its cognate chemokines may be useful biomarkers of SCCHN progression, and blockade of CCR7-mediated signaling may enhance the efficacy of platinum- and EGFR-based therapies.","606727",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   
We request partial funding support for operation of the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Phosphorylation and G protein Signaling Networks. This conference, formerly known as ""Second Messengers and Protein Phosphorylation"" has been held annually since 1970, and has been a premier venue for the presentation of new discoveries in signal transduction. Investigators who initiated and attended this meeting from its inception were leaders who established the field of signal transduction, including several who have received Nobel Prizes (e.g., Earl Sutherland, Al Oilman, Stanley Cohen, Edwin Krebs, Edmond Fischer, Paul Nurse). The conference focuses on signal transduction mechanisms that regulate cell growth, differentiation, survival, and metabolism. A full understanding of these signaling mechanisms is scientifically and clinically important because their failure plays a direct role in contemporary health problems that affect millions of people worldwide, such as diabetes, obesity, cancer, aging, infectious disease, cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, and developmental disorders. Meeting topics cover networks of intracellular signaling pathways from a mechanistic viewpoint, and continue to highlight cutting edge discoveries by emerging from studies focused on protein covalent modifications, protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, and control by small molecule effectors. The University of New England became the new site for this meeting in 2005, and provides a rustic and handicapped-accessible venue to promote open interaction among participants. The 2006 meeting will be held from Sunday night June 11 and end on Thursday evening June 16. The speakers are encouraged to integrate biochemical, structural, cell-biological, and genomic approaches that provide a comprehensive understanding of the molecular aspects of signaling mechanisms as they relate to disease. Two plenary speakers were selected to set the stage for the conference and to challenge the participants to think about signal transduction from perspectives of the chemistry-biology interface. The conference will consist of 8 sessions, each with a discussion leader and 3-5 speakers, selected from investigators who have made important recent contributions. At least 45% of the invited speakers are either women or members of minority groups and 23% of invited speakers are new investigators (Asst/Assoc. level). Speakers in each session will develop the important paradigms in signal transduction. The emphasis will be on structural and functional understanding of the defining molecular mechanisms and their implications for disease and potential treatment strategies. The co-chairs will select 135 participants from applicants, including representatives from industry and academia, senior scientists, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. A special effort will be made to recruit minority participants and participants from industry by a direct emailing program. Participants will be encouraged to present posters on new and interesting results each afternoon. Importantly, the conference provides a forum for young investigators to see the connection between fundamental scientific inquiry and the application of scientific methods to the design of efficacious interventions for human disease. To emphasize this goal, 8 poster presentations that complement the themes of the meeting will be selected for short oral presentations during the main sessions.

DESCRIPTION (adapted from the applicant's abstract):  Washington University has been a CALGB main member institution since 1986.  Over the last five years, the cancer research program at the Washington University Medical Center (WUMC) has experienced tremendous growth.  Barnes-Jewish Hospital, the largest hospital in St. Louis, diagnoses more than 5,400 patients a year with cancer and remains the major referral center for southeast Missouri and southern Illinois.  The Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) at WUMC received NCI-designated Cancer Center status in August 2001.  The infrastructure developed by the SCC to compete successfully for the NCI Cancer Center Support Grant has significantly enhanced our ability to carry out all aspects of clinical cancer research, including cooperative group trials.  Our recent efforts to expand institutional research studies will significantly enhance our ability to contribute concepts to CALGB during the next grant cycle, specifically in the areas of Hematologic malignancies, thoracic oncology, and pharmacogenomics.  Between 1998 and 2002, 16 Washington University physicians and research assistants served on 36 different CALGB scientific and administrative committees.  WUMC investigators chaired 12 CALGB studies, including Phase II studies in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, mesothelioma, and several pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic correlative science studies.  Six additional studies are in the final stages of development.  Accrual to CALGB trials has continued to increase during this grant period, with an average of 183 patients per year registered to therapeutic and non-therapeutic trials from 1998 to 2001.  Accrual to therapeutic trials increased from 61 patients in 1998 to 105 in 2001.  Based on registrations to date, projected accrual to CALGB trials for 2002 is estimated to be 312, with 136 to therapeutic studies.  Plans for the next grant cycle include 1) continued involvement by all current WUMC investigators, 2) increased participation by our Phase I investigators to facilitate development of Phase II studies within CALGB, 3) involvement of at least five additional WUMC investigators in CALGB activities including faculty interested in GU oncology, quality of life, stem cell transplant and leukemia, leukemia correlative sciences, and radiation oncology, and 5) continued efforts to increase accruals, particularly minority accruals, to CALGB trials.

renewal of a midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented
research (K24CA82450). The PI is Randall F. Holcombe, MD. This application details the experience,
qualifications and short- and long-term patient-oriented research plans of Dr. Holcombe, as well as reviews
progress during the period of support under the current award. Details about current and planned patient-
oriented research is provided. These studies are focused on patient-oriented research in colon cancer and
include studies related to the Wnt signaling pathway, elucidation of immunologic events in conjunction with
administration of chemotherapy for colon cancer and definition of the mechanisms and potential therapeutic
and cancer preventive effects of resveratrol, a naturally occuring compound found in the skin of grapes.
Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, having or at high risk for colon cancer, are also studied. An
additional clinical trial with laboratory correlative studies, originally designed and written by a mentee
hematology-oncology fellow of Dr. Holcombe's involves the treatment of patients with gastric cancer.
Mentoring activity over the past 5 years and mentoring plans for the next 5 years are described. The
accomplishments of mentees are outlined as are their current activities, espeicially as related to ongoing
participation in patient-oriented research. Ongoing mentoring plans include formal coursework,
basic/translational research experiences, instruction in the development and implementation of clinical
research trials, and hands-on experiences in clinical research. The original goals and objectives of the
current award are reviewed and the extent to which these have been achieved is delineated. Documentation
of institutional support and justification of the need for continued support through the K24 mechanism is
provided.","149580",
