play an important role in cardiac left-right development. Evidence from model organisms, such as in zebrafish
organ of asymmetry, (Kupffer’s Vesicle, KV) indicates that conserved cilia-driven leftward flow establishes left-
right signals to regulate target genes to control asymmetric heart morphogenesis. While events downstream of
leftward flow have received much attention, little is known about how the organ of asymmetry is formed and the
biology of the ciliated cells that generate fluid flow. This project addresses the broad question: How do ciliated
cells develop into a functional polarized organ? To address this question we are bringing together cell biology
and developmental biology to investigate how the cytokinetic bridge establishes apical polarity and a lumen in
vivo. We propose that this occurs through a sequential process that starts with cell division and placement of
the cytokinetic midbody, which marks a site for where the apical membrane should be placed. Cytokinetic
bridge resolution (a.k.a. abscission) results in the separation of two daughter cells following mitosis allowing for
the cell to initiate ciliogenesis. This process has important implications in embryogenesis, and broad
implications in the role of cytokinesis in developing cellular diversity. While abscission has been examined in
vitro, little has been done to examine the role of cytokinesis/abscission in epithelial establishment and de novo
lumen formation in vivo. Thus, our work will test the overall hypothesis that cell division is an essential
process that initiates lumen formation, ciliogenesis, and subsequently tissue morphogenesis. Here we propose
to examine in the zebrafish KV a requirement for abscission in the transition of progenitor-mesenchymal-like
migratory cells to epithelial-ciliated cells (tested in Aim 1). For instance, does cell division trigger KV-specific
apical polarity protein expression and does division contribute to how cells are patterned to form a KV? We
propose that following cytokinesis, daughter cells stay interconnected by a cytokinetic bridge while apical
polarity is established. This process requires targeted membrane traffic into the cytokinetic bridge. During this
time, the two daughter cells position themselves so that the cytokinetic bridge is placed where an apical
membrane and lumen will form. Once the bridge is cleaved, a lumen is initiated (Aim 2) and KV cells can form
primary cilia (Aim 3). We will use photoconversion to track cell fate following division, and laser ablation or
optogenetics to determine whether abscission timing is important for apical polarity, cilia formation, and
lumenogenesis. These studies will identify important mechanisms for de novo tissue morphogenesis.","270000",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can develop into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes, providing
materials for regenerative medicine. In particular, bone-related applications of MSCs is one of the most promising
clinical applications of MSCs. The PI recently found that Fkbp4, a member of the FK506-binding protein (Fkbp)
family of peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIase), promotes MSC differentiation into osteoblasts. They also found that
Fkbp4 interacts with the Mettl3 complex, which induces the novel RNA modification called N6-methyladenosine
(m6A). Although m6A is known to be involved in MSC differentiation, exact roles and mechanisms remain largely
unknown. Through a genome-wide approach, PI found thousands of mRNAs modified by m6A in MSCs,
osteoblasts, and adipocytes. The mRNAs included critical transcription factor genes for the differentiation as well
as several histone modifying enzyme genes. In addition, they found that Fkbp4 activates the Mettl3 complex in
a PPIase domain-dependent manner. Based on these findings, the PI hypothesized that Fkbp4 activates the
Mettl3 complex by isomerization of one of its subunits during osteoblast differentiation. They also hypothesized
that m6A modifications promote osteoblast differentiation by modulating RNA metabolism with a result of
increased protein levels of the genes. The PI will test these hypotheses with the following three aims. In Aim 1,
the PI will map m6A distributions in the transcriptome of MSCs, osteoblasts, and adipocytes at a single nucleotide
level. Subsequently, they will inhibit the methylation in a sequence-specific manner to understand causal
relationships between m6A and RNA metabolism. Aim 2 will investigate bone phenotypes of Fkbp4 knockout
mice and also study how m6A of osteoblast genes affect their differentiation. Aim 3 will study m6A modification
of Fkbp4 mRNA as a feedback between Fkbp4 and Mettl3. In addition, this aim will investigate how Fkbp4
expression is inhibited during adipocyte differentiation by glucocorticoid receptor. Collectively, these studies will
demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism of Mettl3 by Fkbp4 and how m6A modifications controls MSC
differentiation. These findings are expected to promote MSC-based regenerative medicine.","272667",

Once thought to be a mere consequence of the state of the cell, metabolism is now known to play a critical role
in dictating cell differentiation. Non-oxidative glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) are the two
sources of intracellular ATP. Factors that increase osteoblast activity and bone mass such as the Hypoxia-
Inducible Factor 1a (HIF1) have been shown to activate non-oxidative glycolysis. In vitro osteogenic
differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors increases both non-oxidative glycolysis and OxPhos. However, the
role of OxPhos in osteoblast biology in vivo is largely unexplored. To fill this gap in knowledge, we generated a
mutant mouse lacking Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM) in uncommitted mesenchymal progenitors
and their descendants (PRX;TFAMf/f). TFAM regulates transcription of the mitochondrial genes that encode
thirteen subunits of the electron transport chain and thus controls OxPhos. Analysis of 3-week-old PRX;TFAMf/f
bones revealed the presence of a severe low bone mass phenotype with spontaneous fractures in mutants.
Our data thus indicate that mesenchymal TFAM is necessary for bone mass accrual. In addition, we provided
preliminary evidence that loss of TFAM inhibits the in vitro differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells
(BMSCs) into osteoblasts and significantly reduces their intracellular levels of ATP. Impairment of OxPhos is
the most powerful, consistent and best characterized biological consequence of loss of TFAM across
numerous cell types."" "" However, TFAM also regulates duplication of mitochondrial DNA, and mitochondria have
functions that go beyond OxPhos and ATP production. Therefore, to establish if the impairment of OxPhos and
thus the decreased intracellular ATP is the primary cause of the PRX;TFAMf/f bone phenotype, we asked
whether correcting the ATP levels through forced upregulation of non-oxidative glycolysis would prevent the
low bone mass of PRX;TFAMf/f mice. For this purpose, we crossed PRX;TFAMf/f mutants with mice
overexpressing a constitutively stabilized HIF1 in the same cells (PRX;HIF1dPAf/f). HIF1 is known to promote
non-oxidative glycolysis and to impair OxPhos.. Preliminary analysis of PRX;TFAMf/f;HIF1dPAf/f double mutant
mice revealed that increased HIF1 activity corrected the bone phenotype of PRX;TFAMf/f mutants. Building on
these findings, we will now test the hypothesis that TFAM in cells of the osteoblast lineage is crucial for bone
mass accrual and maintenance by promoting OxPhos and thus ensuring the proper levels of intracellular ATP.
We will test our hypothesis in three Aims. Progressive impairment of mitochondrial activity has been
associated with numerous aging-related diseases, but it is uncertain whether this association is due, at least in
part, to a dysfunctional OxPhos. The successful accomplishment of the experiments we propose in this
application will expand and deepen our knowledge of the role of energy metabolism, particularly OxPhos, in
the regulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone mass accrual and maintenance.

Ganglioside GD2 is expressed on the cell surface of numerous pediatric cancers, including Ewing sarcoma,
osteosarcoma, and neuroblastoma. In 2015, FDA approval of the anti-GD2 immunotherapy dinutuximab
represented a paradigm shift in the treatment of neuroblastoma by significantly reducing the incidence of tumor
recurrence. Despite dinutuximab's success, dinutuximab fails ~30% of neuroblastoma patients. Reports
suggest that the degree of surface GD2 expression correlates with clinical response to dinutuximab. However,
the cellular mechanisms governing GD2 regulation in tumor cells remain unknown. Correlation of surface GD2
expression with RNA-sequencing in a large cohort of neuroblastoma cell lines revealed that GD2 expression is
associated with a mesenchymal epigenetic program. Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) has been
widely studied in epithelial solid tumors for its purported role in chemoresistance. However, there have been
no reports linking an adrenergic-to-mesenchymal transition (AMT) epigenetic program to regulation of surface
antigen GD2, making this relationship of intense interest to the neuroblastoma community. In this proposal,
AIM 1 will elucidate the relationship between AMT and GD2 expression by rigorously testing the sufficiency
and necessity of the neuroblastoma-specific AMT transcription factor PRRX1 to regulate GD2. Further, loss of
GD2 expression via AMT will be tested in vitro and in vivo for loss of response to dinutuximab. Aim 2 will
evaluate the pathways underlying loss of GD2 expression. Preliminary data suggest that mesenchymal cell
lines and tumors express markedly reduced GD3 synthase via epigenetic silencing at the gene promoter. We
will evaluate whether AMT directly regulates GD3 synthase, and whether restoration of its expression rescues
response to dinutuximab. These findings will directly link epigenetic state to the downregulation of tumor
antigen GD2 and response to dinutuximab. Further, these studies may help inform rational combinatorial
strategies to enhance anti-GD2 therapies in neuroblastoma, and could provide a framework for future studies
in other GD2-expressing pediatric cancers.","2500",

 Millions of bone grafting procedures are performed annually to repair bone defects in the oral cavity.
While autografts and allografts are used clinically for such purposes, their limitations have motivated much
research into synthetic graft materials. Although numerous biocompatible materials have been developed, lack
of bioactivity often times results in suboptimal results. The use of bioactive peptides on the surface of a
material can help create an interface between materials and living tissue. Using phage-display technology, our
laboratory has developed a dual-functional peptide DPI-VTK that contains both a mesenchymal stem cell
(MSC) binding domain and a hydroxyapatite binding domain. Such a peptide could not only enhance the
adhesion of MSCs to hydroxyapatite, but could also promote the specific migration of host MSCs, bypassing
the need for cell transplantation. Additionally, this peptide could be combined with BMP peptides in order to
create dual-functional osteoconductive and osteoinductive interfaces that encourage the homing of MSCs
along with their subsequent differentiation. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that enhancing the
osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity of materials with cell-specific peptides will result in increased
bone regeneration without reliance on exogenous cells.
 This project proposes the following aims: 1) Determine if DPI-VTK can enhance the regeneration of
bone defects in acellular scaffold models, 2) Determine if DPI-VTK can behave synergistically with BMP
derived peptides, and 3) Determine the MSC binding mechanism of DPI-VTK. The in-vivo studies will be
accomplished using a mouse calvarial defect model and the data analyzed using Micro-CT along with
histological staining. The peptide binding studies will be accomplished using ELISA based protein assays,
affinity pull-down assays, and mass spectrometry. The outcomes of these experiments will enhance our
understanding of cell-material interfaces in the context of tissue engineering as well as determine the potential
clinical utility of our laboratory's mineral binding peptides. Due to the widespread use of hydroxyapatite-based
biomaterials in craniofacial bone grafting, DPI-VTK could be very useful clinically for enhancing their integration
into native bone tissue. Developing dual-functional material that both recruit host cells and induce
differentiation could be a key strategy for regenerating large-volume defects without the need for exogenous
cells or autografts.","38918",

The periodontium is composed of cementum, alveolar bone and periodontal ligament (PDL) in between. Their
physiological turnover was known to be supported by stem cell populations1, 2. Based on mostly in vitro
approaches, the periodontal stem cells (PDLSC) were isolated from human molar PDL3. Despite of that, in vivo
location and identification of the periodontium stem cells remain largely unknown.
Periodontium regeneration during or after periodontitis is a most challenging issue despite of various treatment
strategies being designed. The regeneration capability difference strongly suggests that periodontium stem cells
behave differentially under physiological or pathological conditions. Activity of stem cells was known to be
regulated by the niche they are residing in. Various niche signals interplay which each other and keep stem cells
in a dynamic balance4, 5. Despite of tremendous progress of the niche studies for other stem cell populations,
the in vivo niche of periodontium stem cells has never been studied.
To address above challenges, it is therefore imperative to find out the in vivo identity of the periodontium
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and to learn their niche organization. Based on our preliminary experiments,
Gli1+ cells are identified as the MSCs for adult periodontium tissue. The Gli1+ cells are exclusively surrounding
the neurovascular bundle and are more enriched in the apical region of the PDL space. These Gli1+ cells are
negative for lineage differentiation or classical MSC markers. They give rise to the PDL, cementum, alveolar
bone and apical root pulp during physiological turnover. Blockage of canonical Wnt signaling leads to failure of
Gli1+ stem cells activation and severe periodontal tissue loss.
With these preliminary findings, comprehensive investigation is proposed for investigating the in vivo properties
and regulating niche of Gli1+ periodontium MSCs under physiological condition. The hypothesis is that Gli1+
MSCs are the dominant stem cell population within the periodontium and are regulated by a negative feedback
loop within the periodontium. Canonical Wnt signaling pathway activates and maintains periodontium MSCs.
Sclerostin ligand secreted from the cementum and alveolar bone negatively regulates the Gli1+ stem cell
activities. Interplays between the two opposing signals keep the periodontium MSCs in a dynamic balance.","317419",

 Proper nephron endowment and segmentation are essential for building healthy kidneys. Nephron number
is highly variable among humans. Low nephron number is associated with increased risk of hypertension and
end-stage renal disease. A better understanding of the mechanisms of nephrogenesis will help us devise a
way to increase nephron endowment. Along the proximal-distal axis, the renal corpuscle is connected to the
collecting duct via the proximal tubule, loop of Henle, and distal tubule. Each nephron segment carries out
distinct physiological functions. Understanding how multipotent nephron progenitors make their cell fate
decisions to develop into different nephron segments is essential not only for building a functional nephron in
vitro but also for promoting regeneration after kidney injury. In this proposed study, we will investigate how
retinoic acid signaling regulates nephron endowment and segmentation. We found that, in mice, inhibition of
retinoic acid signaling in mesenchymal nephron progenitor cells caused significantly lower nephron
endowment. We also found that inhibition of retinoic acid signaling in the newly formed developing nephron
interfered with the formation and maturation of proximal tubule cells. Our preliminary data suggest that retinoic
acid signaling plays important roles in early and later stages of nephrogenesis, contributing to proper nephron
endowment and segmentation. In Aim 1, by manipulating retinoic acid signaling genetically in vivo and
pharmacologically in vitro, we will test if retinoic acid signaling is required for mesenchymal-to-epithelial
transition of nephron progenitors by coordinating with Wnt/-catenin signaling. To understand how retinoic acid
signaling contributes to nephron endowment, we will determine the retinoic acid gene regulatory network in
nephron progenitors. In Aim 2, by performing genetic gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies of retinoic
acid signaling in the newly formed developing nephron, we will test if retinoic acid signaling is necessary or
sufficient for the formation and maturation of proximal tubules. We will also determine the retinoic acid gene
regulatory network in the developing nephrons to understand how retinoic acid signaling regulates nephron
segmentation. Our proposed studies will fill a longstanding gap of knowledge in the molecular mechanisms
underlying the determination of nephron endowment as well as the formation or maturation of proximal tubules
in mammals. Our long-term goals are to devise a way to increase nephron endowment during development
and to generate nephron tubule cells for potential cell replacement therapy.","363273",

an adult stem cell population that are associated with blood vessels throughout the body, and have been
shown to differentiate into all mesenchymal lineages, including collagen-producing fibroblasts. We propose to
establish that perivascular stem cells are indeed the cells responsible for extra-articular ligament repair by
performing lineage tracing of PSCs in a model of MCL injury, and examining healing MCL with partial PSC
ablation. Additionally, we plan to characterize the effects of PSCs on MCL healing and a scaffold-based model
of ACL reconstruction. Collectively, these studies would establish the foundation for new PSC-based clinical

ligamentous injury is high in the Veteran population. These injuries have significant impact on Veterans’ quality
of life and ability to meet their occupational, recreational, and health goals. There is a need for better treatment
options to augment surgical repair or reconstruction for some of these ligament and tendon injuries. In
particular, 73% of massive rotator cuff tears fail to heal following surgical repair, and there are limited graft
options for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. In order to address these shortcomings in current
surgical options, a biomimetic stem cell-based solution would be ideal.
Our approach to this problem is inspired by the body’s own ability to heal after injury. While poorly-vascularized
intra-articular ligament injuries such as ACL tears do not heal, well-vascularized extra-articular ligaments such
as the medial collateral ligament (MCL) can heal without operative intervention. The exact mechanisms behind
this observation are not well-understood. We hypothesize that a major difference between ligament healing
and non-healing is access to vascular supply, specifically, vascular-associated mesenchymal stem cells.
Pericytes are perivascular stem cell (PSC) population that is associated with blood vessels throughout the
body. Studies on tendon remodeling have postulated that pericytes from the tendon sheath are responsible for
neo-tendon formation in the event of tendon injury. However, these reports do not provide any empiric
evidence to support this hypothesis. It is our goal to provide definitive evidence of this hypothesis by using a
lineage tracing mouse model and a model of pericyte ablation to systematically establish the role that pericytes
play during ligament healing. We further propose to evaluate the efficacy of using human pericytes to treat
injuries to fibrous tissues such as the MCL and for a tissue-engineered ACL graft. Regardless of whether
pericytes directly contribute to ligament healing, they remain an attractive clinical option due to ease of
isolation and likely trophic effects. Our over-arching goal is to establish a basic science mechanism and proof
of concept for PSC-based therapies for ligament and tendon injuries. The overall hypothesis of this highly
clinically relevant proposal is that pericytes contribute to extra-articular ligament healing; and that exogenous
PSC-based therapies can enhance healing in both intra-articular and extra-articular ligament injuries.
If successful, these studies would collectively establish the foundation for new pericyte-based therapies to treat
ligament injuries that are unfortunately very common in Veterans. Specifically, these would include both
injections to promote the non-operative healing of extra-articular ligament injuries such as MCL sprains,
adjunct therapy for surgical treatment of tendon and ligament tears such as rotator cuff injuries, and cell-
seeded constructs for the surgical reconstruction of intra-articular ligament injuries such as ACL rupture."," ",

Brain tumors remain among the most malignant and deadly cancers, with adult glioblastoma (GBM) having a
median survival of 15 months and five-year survival of less than 10 percent (Stupp et al., 2009), despite surgery,
chemotherapy (temozolomide), and radiation. While each of these approaches provides an overall survival
benefit of a few months, they do not offer a longer-term survival benefit or cure, even in combination. Thus, new
therapy approaches are sorely needed. To rationally develop therapies, it is critical that we have better
experimental systems for both fundamental and preclinical investigations that faithfully recapitulate key features
of the human disease while bringing the full power of state-of-the-art engineering approaches to bear including
modeling and simulation. In unpublished work, we have found that the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposase system
we developed can be used to produce two major GBM, proneural (PN) and mesenchymal (MES), in immune-
competent wild-type mice using known human oncogenic drivers of glioblastoma, and that individual cancer cells
can be tracked in live tumors via multichannel fluorescence imaging. We hypothesize that mechanical forces
mediate a key targetable difference between PN and MES subtypes, and that the immune cold/hot signatures of
PN and MES subtypes represents a second key targetable difference between subtypes. To test these
hypotheses, we will measure cellular force and signaling dynamics of cancer cells and T cells in live GBM tumors
(Aim 1) and Measure immune cell dynamics in live GBM tumors (Aim 2). In particular we will measure cell traction
forces, kinase and GEF signaling, and extracellular matrix architecture in live tumors and brain tissue. In addition,
we will track antitumoral T cells, and protumoral microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages, and their
correlations with each other and GBM cells, in the SB mouse models of PN and MES. These experiments will
be used to parameterize the Cell Migration Simulator (CMS) and Brownian Dynamics Tumor Simulator (BDTS)
to create predictive models that are GBM subtype-specific. In most cases, these measurements will be the first
of their kind in live GBM tumors, and will inform cell and tumor scale biophysical models. In so doing, RTB2 will
be providing a state-of-the-art integrated experimental-computational testbed for development of imaging
modalities in the TECH unit."," ",

The tooth root is a critical component of the tooth, anchored to surrounding alveolar bones through the
periodontal ligament (PDL). Appropriate formation of the root and its surrounding structure is essential not only
for fundamental functions of the tooth in mastication for nutrition intake, but also for growth and development of
the lower face. Prevalent dental diseases such as caries and periodontal diseases are the etiology for tooth
loss, which can be treated only by prostheses lacking functional structures, leading to compromised long-term
prognosis. An effective approach to regenerate a functional periodontal attachment apparatus is needed to
achieve a breakthrough in dental regenerative therapies. During tooth root formation, the dental follicle (DF)
provides precursor cells for cementoblasts, periodontal ligament (PDL) cells and alveolar cryptal bone
osteoblasts to establish the functional periodontal attachment apparatus, the periodontium. Currently, how
diverse populations of dental root mesenchymal progenitor cells work together and generate highly functional
tooth roots remains unknown. In this proposal, we will define how concerted actions of distinct classes of
dental root mesenchymal progenitor cells are essential for proper formation and regeneration of the tooth root
accompanied by a functional periodontal attachment apparatus. In Aim 1, we will define how Hedgehog-Fox
pathway regulates DF mesenchymal progenitor cells. We hypothesize that the Forkhead (Fox) transcription
factors play a key role in regulating physiological functions of Hedgehog-responsive DF mesenchymal
progenitor cells. We will first reveal the diversity of Hedgehog-responsive Gli1+ DF cells using single cell RNA-
seq analyses, and determine their relationships with PTHrP+ DF cells and other precursor cell populations.
Second, we will determine the function of Gli1+, PTHrP+ and Runx2+ cells in periodontium formation using
inducible cell ablation experiments, and further test the function of Foxf1 and Foxf2 in periodontium formation
using their floxed alleles. In Aim 2, we will identify Wnt-mediated roles of apical root mesenchymal progenitor
cells in tooth root formation. We hypothesize that chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12)+ mesenchymal
progenitor cells in the apical root area orchestrate formation of the tooth root and the apical periodontium in a
canonical Wnt signaling-mediated manner. We will determine the relationship between CXCL12+ cells and
stem cells for apical papilla (SCAP) using ex vivo culture system, and define molecular mechanisms underlying
a Wnt-mediated cell fate choice of mesenchymal progenitor cells by a comparative RNA-seq analysis followed
by in situ validation. In Aim 3, we will determine actions of dental root mesenchymal progenitor cells in
periodontal regeneration. We hypothesize that distinct classes of dental root mesenchymal progenitor cells
contribute to regeneration in a concerted manner. We will define how descendants of Gli1+, PTHrP+, Runx2+
and CXCL12+ progenitor cells contribute to periodontal regeneration after bone destruction, by utilizing a
ligature-induced periodontitis model mimicking periodontal diseases, and a surgical periodontal defect model.","340801",

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is both the third most common and deadliest cancer in the United States. Despite recent
advances in treatment, the 5-year survival rate remains poor due to multiple factors including delayed diagnosis,
chemoresistance, and disease heterogeneity. Altered expression of enteroendocrine protein signaling
components consisting of Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 (FGFR4), its ligand Fibroblast Growth Factor 19
(FGF19), and co-receptor Klotho Beta (KLB) recently have been implicated in various cancers. Specific to CRC,
the role of KLB remains elusive, although FGF19 and FGFR4 have more established oncogenic functions. An
objective of this proposed research is to delineate KLB’s function in CRC. The work is predicated on the analysis
of CRC RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database consistently showing significant
repression in CRC generally and across all subtypes. Collectively, it is necessary to further investigate and
validate KLB’s role in CRC, focusing on how KLB modulates oncogenic FGFR4-FGF19 signaling in the larger
context of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumorigenesis. Thus, our overall hypothesis is that KLB
demonstrates tumor suppressor properties in CRC by negatively regulating oncogenic, EMT-promoting
FGFR4-FGF19 signaling. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis by analyzing detailed clinical parameters via
informatics to assess the prognostic value of KLB deficiency in CRC and reveal its impact on tumor dynamics in
vitro and in vivo. Our preliminary data reveals tumor-suppressor-like properties of KLB as its expression is directly
associated with treatment success, microsatellite stability, survivability and inversely with pathologic stage.
Additionally, KLB downregulation occurs as early as the adenoma stage further supported by a CRC cell line
panel showing global KLB repression which directly correlated with differentiation status. Finally, KLB expression
was enhanced in two separate in vitro CRC models of differentiation and its transgenic overexpression was
associated with increased cellular organization and polarization of HT29 cells compared to CrisprCas9-induced
knock down. Specific Aim 2 will investigate KLB’s mechanism of action by testing FGFR4-FGF19 signaling as
the major effector pathway through which KLB affects CRC. In support of this Aim, we present compelling new
preliminary evidence showing that KLB expression positively correlates with Farnesoid-X-Receptor (FXR), a
known tumor suppressor and target of FGFR4 signaling, within the clinical data thereby indicating possible
crosstalk. Additionally, chemical agonism of FXR induces KLB expression in Caco2 cells in vitro. By performing
these studies, we expect to (i) Establish KLB’s clinical implications in CRC, and (ii) Demonstrate that KLB affects
CRC mechanistically through regulation of FGFR4-FGF19 signaling. Overall, this study will establish a tentative
role for KLB in CRC and how its presence impacts oncogenic FGFR4-FGF19 signaling. The ultimate goal of this
proposal is to utilize KLB expression to predict prognosis, treatment response and serve as a potential
therapeutic target for improving CRC patient outcomes.","31592",

cartilage prior to forming bone. Perturbations in their capacity to differentiate leads to skeletal anomalies.
Therefore, deciphering the molecular mechanisms controlling these cells is crucial for both understanding the
causes of skeletal diseases as well as developing new therapeutic approaches to restore the skeleton. While
transcription factors and signaling molecules have been linked to cartilage development, less is known about
the upstream mechanisms that initiate the process. Recent data from mice and humans implicate epigenetic
regulatory factors as critical modulators of MPC function. CXXC finger protein 1 (Cfp1) is an epigenetic
regulatory factor implicated in progenitor cell function, though the mechanism(s) of its action have not been
well defined. To address this, we deleted Cfp1 specifically from limb bud mesenchyme. Preliminary data show
that loss of Cfp1 results in the complete absence of forelimbs at birth. Subsequent analysis of embryonic
forelimbs revealed that, in the absence of Cfp1, MPCs failed to undergo condensation, the initial step in
chondrogenesis. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed a dramatic reduction in chondrogenic gene markers,
including the master transcriptional regulator, Sox9, which is required for condensation, further implicating Cfp1
as a crucial factor in the early stages of cartilage formation. Preliminary data indicate that Cfp1 may regulate
this key developmental step through activation of BMP signaling. Further, while mutant hindlimbs form they are
severely stunted, consistent with our observation that deletion of Cfp1 in chondrocytes results in shorter bones.
Together, these data suggest that Cfp1 also regulates chondrocyte differentiation and maturation during
growth plate development. We hypothesize that Cfp1 regulates multiple stages of cartilage development
through modulation of essential transcriptional regulators and key signaling pathways. Further study of Cfp1
will provide fundamental insight into how epigenetic regulation of cellular and molecular mechanisms impacts
chondrogenesis and growth plate development. We propose: 1) to identify Cfp1's actions during chondrocyte
differentiation in the developing long bone, 2) to determine the effect of Cfp1 loss on growth plate development
and 3) to identify the Cfp1 regulatory network during cartilage development.","394595",

Fracture healing is a complex bone healing process regulated by various classes of cells and signaling
mechanisms. Of these, Wnt signaling has long been known to be critically important in directing the differentiation
of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into osteoblasts during bone healing. However, the source of these Wnt
ligands is not known. Recently, a body of literature has arisen finding both beneficial and detrimental effects of
macrophage-derived Wnt ligands on the regeneration of other tissues (liver, kidney, heart, and intestine), often
by their modulation of progenitor cell behavior. As macrophages have been well-characterized as orchestrators
of healing, their use of Wnt signaling to regulate tissue regeneration is unsurprising. However, no studies have
yet identified the contribution of macrophages to Wnt signaling during fracture healing. Interestingly, recent
unpublished data suggests that macrophages represent a major source of Wnt ligands during bone healing and
underscore the importance of macrophages in driving this process. In the work proposed here, the expression
of Wnt ligands by macrophages will first be measured, as well as the cells targeted by Wnt ligands, during fracture
healing. Then, Wls, the gene encoding a necessary Wnt ligand trafficking protein, will be deleted in Csf1r-
expressing cells (monocytes and macrophages), inhibiting the secretion of all Wnt ligands by these cells after
induction of Cre recombinase with tamoxifen. Following deletion of macrophage Wls, the consequences of loss
of macrophage-derived Wnt ligands will be characterized during the inflammatory, soft callus, and hard callus
phases of healing. Appropriate transition through these phases, and ultimately successful healing, will be
evaluated using qPCR, flow cytometry, micro-computed tomography, and histology. Finally, the mechanism of
Wnt trafficking to MSCs, and the consequences of their effects on MSC behavior, will be evaluated through in
vitro co-culture experiments. The studies defined in this proposal will elucidate the importance of macrophage
Wnt ligands on bone healing and potentially identify Wnt signaling as a targetable pathway to enhance successful
osseous healing.","47003",

not only because of its unique biology, including Glioma Stem-like Cells (GSCs), but also because of the delivery
challenges imposed by the blood-brain and blood-tumor barriers. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify
effective GBM-specific therapeutics and to elucidate strategies for delivering these new agents. A promising new
approach is treatment with microRNAs (miRs), which are small, noncoding RNAs that are powerful regulators of
gene expression. We have shown that restoration of tumor suppressor miRs is capable of killing GSCs and,
therefore, treatment with miRs is potentially a new paradigm in GBM therapy. However, it is currently unknown
which miRs will be most effective against GBMs and how these miRs should be delivered. This grant is significant
because it directly addresses both of these problems by identifying the most effect anti-GBM miRs and by
developing exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a new delivery strategy
for these miRs. Exosomes are naturally occurring nanovesicles that function as intercellular transport vehicles.
We hypothesize that miRs can be used as effective therapeutics against GBMs, and that exosomes derived from
cultured MSCs can be used to systemically deliver these antiglioma miRs. Aim 1 will identify miRs that are most
effective against GSCs. In an in vitro high-throughput screen (HTS) of 578 miRs against a panel of GSCs, we
have already identified 50 antiglioma miRs that effectively kill GSCs in vitro. This aim will use an in vivo HTS to
determine which of the 50 top candidates is most effective against orthotopic GSCs in mice, and it will define the
most effective miR combinations. Mechanistic studies will identify the target(s) responsible for the anti-GBM
effects. Aim 2 will develop MSC-derived exosomes as novel delivery vehicles of antiglioma miRs. We have
shown that after transduction with lentiviruses containing antiglioma miRs, MSCs package the miRs into
exosomes (called Exos-miRs) and secrete the Exo-miRs into the culture medium. These Exo-miRs can be
isolated and delivered systemically, after which they home to GSCs and inhibit target genes. This aim will define
the optimal dose/schedule of Exos-miRs using bioluminescence imaging and a novel TET-reporter system. This
dose/schedule will be used to test the efficacy and safety of the best antiglioma miRs or miR combinations
identified in Aim 1. Aim 3 will elucidate the mechanisms underlying the ability of Exos-miRs to home to GBMs.
By using proteomic analyses to compare strongly homing exosomes (MSC-Exos) with poorly homing ones
(fibroblast-Exos), we have identified candidate homing proteins. In this aim, we will perform functional analyses
to determine the extent to which the identified proteins mediate the homing of Exo-miRs to GBMs. Successful
completion of this grant will result in a new and integrated agent/delivery paradigm that uses miRs to treat GBMs
and MSC-derived exosomes to deliver these miRs, and that has the potential to improve the survival of the
estimated 15,000 people who die of GBM each year due to the current lack of effective therapy for this disease.","329400",

 Vascular cell heterogeneity is a fascinating but poorly understood phenomenon. Numerous vascular cell
types undergo fate transitions under pathological conditions. This includes endothelial cells (ECs) undergoing
endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and acquiring certain characteristics typical of macrophages
and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). SMCs, in turn, can also acquire macrophage-like features while bone
marrow-derived mononuclear cells can express certain EC and SMC markers when present at sites of chronic
inflammation. These cells fate transitions have been linked to various pathologies including atherosclerosis,
aneurysms, pulmonary hypertension and cavernous cerebral malformations. While the existence of these cell
fate transitions is now well accepted, little is known about the origin and characteristics of SMCs undergoing
these fate changes. Our preliminary data suggest that certain subpopulations of normal SMCs are particularly
prone to phenotypic modulation and are predominately pathogenic. We hypothesize that a small subpopulation
of normal SMCs is responsible for pathogenesis of CV diseases associated with expansion of the SMC pool
and that targeting these cells might prove to be a better and more specific therapeutic approach. It is our goal
in this application to define these cell populations, determine what drives their pathogenic responses and begin
identifying therapeutic approaches to controlling CV illnesses driven by specifically targeting these SMC
subsets.","747572",

VA disability. There is a significant interaction between chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
and persistent post-concussive syndromes common to the veteran population. Therefore, the VA healthcare
mission to explore novel strategies to reduce chronic pain is vital. Chronic pain falls into two most common
classifications including nociceptive and neuropathic pains. The majority of chronic pain disorders start off with
a nociceptive source, although it is not uncommon for someone to have multiple pain conditions . Chronic
pancreatitis (CP) is an inflammatory disease of
the pancreas characterized by irreversible fibrosis, pancreas
atrophy, and exocrine dysfunction. Pain suffered by CP patients is among the worst encountered in medicine.
Chronic pain in the VA population and patients with CP share common underlying mechanisms, which are
inflammation and altered nociceptor transmission in peripheral neurons. CP pain therefore provides a useful
model for the understanding and treatment of pain syndromes with an identifiable nociceptive source in
general. Although current therapy provides relief to acute pain, drugs used for treatment of chronic pain are
typically less efficacious and limited by many side effects. The use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and
other anti-inflammatory agent such as human alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), as therapeutic tools are novel
therapies to treat chronic pain. In our previous studies we found that MSC infusion or treatment with hAAT
reduced pain and mitigated pancreas inflammation and disease progression in mouse models of CP. To
enhance the functionality of MSCs and to effectively deliver AAT locally into the pancreas in a sustainable
fashion, we engineered human AAT (hAAT) overexpressing MSCs by transfecting MSCs with a lentivirus
encoding the hAAT gene. hAAT-MSCs showed better migration ability, increased stemness and secretion of
AAT and other factors critical for MSC function compared to vector-treated control MSCs. Based on these
data, we hypothesize that hAAT-MSC infusion is an effective therapy for the treatment of CP and its associated
pain by inhibition of immune cell activation and suppression of nociceptor activation. The overall objective of
this study is to determine, in a pre-clinical rodent model of painful CP, the therapeutic and mechanistic impact
of hAAT-MSCs in inflammation reduction and pain relief and explore their potential translation to human
therapy using samples collected from patients with painful CP."," ",

This
fibrofatty degeneration (“FFD”) results not only in functional decline of skeletal muscle but also to the increased
prevalence of metabolic disorders. The origins of the major cellular contributors (fibrogenic and adipogenic
progenitors) of this FFD remain to be definitively identified, but recent evidence (including Preliminary Studies
included herein) suggest a population of mesenchymal progenitors termed “fibroadipogenic progenitors”
(FAPs) are major sources. FAPs reside in the muscle interstitium and display robust fibrogenic and adipogenic
potential in vitro and in vivo following transplantation. Studies in vivo to directly test whether endogenous FAPs
are responsible for fibrosis and adiposity in the setting of injury and disease have been limited by the lack of
specific tools to genetically label and target FAPs. We have recently developed such tools by taking advantage
of the highly specific expression of PDGFRα in FAPs among the mononucleated cells of muscle. Our
Preliminary Studies using a PDGFRαCreER strain that we developed to either genetically label or specifically
deplete FAPs support the hypothesis that FAPs are sources of both fibrogenic and adipogenic cells in the
setting of aberrant muscle regeneration associated with FFD. In Preliminary Studies, we also identified a
microRNA, miR-206, as a candidate regulator of FAP adipogenic differentiation, and a transcription factor,
Runx1, as a likely target of mIR-206 in this process. We have, in addition, identified candidate microRNAs
involved in the regulation of FAP fibrogenic differentiation.
 In the studies of this proposal, we will explore the regulation of FAP adipogenic and fibrogenic
differentiation, and the essential role of FAPs in FFD in two clinically relevant models. In the studies of Aim 1,
we will examine the role of the miR-206/Runx1 axis in FAP adipogenic differentiation in vitro and in fatty
infiltration in glycerol-induced muscle injury in vivo. In the studies of Aim 2, we will work collaboratively with our
colleague, Dr. Brian Feeley, at UCSF to explore the role of FAPs in general, and of the miR-206/Runx1 axis in
particular, in the fatty infiltration that occurs in the setting of rotator cuff injury (RCI). Dr. Feeley has developed
a robust murine model of RCI that exhibits the kind of fatty infiltration and muscle atrophy seen in humans. We
will use a novel tamoxifen analog delivery method we have developed to allow for the depletion of FAPs only in
the region of the RCI. In the studies of Aim 3, we will examine the regulation of FAP fibrogenic differentiation,
again focusing on the key role of miRNAs in such cell fate decisions. We will identify functional targets of
candidate miRNAs using a recently developed pull-down technology combine with RNA sequencing (LAMP-
seq). Furthermore, we will address the role of FAPs in the extensive fibrosis seen in the common extremity

extensive experience with a murine model of VML, and we will examine both the development of fibrosis and
interventions to prevent fibrosis based on our understanding of FAP differentiation.
 Through our studies of FAPs and the regulatory processes that control their differentiation to adipogenic
and fibrogenic cells, we aim to understand the mechanisms that give rise to FFD and the subsequent muscle
dysfunction. Our investigation will both capitalize on new experimental tools to study this population and lend
insight into therapeutic strategies to prevent FFD. This will have direct relevance to Veterans who have
experienced skeletal muscle injuries, injuries that have limited their functional capacity and that, to date, have
little hope of functional recovery. Our goal is to develop therapeutic approaches to enhance muscle repair and
prevent muscle degeneration based upon a thorough understanding of the basic stem cell biology. These
goals are based upon a firm commitment to a mission to improve the health and quality of life of Veterans
whose function is limited by the lack of effective therapeutic options."," ",

Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a major limiting complication of allogeneic stem cell
transplantation for the treatment of leukemia/lymphoma and certain solid tumors. aGVHD occurs when T
lymphocytes from donor bone marrow attack cells within the recipient that are critical to the function vital
organs, namely skin, liver and gut. During the past three decades of research, Dr. Murphy’s laboratory has
found that in skin and squamous mucosae, the first sites of effector-target cell interaction provoked by
differences in minor histocompatibility antigens, involve T cells bearing Vb-specific markers that home
selectively to epithelial rete ridges as well as the epithelial stem cell-rich bulge regions of murine hair follicles.
This association results in death by apoptosis of adjacent epithelial cells that express the stem cell marker,
cytokeratin 15. Systemic therapeutic inhibition of these effector limbs is riddled with problems that include
collateral impact on immune reconstitution and blunting of graft-versus-tumor effects. However, we now know
through discoveries made in collaboration with co-PIs of this proposal, Drs. Markus and Natasha Frank, that
the skin and squamous mucosae harbor intrinsic cellular pathways capable of potent immunosuppression.
Specifically, we have discovered a dermal dendritic cell that has stem cell characteristics, expresses the
multidrug resistance transporter ABCB5, and also expresses PD-1. This cell has the ability to thwart T cell
responses, including alloreactivity, and therefore holds significant but as yet unexplored promise as a skin-
intrinsic pathway that may be leveraged to inhibit the tissue injury in aGVHD. In this proposal, Dr. Murphy and
the Drs. Frank have combined forces to address the long-term objective of harnessing the skin’s intrinsic
immunosuppressive capabilities to thwart aGVHD. The proposal’s specific objective is to determine the impact
of PD-1-expressing immunosuppressive dermal mesenchymal stem cells on the earliest and most specific
effector-target cell interactions responsible for aGVHD. To this end, we have proposed three specific aims:
1) to correlate spatiotemporal multiplex immune profiling with all aspects of disease morbidity and recovery
in aGVHD; 2) to dissect ABCB5 dermal stem cell function in aGVHD and define PD-1/PD-L1-centered
strategies for skin-intrinsic immunosuppression; and 3) to apply ABCB5+ dermal stem cell transplant
strategies to influence aGVHD severity using spatiotemporal multiplex immune profiling as effector-target
bioassay. The approaches involve state-of-the-art multiplex immunophenotyping of effector-target cell
interactions that sensitively and specifically typify tissue injury in aGVHD, and leverage ABCB5 gene knockout
and lineage tracing models in context of PD-L1 Ig administration and ABCB5+ stem cell engraftment. The
rationale is that upon successful completion of this work, we will identify novel therapeutic approaches to the
treatment and prevention of aGVHD skin and squamous mucosal pathology through manipulation of skin-
intrinsic immunosuppressive pathways.","433517",

 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in bone marrow provide regenerative capacity for bone, replacing and
reinforcing the skeleton at load bearing sites. When we age or in prolonged bedrest, MSCs lose their
regenerative potential, often measured by their proliferative and differentiation capacity. This loss of MSC
health causes osteoporosis and delayed healing, ultimately resulting in decreased quality of life and
increased medical costs. A fundamental knowledge gap preventing effective therapies in aging and MSC
related regenerative medicine is how aging and bedrest impedes MSC health.
 The nucleus, central to all cellular activity, relies on both mechanical input as well as its molecular
transducers to regulate intra-nuclear chromatin organization that ultimately determine cell function and
fate. Thus, failure to transmit this information to the nucleus would lead to the breakdown of these
processes. Here, we ask if aging is a process that limits information flow into the nucleus, ultimately
diminishing its organizational capacity and responsiveness to outside stimuli. As we will show, disabling
the mechanical connection between cytoskeleton and nucleus facilitated by Linker of Nucleoskeleton and
Nucleoskeleton (LINC) complexes, impairs mechanosensitivity by affecting βcatenin and YAP/TAZ
signaling. This leads to decreased proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.
Our principal hypothesis is that loss of LINC-connectivity significantly contributes to MSC aging by
 disrupting nuclear mechanotransduction.
 Through this revision submitted in response to [PA16-442] - Changes in Cellular Architecture
During Aging (R01), we will address our principal hypothesis through two specific aims, each using a
distinct hypotheses to examine how inhibiting LINC complex function as well as how aging related loss
of LINC complex limits MSC mechanosignaling of known mechanotransducers βcatenin and YAP/TAZ.
We will further determine the force-induced mechanisms of how sustained physical activity protects LINC
complex expression to augment MSC and bone mechanosignaling within the context of aging.
If successful, we will establish, for the first time, a mechanistic understanding of how loss of LINC complex
drives decreased mechanosensory capability in aging. Completion of these aims will provide research
communities with (1) efficacy of LIV based regenerative modalities that improve LINC-mediated
mechanosignaling and (2) foundational structure-function relationship data in healthy and aged stem
cells.","72716",

One major group of environmental toxicant that affect humans negatively are endocrine disrupting
chemicals (EDCs). These chemicals interfere with the body’s natural hormone regulation leading
to a range of human diseases. Our research focuses on the EDC tributyltin (TBT), a chemical
frequently used as a pesticide and plastic stabilizer. TBT has major adipogenic effects when
exposed in utero or in adult multipotent stem cells. Previously published data have demonstrated
that TBT exposure promotes differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into adipogenesis,
and also increases their lipid content, representing both numerical and qualitative effects on
adipocytes. Mechanistically, TBT has been found to bind to the ligand-binding domain of the
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) transcription factor (TF), which is
known to form a heterodimer with the RXR TF when activated, promoting a transcriptional
reprogramming of MSCs to commit them to adipogenesis. MSCs can differentiate into a number
of lineages, including muscle, bone, cartilage and fibrocystic cells. When a cell undergoes
transcriptional reprogramming, the sites at which the TFs bind change, reflected by alterations of
the distributions of loci of open chromatin. In this project, we propose to differentiate MSCs to
both adipocytes and myocytes, initially using the cell culture conditions known to promote specific
differentiation of MSCs. We will map the loci of open chromatin and test gene expression in these
samples, allowing us to identify TFs mediating these differentiation pathways by searching for
motif enrichment corresponding to known TF binding sites. With this information available, we
can then use the same approaches to test how TBT causes transcriptional reprogramming, which
should reveal whether the process is identical or involves a different set of TFs. Finally, we will
apply the new CellTagging approach to test cells at multiple stages of differentiation to myocytes
to test whether TBT exposure affects only undifferentiated MSCs, or can also cause
transdifferentiation of cells already developing in the myogenic lineage. These new insights into
the mechanism of action of TBT will be valuable in understanding how EDCs have their disease-
causing effects. We will also get insights from TBT into how we a small molecule can mediate
‘epigenetic therapy’, influencing transcriptional reprogramming but in a way that is targeted to
specific genomic locations. Under the mentorship of Drs. John Greally and Paul Frenette, I will
accomplish these goals while developing new skills in developmental biology and genetics.

remains a major clinical issue worldwide. Current knowledge about treatment failure is mostly derived from
research on intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance in epithelial tumor cells. However, recent studies have
implicated a critical role for host cells (i.e., the tissue microenvironment) in building a protective “niche” for
tumor cells enabling their escape from chemotherapeutic treatments. Notably, the host regenerative response
upon chemotherapy “injury”, which is regarded as a host intrinsic mechanism to repair damaged tissues, may
be exploited by tumor cells for their local recurrence or distant metastases. The proposed study will build on
our extensive experience in the study of tumor-stroma interactions in breast cancer metastasis, and will
investigate the poorly explored question of how chemotherapy-induced changes in the lung stroma foster the
early relapse of tumor cells in the lung. Based on our previous findings that tissue resident mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) acquire a significantly higher potential to promote local tumor growth upon cancer therapies, we
hypothesize that systemic chemotherapy treatment stimulates regenerative responses in lung resident MSCs,
which are, in turn, utilized by drug-resistant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) for their metastatic relapse in the
lung. By designing different chemotherapy treatment scenarios in animal models mimicking clinical situations
in human breast cancer patients, we will in Aim 1 determine how chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and
doxorubicin modulate the lung resident MSCs using our newly established endogenous MSC modeling
platform in mice. Subsequently, we will in Aim 2 delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying drug-activated
lung resident MSCs to support metastatic tumor growth in the lung, with a focus on the TLR4 signaling
pathway and the key wound healing cytokine osteopontin (OPN). Finally, we will in Aim 3 define the
translational potential of stroma targeting approaches using both patient-derived xenograft models and breast
cancer patient specimen analyses. We will specifically focus on the therapeutic efficacy of combining
chemotherapy with TLR4 or OPN blockage in treatment of patient-derived human basal-like xenograft breast
tumors. Further, by analyzing clinical plasma samples from human breast cancer patients, we expect to
develop plasma OPN as a biomarker to predict early metastatic relapse of breast cancer patients after
chemotherapy. Overall, our proposed study will energize an underdeveloped field of research that investigates
the impact of cancer therapeutics on the pre-metastatic microenvironment. Findings from the proposed study

The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will provide the candidate, Dr. Alix
Berglund, DVM, PhD, with the necessary knowledge, training, and experience to become an independent
translational biomedical researcher in the fields of immunology and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) biology.
MSCs are a promising cell source for treating inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. Allogeneic therapy
would provide cost-effective and efficient treatment, but is currently hindered by recipient immune rejection of
donor MSCs expressing mismatched-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. MSCs are strongly
immunomodulatory, however, and manipulation of MHC expression may be sufficient to allow donor MSCs to
evade recipient immune responses. The central hypothesis of this proposal, which is supported by strong
preliminary research, is that treating MSCs with transforming growth factor-β2 (TGF-β2) downregulates MHC I
and MHC II gene transcription thereby reducing the in vivo immunogenicity of MHC-mismatched MSCs. The
aims of this project are to 1) Identify how TGF-β2 downregulates MHC expression in MSCs and 2) Determine
how TGF-β2 treatment affects MSC immunogenicity in vivo. Both murine and equine MSCs will be utilized to
elucidate TGF-β2 signaling pathways to increase translational potential to humans (Aim 1) and non-inflammatory
and inflammatory murine models will be used to analyze how the immune system responds to TGF-β2-treated
MSCs in vivo (Aim 2). Completion of the proposed research is a first step towards improving the efficacy and
safety of allogeneic MSCs for clinical use. To accomplish these aims, Dr. Berglund will build on her background
in mesenchymal stem cell biology, immunology, and large animal models by developing expertise in molecular
immunology techniques, in vivo alloimmune response analysis, and the utilization of murine models. Dr.
Berglund's mentoring team has combined expertise in immunology, mesenchymal stem cells, and genetics to
facilitate her transition to an independent translational biomedical researcher. This work will be completed
primarily at the North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine, which is eminently qualified to
train translational clinician scientists, with additional work at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill.","117890",

Cataract remains the leading cause of blindness worldwide with over 3 million extractions performed each year
in the United States alone. During cataract surgery, the contents inside the lens capsule are removed through a
hole in the anterior lens capsule and a polymeric intraocular lens (IOL) is placed in the capsule. The leading
vision-threatening complication, posterior capsule opacification (PCO), occurs when residual lens epithelial cells
(LEC) migrate from the anterior to the posterior lens capsule or onto the IOL and undergo epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT). While several factors impacting mechanobiology and epithelial cell response
have been previously investigated, there is not a clear understanding of the impact of viscoelasticity and
curvature on LEC behavior. The overall objective of this project is to use polymer and hydrogel substrates that
mimic the implants and lens microenvironment, respectively, to better analyze the influence mechanical
properties have on LEC response and EMT. It is hypothesized that the physical and mechanical properties of
the microenvironment are altered after the removal of the lens tissue and IOL placement, facilitating EMT in LEC.
In Aim 1, tunable polymer substrates and hydrogels will be used to investigate the impact of stiffness and
viscoelasticity on LEC response and EMT. It is hypothesized that substrates stiffer than the lens capsule, and
substrates with lower loss tangent will drive EMT in LEC. In Aim 2, the effect of substrate curvature will be
investigated using the same polymer and hydrogel substrates. The governing hypothesis is that LEC migration
and EMT are driven by larger radius of curvature caused by flattening of the lens capsule after IOL implantation.
Curvature effects will be evaluated using polymers micropatterned with different radii of curvature. Glass
microbeads of various sizes will be embedded in hydrogel formulations, mimicking the changes in the lens
capsule shape following surgery. In both aims, relevant in vitro and ex vivo models will be used. LEC proliferation,
migration, and markers for EMT will be assessed. TGF-β and rapamycin will be used as positive and negative
inducers of EMT, respectively. RT-PCR will quantify gene expression, and changes in protein expression will be
evaluated using Western blot and immunofluorescence. Specific genes and proteins that will be evaluated
include SMAD signaling proteins, α-SMA, Slug, Snail, fibronectin, E-cadherin, and YAP. The goal of this project
is to determine how substrate mechanical properties, namely viscoelasticity and curvature, contribute to LEC
behavior and induction of EMT. This will significantly enhance our knowledge of LEC mechanobiology and the
role of these factors in EMT, suggesting strategies to prevent pathological EMT. The results will lead to future
research on design of materials to prevent EMT and fibrosis after implantation, particularly for preventing PCO.","182622",

Voice impairment is the most common communication disorder with nearly 20 million people in the US reporting
symptoms of dysphonia annually. The cost of treatment and lost wages for this disorder is approaching $13
billion. The etiology of these disorders is diverse, but given their anatomic location, the vocal folds (VFs) are
susceptible to a multitude of injurious stimuli, including reflux of gastric contents, iatrogenic injury, and the
inherent trauma associated with voice production. Injury can result in altered lamina propria (LP) architecture
resulting in aberrant phonatory physiology. To date, no treatment restores the native VF extracellular matrix
(ECM) composition, structure, and function following VF injury which likely underlies suboptimal outcomes for
patients with VF scar.
ECMs, if appropriately processed, can be used as resorbable, clinically safe, and naturally derived biomaterials
that promote tissue remodeling while reducing fibrosis. Injectable ECM hydrogels are ideal for clinical application
and cell delivery, particularly given the emerging practice and distinct advantages of in-office procedures using
minimally invasive approaches. Work from our group and others provide promising data regarding the role of
decellularized vocal fold lamina propria (VFLP-ECM) as an injectable agent or as a delivery vehicle for
therapeutic cells such as mesenchymal stem cells. We broadly hypothesize that VFLP-ECM hydrogels (with or
without stem cells) will promote functional repair of the VFs.","513277",

Increasing the dose of conventional total
body irradiation (TBI) as preconditioning for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) potentially reduces relapse
but results in increased toxicity to vital organs and no survival benefit. Therefore, in the last several years, total
marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) preparative HCT regimens have been developed to safely target
increased doses to sites of disease. This continuation application expands on previous successful dose
escalation strategies using TMLI to enhance the therapeutic gain (dose ratio of bone marrow to vital organs) in
refractory and relapsed leukemia patients, compared to conventional TBI. Phase I TMLI trials demonstrate that
dose escalation is feasible with acceptable toxicities. Initial results are encouraging in patients with refractory or
relapsed leukemia not eligible for standard of care transplant regimens, as exemplified in one study showing a
two-year progression-free survival rate of 27%. However, the disease relapse rate is still high (~65%). To address
this problem, the investigators have developed a state-of-the-art non-invasive hybrid imaging technology, a multi-
modal imaging methodology, that detects a heterogeneous spatial association between acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and the bone marrow environment (BME) to identify areas of FLT-avid high disease burden and potential
sites for disease relapse and to uncover skeletal-wide spatial variations in BME damage or destabilization
(BMED) that may adversely affect bone marrow (BM) engraftment. Thus, based on the knowledge gained in the
last funding period, the objective is to maximize the benefit of tumor cell killing without increasing BME damage
that is reflected by reduced cellularity/hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self- renewal capacity and increased
differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) towards adipogenesis. Initial study reveals that escalated
TMLI radiation doses lead to tolerable BMED. This work will be expanded in Aim 1 to assess spatial and temporal
effects of TMLI on BMED in an ongoing clinical trial using patient-derived biological samples and non-invasive
imaging, namely, whole body, dual energy CT (DECT) and water fat MRI (wfMRI) for longitudinal assessment of
BMED. In Aim 2, a hybrid 3’-deoxy-3’[(18)F] -fluorothymidine positron emission tomography (FLT PET)-DECT-
wfMRI imaging system to assess skeletal-wide spatial distribution of disease and its association with treatment
response (relapse/remission) will be utilized. The feasibility of this functional TMLI (fTMLI) to allow augmented
doses (or dose painting) to areas of FLT-avid high disease burden for targeted specific dose escalation will also
be characterized. In Aim 3, the investigators will use a newly developed mouse model of clinical TMLI to study
how TMLI doses impact BMED and engraftment. Identifying an optimal dose to minimize BMED and maximize
leukemia cell killing will complement the goals of Aims 1 and 2. This strategy has the potential to significantly
improve the safety and efficacy of TMLI as HCT conditioning for AML patients by reducing disease relapse
without significantly increasing toxicity.","631113",

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. There are no effective therapies
available for TBI patients. Thus, there is a compelling need to develop novel therapeutics in order to improve
neurological recovery after TBI. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult multipotent cells that give rise to
various mesodermal cell types. The use of MSCs for tissue repair is of great interest because of their ability to
home to damaged and inflammatory tissues. However, previous studies from us and others show that only a
small proportion of transplanted MSCs actually survive and few MSCs differentiate into neural cells in injured
brain tissues. The predominant mechanisms by which MSCs participate in brain remodeling and functional
recovery are related to their secretion-based paracrine effect rather than a cell replacement effect. Our recent
data suggest that posttraumatic treatment with cell-free exosomes isolated from rat and human MSCs improves
functional recovery in male rats after TBI. Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication.
Exosomes transfer not only proteins and lipids but also genetic materials including mRNAs and microRNAs
(miRNAs) to recipient cells, thereby mediating a variety of biological responses. Our preliminary data further
demonstrate that the labeled exosomes administered intravenously after TBI reach the brain and are
incorporated into brain cells as well as in macrophages in peripheral organs. Our encouraging findings indicate
that MSC-derived exosomes have equivalent restorative effects as their cellular counterparts on brain
remodeling and functional recovery after TBI. Thus, MSC-generated exosomes are novel candidates as a cell-
free therapy that can overcome the obstacles and risks associated with the use of naive or engineered stem
cells or MSCs. While our results are promising, the precise therapeutic mechanisms underlying exosome therapy
for TBI recovery warrant further elucidation. In this proposal, we will first determine therapeutic efficacy of naïve
MSC-exosomes for improvement in functional recovery in male and female rats after TBI. We will then evaluate
the effect of MSC-exosomes on brain neuroplasticity, and growth factor expression as well as on the brain and
peripheral immune response, effects that likely underlie and contribute to functional recovery (Aim 1). We will
then evaluate the role of the miRNA content of the MSC-derived exosomes on brain angiogenesis, neurogenesis,
synaptogenesis, cell death, growth factors and immune responses underlying functional recovery (Aim 2). Finally,
we propose to enhance the therapeutic effects of exosome treatment of TBI by generating and employing tailored
MSC-derived exosomes enriched with the miR-17-92 cluster as a treatment for TBI. In addition, we will
investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular exosome uptake (Aim 3). This proposal is innovative,
and highly translational. This study will provide novel insights into mechanisms underlying the MSC-derived
exosome-promotion of functional recovery after TBI, develop a means to amplify the therapeutic effects of
exosome therapy for TBI, and form the foundation for clinical translation of exosome therapy for TBI.","296297",

Glioblastoma (GBM) comprises >50% of all brain tumors in adults and is the most malignant form with a 5-year
patient survival rate of 3.3%. Standard-of-care treatment involves maximal surgical resection followed by
radiation and chemotherapy (temozolomide); however, as the poor survival rate indicates, these treatments
have not been effective in preventing disease progression. Glioblastomas are highly heterogeneous with a
small subpopulation of neural stem-like cells notorious for their resistance to conventional therapy and known
to be responsible for tumor recurrence and patient death. Therapies that target tumor cells as well as glioma
stem cells (GSCs), while sparing normal cells, would be highly beneficial for these patients. The unique
capacity of mammalian olfactory epithelium in continuous replacing its olfactory receptor neurons by
physiological turnover and following injury throughout life has been attributed to the olfactory ensheathing cells
(OECs), a glial cell type that closely accompany the axons as they grow from the olfactory epithelium into the
olfactory bulb. OECs migrate from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system (CNS), a
critical process in the development and maintenance of the olfactory system and axonal extension after injury
in neural regeneration. OECs release diffusible factors to attract neural progenitors into the rostral migratory
stream and regulate their proliferation and differentiation and to differentiate neural stem cells leading to
neurite extension. Owing to their strong ability to myelinate and guide axonal outgrowth, neuroprotective role,
as well as their immunomodulatory and phagocytic properties, the therapeutic potential of OECs was evaluated
against different neurological pathologies in the clinic and as a carrier for therapeutic transgene to glioma cells
in culture, but their tropism and effect against gliomas in vivo were not studied. Recently, we showed for the
first time that autologous transplantation of mouse OECs can target and deliver therapeutic transgenes to brain
tumors upon intranasal administration, the natural route of OECs to CNS. In this proposal, we will build on this
study and evaluate the potential use of OECs for glioblastoma stem cell therapy by regulating proliferation
and/or differentiation of GSCs, making them susceptible to conventional therapies, reversing immune
supression and activating anti-tumor immunity.","614898",

Glioblastoma (GBM), the grade IV glioma, is among the most lethal of human malignancies, distinguished
by prominent vascularity. GBM is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with a current median survival of
about 14-16 months, largely due to its high resistance to conventional cytotoxic therapies. Overgrown
vasculature characterizes the tumor microenvironment that fuels GBM progression and induces vascular
niche-mediated therapeutic resistance. However, current anti-vascular therapy that primarily targets pro-
angiogenic factors including VEGF, albeit initially groundbreaking, has encountered major difficulties and
failures in treating most malignant solid tumors including GBM, likely due to insufficient eradication or
functional inhibition of tumor-associated endothelial cells (ECs). Our recent studies suggest that EC
plasticity by genetic reprogramming is a driving force that induces EC resistance to anti-angiogenic and
cytotoxic treatments. Here, our preliminary study by single-cell transcriptome analysis of tumor-associated
ECs reveals that ECs acquire mesenchymal and stemness-like gene signature in a genetically engineered
mouse GBM model. Utilizing human specimens and EC lineage-tracing systems, our studies reveal robust
treatment resistance in GBM-associated ECs. Our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that genetic reprogramming
into mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-like cells induces EC chemoresistance through Wnt activation in GBM.
Therefore, we hypothesize that mesenchymal and stemness-like genetic reprogramming in tumor ECs
induces therapy resistance in GBM. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following aims: 1) Define
the molecular mechanism underlying EC plasticity and treatment resistance with a focus on Wnt activation;
2) Determine the in vivo role of c-Met/Wnt-mediated EC plasticity in tumor progression; and 3) Test
experimental therapy that combines EC plasticity inhibition with radio/chemotherapy or anti-angiogenic
therapy in orthotopic mouse GBM models. Successful completion of the proposed work will provide novel
insights into tumor microenvironment-dependent treatment resistance, and may lead to development of a
new therapeutic strategy by targeting endothelial plasticity in cancer.","358875",

The elderly have increased susceptibility to periodontitis, a prevalent inflammatory disease that causes
destruction of the tooth-supporting tissues (periodontium). This increased susceptibility is likely caused by
alterations to the immuno-inflammatory status and/or regenerative potential of the periodontal tissue. Impaired
tissue regeneration may be traced back to age-related alterations in the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) niche of
the periodontal ligament (PDL), harboring the osteoprogenitors. Del-1 is a homeostatic protein secreted by
distinct tissue resident cells: It regulates the recruitment of neutrophils (endothelial cell-derived Del-1) and the
efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils (macrophage-derived Del-1), thus Del-1 controls both the initiation and
resolution of inflammation. Additional research has shown that Del-1 is produced in the PDL and promotes
osteoblastic differentiation as well as induces the formation of new alveolar bone during resolution of
experimental periodontitis. However, Del-1 expression is severely diminished in old age. This project investigates
the overarching hypothesis that the aging-related Del-1 deficiency may contribute to the dysregulation of
osteogenesis, thereby leading to defective periodontal bone regeneration in old age. This proposal comprises
two specific aims and focuses on relevant animal model-based mechanistic and intervention studies, including
mice with lineage-specific deletions or overexpression of Del-1 or its receptor β3 integrin. In Aim 1, it is proposed
that Del-1 promotes osteoblastic differentiation by acting via its RGD motif on β3 integrin in osteolineage
progenitors. Aim 2 involves the elucidation of the mechanisms by which Del-1 regulates osteogenesis in vivo
and, moreover, examines the consequences of aging-related Del-1 deficiency on bone regeneration. It is also
proposed that impaired bone regeneration in old mice can be reversed by local administration of Del-1. On the
basis that the regenerative defect of the aged PDL-MSC niche is reversible and regulated by the extrinsic
microenvironment, the findings of this proposal may potentially pave the way to novel Del-1-based approaches
to rejuvenate niche functionality and thus enhance periodontal bone regeneration in old age.","300746",

Over a 10 year
period, more than 130,000 active service members received diagnoses of disc degeneration, with annual
incidence rates more than doubling during this time. Current treatment approaches are mostly conservative,
and in severe cases, patients may undergo surgical procedures such as spinal fusion, which do not maintain or
restore native tissue structure or mechanical function. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attractive options
for cell-based therapies due to their potential for autologous harvest, expansion, and re-implantation making
them highly translational. A key challenge to successful application of MSCs for disc regeneration is the unique
biochemical and physical microenvironment cells are exposed to upon implantation. To overcome this
challenge, one strategy is preconditioning of MSCs by exposure to hypoxia, soft physical substrates and
developmentally-relevant stimuli during monolayer expansion in order to enhance their in vivo performance in
applications for disc regeneration. It has also been shown that MSCs isolated from bone marrow are highly
heterogeneous, both within and between donors, exhibiting distinct phenotypic characteristics, including
sensitivity to microenvironmental stress in culture. Aim 1 will therefore establish the in vitro preconditioning and
donor characteristics that maximize the survival and extracellular matrix production of MSCs in the oxygen and
nutrient-poor disc microenvironment. Preclinical demonstration of the long term efficacy of disc therapies with
respective to structural and functional regeneration, and alleviation of symptoms, using rigorously validated,
clinically-relevant outcome measures is critical to their successful future clinical translation. Our team recently
established a preclinical goat model of disc degeneration that recapitulates key characteristics of human disc
degeneration. Therefore, in Aim 2 we will establish the long term efficacy of a combined hydrogel and

an established preclinical goat model of disc degeneration. To maximize the clinical impact of our findings we
will further refine our goat model to include progressive and clinically relevant functional, imaging, and
molecular biomarkers of pain and disability. Finally, in Aim 3 we will take an additional important step towards
clinical application of this therapy by establishing that adult human MSCs respond to preconditioning, and
undertake transcriptome-wide screening studies to identify unique molecular signatures that predispose MSCs
from certain human donors to enhanced performance and response to preconditioning."," ",

 The prevalence of obesity is rising to epidemic proportions. Obesity often leads to endocrine and metabolic
derangements, and reduction in its complications could diminish morbidity and mortality, and produce large
cost savings. Currently, bariatric surgery is considered the most effective treatment for sustainable weight loss.
 Obesity triggers cellular damage in multiple organs, partly via induction of premature senescence. This
cellular program is characterized by a permanent cell-cycle arrest and altered cellular function, which prompts
cells to acquire a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), a distinctive secretome that involves
secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Aberrant accumulation of senescent cells exhibiting the
SASP phenotype exerts noxious effects on neighboring cells, and drives tissue injury and the aging phenotype.
 Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), a ubiquitous cellular repair mechanism, may be injured by ambient risk
factors. In obesity adipose tissue-derived MSC might develop cellular senescence (CS) and acquire a SASP
phenotype, suggesting that obesity may impede endogenous cellular repair capacity. However, the effects of
obesity on CS in human MSC, and the impact of MSC CS on their reparative capacity, remain unknown.
 Our hypothesis is that obesity evokes senescence in human MSC, which interferes with their capacity
to repair injured kidneys. We hypothesize that this impaired MSC function is partly mediated by a
phenotype shift in MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) that drive their paracrine effects, but would
be reversible upon senolytic pre-treatment of MSC, or following patient weight loss. We will use unique and
novel model systems and techniques to pursue specific aims showing that: Specific Aim 1: In human
subjects, obesity induces CS in adipose tissue MSC, and interferes with their repair capacity in injured mouse
kidneys. Specific Aim 2: The functional impairment in adipose tissue MSC from obese human subjects is
partly mediated by a phenotype shift in their membrane-derived EV. Specific Aim 3: MSC-CS and SASP in
obese human subjects would be reversible upon bariatric surgery.
 The proposed studies may uncover novel mechanisms, involving impaired circulating and tissue cellular
repair systems, which underlie complications of human obesity. Furthermore, they may establish a novel
strategy to blunt this injurious cellular senescence, and thereby boost endogenous kidney repair capability.","577429",

 Advancing our understanding of the mechanisms that control bone mass and osteoblast differentiation is crucial
to unveil the pathogenesis of skeletal diseases and identify therapeutical approaches for their treatment.
Osteoblastic cells operate in a low oxygen (hypoxic) environment. The transcription factors Hypoxia Inducible
Factor-1a (HIF1) and HIF2 are critical mediators of the cellular response to hypoxia. Both transcription factors
are expressed in cells of the osteoblast lineage. HIF1 was reported to be a positive regulator of bone formation
and osteoblast differentiation. Conversely, the role of HIF2 in the control of bone mass and osteoblast biology is
still poorly understood. We recently generated mutant mice carrying loss-of-function and gain-of-function
mutations of HIF2 in mesenchymal progenitors of the limb bud by using PRX1-Cre. Preliminary analysis of these
mutant mice suggested that HIF2 is a negative regulator of osteoblastogenesis and bone formation through a
direct action on cells on the osteoblast lineage. Mechanistically, we gathered preliminary evidence that Sox9,
which is emerging as a negative regulator of osteoblast differentiation, is likely to mediate the HIF2-dependent
impairment of osteoblastogenesis. Our findings constitute a paradigm shift as activation of the HIF signaling
pathway has been associated with increased, rather than decreased, osteoblast activity. Moreover, they imply
that, as in other cell types, HIF1 and HIF2 have opposing functions in osteoblastic cells. Also, our preliminary
data showed that loss of HIF2 in mesenchymal progenitors of the limb bud increases bone mass in both
trabecular and cortical bone. HIF2 can be selectively inhibited by small molecules, some of which are currently
in clinical trials in patients carrying pathologies associated with high levels of HIF2 activity such as clear cell
renal carcinoma. Therefore, determining whether and how HIF2 controls osteoblastogenesis and bone mass
not only will expand and deepen our understanding of the role of the hypoxia signaling pathway in the skeleton
but could also provide a novel target for the treatment of low bone mass seen in chronic diseases, osteoporosis
and with aging. In this proposal, we thus seek to demonstrate that osteoblastic HIF2 regulates bone mass during
skeletal development and in adulthood (Aim 1). Moreover, we will establish whether osteoblastic HIF2 controls
osteoblastogenesis through a direct action on mesenchymal progenitors and in a Sox9-dependent manner (Aim

Trauma- and cancer-induced tissue damage is common in the mandible. Critical failures associated with current
grafting treatments, like osteonecrosis, occur due to poor local conditions and limited integration between the
graft and the host tissue. Recent studies show that cartilage grafts produce well-vascularized and integrated
bone regeneration similar to an isograft, indicating that chondrocytes can form bones. As a mechanism, cell
trans-differentiation from chondrocytes into bone cells has been demonstrated. Yet, membranous osteogenesis
is currently considered the sole mechanism in the formation and repair of mandible body, despite two types of
cartilage (Meckel’s cartilage, MC; and Rostral Process, RP) present during mandible growth. Similar to the
mouse model, a RP-MC-like structure is identified in human fetuses and infants. To address whether
endochondrogenesis contributes to the growth and repair of mandible body, a series of studies using
complementary approaches has been performed. The key findings are: 1) the mandible body is composed of
both membranous and endochondral bones; 2) hypertrophic chondrocytes in MC and RP directly trans-
differentiate to bone cells instead of directly entering apoptosis; 3) RP-MC is one continuous cartilage; 4) a new
Condensed Mesenchymal Progenitor (CMP) zone is identified, which provides new cell sources for RP and MC
expansion; and 5) endochondrogenesis plays a key function in the mandible repair via a switch mechanism from
the default program (membranous bone) to a trauma repair program (endochondral bone), where
chondrogenesis (with limited requirement of angiogenesis) occurs first, followed by chondrocyte trans-
differentiation into bone. Based on these findings, the central hypothesis is that the mandible body is composed
of both endochondral and membranous bones, and that endochondrogenesis plays a key role in mandible repair.
To test this central hypothesis, three highly related, yet independent Specific Aims are proposed: 1) To determine
how MC and RP contribute to mandible formation via chondrocyte trans-differentiation; 2) To delineate the
mechanism by which RP is derived from the CMP, and the CMP-RP, a growth-plate like structure, converges
and elongates the two ends of MCs during mandible growth at cellular and molecular levels; 3) To determine
how endochondrogenesis contributes to mandible repair via a switch mechanism from the default development
program (membranous bone) to a trauma repair program (endochondral bone) through a change in the stem cell
fate. Completion of this project will 1) demonstrate that the CMP-RP-MC complex contributes to mandible growth
via the trans-differentiation of RP-MC chondrocytes into bone cells; and 2) identify some of key factors that are
responsible for the switch from membranous osteogenesis to endochondrogenesis via a change of the stem cell
fate in the repair process. These results will likely revise the current concept, provide new knowledge in this
largely unknown but vital area, and create a foundation for developing novel approaches, which will ultimately
accelerate future mandible trauma repair processes.","117860",

Mesenchymal nephron progenitor cells (MNPs) give rise to all nephron tubules in the mammalian kidney.
Premature depletion of these cells leads to low nephron numbers, increasing the risk of high blood pressure
and various renal diseases. In order to intervene in premature depletion of MNPs, we must better understand
how the MNP population is maintained during development. To date, the processes required for the
maintenance of MNPs in vivo are poorly understood. Our preliminary data suggest that Hedgehog signaling
plays important roles in MNP maintenance. Hedgehog signaling regulates numerous developmental
processes. Upon binding of Hedgehog to Patched, Smoothened (Smo) is relieved from Patched-mediated
inhibition, initiating the signaling cascade. To test the potential role of Hedgehog signaling in MNPs, we
generated Smo mutant kidneys with Six2Cre and found that MNPs lacking Smo were prematurely depleted
during development, resulting in a 50% reduction in nephron number. Our transcriptional profiling data from
Smo loss- and gain-of-function mutant MNPs show a linear correlation between Ptch1 expression and Smo
dosage, suggesting that MNPs do respond to Hedgehog signaling. Our data show that Fox transcription factors
are downstream targets of Hedgehog signaling in MNPs and that loss of Hedgehog signaling results in the
activation of Notch signaling, a major differentiation signal for MNPs. Based on our findings, we hypothesize
that ligand-dependent Hedgehog signaling maintains MNPs by repressing Notch signal and activating Fox
genes. We propose to (1) perform genetic analyses to determine if Hedgehog signaling increases self-renewal
of MNPs and nephron endowment, (2) test if genetic attenuation or pharmacological inhibition of Notch
signaling rescues premature depletion of Smo mutant MNPs, and (3) test if loss of Fox transcription factors
results in premature depletion of MNPs and lower nephron numbers. Successful completion of these aims will
(1) provide novel insights into how Hedgehog signaling impacts nephron endowment, (2) identify direct target
genes operating downstream of Hedgehog signaling in MNPs, (3) determine if Fox transcription factors play
key roles in nephrogenesis, and (4) improve in vitro renal organoid cultures.","505892",

Osteoporosis is a common clinical condition characterized by low bone mass that increases the risk of fragility
fractures in the elderly population. Since bone formation is clearly impaired in osteoporotic patients, a more
complete understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms that regulate bone metabolism is likely to
lead to the development of novel therapies. Therefore, identification of novel molecular pathways which
influence bone formation is crucial to the development of clinical treatments to combat osteoporosis. Our
previous work has definitively established that the anti-osteogenic transcription factor, retinoic acid receptor-
related orphan receptor-beta (Rorβ) plays an inhibitory role in osteoblast differentiation. Increasing expression
levels of Rorβ during physiological aging contributes to bone loss, as mice lacking Rorβ exhibit higher bone
mass through activation of the bone anabolic Wnt pathway. This leads to the notion that inhibition of Rorβ may
represent a novel paradigm to increase bone mass throughout the aging process. We hypothesized that
microRNAs (miRs) may control Rorβ levels, and found that a specific miR, miR-219a-5p (miR-219a), the top
predicted Rorβ-regulatory miR, exhibits an inverse expression pattern to Rorβ, suggesting a potential
Rorβ/miR-219a regulatory axis in bone. We demonstrate that miR-219a directly regulates Rorβ levels in
osteoblasts, that delivery of miR-219a mimics enhances osteoblast differentiation, and that miR-219a
antagonists suppress differentiation. We further show that miR-219a increases the activity of the bone anabolic
Wnt pathway. Therefore, we propose that miR-219a is bone anabolic and may be used to preserve bone mass
with age, possibly through increasing Wnt pathway activity. Using a novel mouse model where we can activate
miR-219a expression in a tissue-specific manner, in Aim 1 we will determine the effects of miR-219a in Rorβ-
expressing cells on adult bone mass or following a fracture, with the hypothesis that downregulation of Rorβ
through miR-219a will increase bone mass and accelerate fracture healing. In Aim 2, we will explore the more
general effects of miR-219a in bone homeostasis by activating miR-219a in various bone cell lineages, with the
hypothesis that downregulation of Rorβ, and/or other miR-219a targets in these lineages, will increase bone
mass with age. Finally, in Aim 3 we will perform in vitro experiments to explore the molecular mechanism of
how miR-219a regulates the Wnt pathway and determine whether direct targeting of Rorβ by miR-219a affects
Wnt activity and bone cell function. Completion of these pivotal studies will not only provide a more complete
understanding of miR-219a function in bone, but if positive will also provide a strong justification for pursuing
miR-219a mimics as a novel therapeutic strategy to stimulate bone formation in various clinical conditions.","293355",

Despite advances in treatment strategies, xerostomia (or dry mouth) remains a permanent and devastating side
effect of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, reducing the quality of life for ~50,000 cancer patients each
year in the U.S. We aim to develop tissue-engineering approaches to restore salivary function. We have isolated
human salivary gland stem/progenitor cells (hS/PCs) from patients prior to radiotherapy. We have created
tunable hydrogel matrices that maintain the progenitor status, induce lineage-specific differentiation and promote
the development of organized multicellular spheroids from dispersed hS/PCs. Separately, we have engineered
salivary gland microtissues that exhibit coordinated calcium activation between hS/PC-derived acini-like core
and the surrounding myoepithelial cells. However, a functional gland with extensive branching, polarized acini,
and interconnected ducts has not yet been realized. Here, we propose a bottom-up approach to establish
functional salivary glands using multicellular assemblies of defined shape, geometry and composition. We will
synthesize hydrogel scaffolds that recapitulate key features of the basement membrane and the interstitial matrix
in the developing organ. We will reconstitute the vascular, neural and mesenchymal components in the
engineered environment to foster tissue morphogenesis in vitro and to maintain tissue homeostasis in vivo. In
Aim 1, we will exploit tetrazine ligation, the bioorthogonal and highly efficient cycloaddition reaction between s-
tetrazine and strained alkenes, for the establishment of cell-instructive matrices. We will adapt our established
methods to generate microgels containing sequestered acetylcholine analog, carbachol (CCh). In Aim 2, we will
employ non-adhesive hydrogel microwells to produce multicellular epithelial assemblies consisting of hS/PCs
and CCh depots. The resultant microtissue will be encased in a synthetic basement membrane with bioactive
peptides to stimulate the development of proacrinar progenitor phenotype. We will generate endothelial
microtissues consisting of a core of human salivary gland endothelial cells (hSECs) and a shell of human
mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). We will co-culture the epithelial and endothelial microtissues in a synthetic
extracellular matrix with defined cell-guidance cues to aid in the establishment of a hierarchically integrated
tissue assembly. In Aim 3, the engineered gland with integrated microvasculature and conjugated neurotrophic
factor, neurturin, will be implanted in the resected parotid bed of athymic rats. Enzymatically triggered release of
neurturin will promote implant innervation. Tissue ultrastructure, biomarker expression, gland morphology,
biointegration and function will be assessed under various construct configurations. We will interrogate how the
engineered microenvironments stimulate differentiation, trigger polarization and promote branching. The overall
hypothesis is that hS/PCs co-cultured with hSECs/hMSCs in 3D synthetic matrices displaying biochemical,
geometrical and mechanical cues identified from the native organs will assemble into functional salivary tissues.
Our investigations will help define bioengineering approaches toward the management of xerostomia.","412261",

development and bioinformatics. The Investigators have developed preliminary data from analysis of human
lung cancer specimens and preclinical Genetically Engineered Mouse Models (GEMMs) of KRAS mutant
NSCLC that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) status of tumor cells is critical to their therapeutic
response to MEK inhibitors, with the epithelial state producing profound sensitivity to MEK inhibitors and the
mesenchymal state producing resistance, even in mutant KRAS tumors. Further, we have published that the
microRNA-200-ZEB1 axis regulates EMT, the immune microenvironment of tumors and subsequent response
to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
 Based upon preliminary data, we hypothesize that: 1. Tumor cell EMT produces heterogeneity in KRAS
mutant tumors by suppressing MAPK pathway signaling, 2. The altered tumor immune microenvironment
resulting from tumor cell EMT confers targetable vulnerabilities to new immune therapies, 3. Combination
immune checkpoint inhibitors and signaling pathway inhibitors will provide an effective complementary
targeting strategy for mutant KRAS NSCLC. We will address these hypotheses by: i) evaluating the role of
EMT in de novo and acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors in preclinical models of lung adenocarcinoma, ii)
determining the effects of MEK inhibitors on the tumor immune microenvironment and testing the efficacy of
their combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors to enhance response in preclinical models of KRAS
mutant lung adenocarcinoma, and iii) characterizing the relationship of EMT to MAPK pathway activation in
human lung cancer samples, and the markers of sensitivity/resistance to combination anti-PD-L1/MEK inhibitor
treatment in clinical trial specimens.","329400",

Glioblastoma (GBM) continues to be an invariably fatal malignancy with limited treatment options. Our
laboratory studies tumor metabolism and its potential to serve as a novel therapeutic target. Through a series
of investigations, our group has identified that the diverse tumor ecology implicit in this malignancy contributes
to considerable intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity and dynamic metabolic reprogramming, allowing GBM
cells to adapt and proliferate under diverse, microenvironmental stresses. Specifically, through integrative
cross-platform analyses coupling metabolomics with genomics in patient-derived tumors, we identified
enhanced fatty acid oxidization (FAO) as a metabolic node in GBM driven by a transcriptional program
designed to import and utilize fatty acids from the tumor microenvironment. This metabolic phenotype was
specific to the mesenchymal subtype in GBM and recapitulated in preclinical models. Functional analyses
uncovered specific roles these fatty acids play in gliomagenesis, which are dependent upon nutrient
availability. In a state of glucose deprivation, mesenchymal GBM cells utilize these exogenous fatty acids to
serve as a vital, alternate source of ATP, whereas in nutrient favorable conditions, the intermediary metabolism
of FAO acts as a metabolic cue to drive a transcriptional program supporting cellular proliferation and
mesenchymal differentiation. Accordingly, inhibiting FAO in standard, nutrient rich conditions led to decreased
proliferation, however, robust energetic stress and non-apoptotic cell death was observed in mesenchymal
GBM cells in the context of glucose deprivation. In this application, we propose to extend these promising
findings by defining molecular mechanisms governing enhanced FAO in GBM (Aim 1), delineating the multiple
roles FAO may play in gliomagenesis in the context of this tumor’s diverse tumor ecology (Aim 2), and evaluate
the translational potential for eliciting metabolic synthetic lethality in GBM through energetic stress (Aim 3).","300153",

This new R01 builds on discoveries during the R37 period (2008-2018) that established epigenetic mechanisms
(miRNAs, histone modifications) regulating osteoblast differentiation. We characterized for the first time a
“signature” of specific histone modifications that are associated with dynamic changes in gene expression during
the temporal progression of osteogenesis. These histone modifications also predicted “enhancers”, which are
critical cis-regulatory elements that contribute to local gene expression. We now propose to examine the recently
recognized “super enhancer” domains (SEDs) that include regulatory elements for multiple transcription factors
that have emerged as key regulators of cell phenotypes. SEDs function in chromatin organization via long range
intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions that coordinate control of gene cohorts responsible for lineage
specification and distinct cell identity. Our preliminary studies have identified a subset of SEDs that we now
propose are putative “bone-essential super-enhancers” and candidates for the important decision stage of
commitment to osteogenesis from MSCs. We hypothesize that super-enhancer domains are differentially
activated from the undifferentiated MSC to the osteoblast commitment stage, and function to establish the
osteogenic phenotype by coordinately regulating gene networks and contributing to higher order chromatin
organization that supports cell identity. Our studies will in: Aim1- analyze the functional effects of prioritized SEDs
we have identified related to osteoblastogenesis and mature bone activities through directed inhibition and
activation of SEDs using CRISPR/Cas9 in MSCs; Aim 2- determine the chromosomal domains that interact
with SEDs to control multiple genes and networks that commit MSCs to the osteoblast phenotype through
chromatin organization; and Aim 3- demonstrate in mouse models that using CRISPR activated SEDs in MSCs
will stimulate bone formation.
Impact: These studies pioneer a new level of gene regulation for MSC lineage commitment to osteogenesis,
based on an emerging understanding of SED functions in other tissues but have been minimally studied in bone.
By characterizing SED mechanisms related to chromatin organization and stabilization in MSCs, we will discover
novel mechanisms of multi-dimensional coordinate control of transcriptional hubs and protein complexes within
an SED that is responsible for establishing commitment to the osteoblast phenotype. Importantly, knowledge of
the chromatin organization that stabilizes the osteogenic phenotype impacts on future novel treatment strategies
for skeletal disorders.","455746",

Chemical burns to the eye are potentially blinding ocular injuries and constitute an ocular emergency requiring
immediate assessment and initiation of treatment. They also constitute between 7-10% of the eye injuries in the
general population. Out of all chemical injuries, alkali injuries are the most common and the most deleterious.
Recurrent epithelial erosions, severe stromal inflammation, neovascularization, corneal ulceration and
perforation are all prevalent complications of alkali burns. Currently, there is no successful treatment for severe
damage to the cornea or to maintain corneal transparency. This proposal builds upon our previous findings that
the lipid mediator, lipoxin A4 (LxA4), stimulates epithelial and endothelial wound healing, is involved in the
reparative action of epidermal growth factor, and inhibits the inflammatory response stimulated after corneal
injury. In addition, after severe alkali burn, there is a shortage of repair fibroblasts in ulcerated corneas, which is
needed to synthesize components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and to repair the stroma. The organizing
hypothesis of the proposed research is that controlling the intense inflammatory response with LxA4
and reconstituting the ECM by stromal cell transplantation in a severe alkali burn model will avoid
ulceration and neovascularization, thereby improving the visual outcome after severe ocular chemical
injuries. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will use a severe rat
alkali burn model (both sexes) to assess the action of LxA4 in in vivo clinical parameters and in inflammatory
cytokines and conversion of macrophages type 1 (M1) to M2 by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. In
Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the anti-inflammatory action of the limbal stromal cells and combine treatment
with LxA4 defined in Specific Aim 1 with cell transplantation of repair fibroblasts in the rat alkali burn model. We
will determine clinical scores, presence of inflammatory cells, and ECM components after an early (3 days) and
late (5 days) cell transplantation. The proposed studies, if successful, will target new approaches to investigate
a novel treatment to control intense inflammation, to preserve the globe, and possibly, to restore transparency.","178237",

Cells in a variety of contexts migrate towards soluble chemical cues in a process known as chemotaxis.
Despite nearly a century of study, the mechanistic underpinnings of chemotaxis remain incompletely
understood. Spatial gradients of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and other chemoattractants direct
the movements of mesenchymal cells in tissues to coordinate and accelerate physiologically important
processes such as wound healing, and mesenchymal chemotaxis has been implicated in pathological
conditions such as cardiovascular and fibrotic diseases. Despite the central role that fibroblasts and other
mesenchymal cells play in wound healing and other disease processes such as metastatic cancer and
fibrosis, a rigorous understanding of mechanisms governing the directed migration of mesenchymal cells
is only recently emerging. To advance further, a quantitative, integrative approach is required.
Specifically, it is necessary to elucidate how the central regulatory pathways network with others and how
they are coordinated with respect to subcellular location and time to affect cell behavior. In the context of
directed mesenchymal cell migration, another layer of complexity is the variation of gradient conditions
(midpoint concentration/surface density and steepness). Enabled by new engineering advances, we are
poised to tackle these new questions related to chemotaxis and haptotaxis and to their combinatorial
influence in multi-cue settings. Our Specific Aims are as follows:
Aim 1: Decoding the dynamics of multiple signaling axes that shape mesenchymal chemotaxis.
We will test the hypothesis that protrusion dynamics are governed by the metastable push/pull of Arp2/3
complex and NMII activities, which are insufficiently biased by a chemotactic gradient. With stable
polarization of active PKC in the most-up-gradient protrusion, the inactivation of NMII there provides a
‘port in the storm’ for pro-Arp2/3 signaling to mediate more productive protrusion.
Aim 2: Probing the dynamics of haptotactic sensing and signal amplification. We hypothesize that
differential integrin engagement on ECM gradients drives significant cell migration bias through feedback
amplification of the pro-Arp2/3 signaling axis. If so, it would imply that haptotactic gradients are able to
bias pro-Arp2/3 signaling in mesenchymal cells to an extent that chemotactic gradients cannot.
Aim 3: Defining gradient synergy and prioritization in multi-cue scenarios. Despite the relevance
for guidance of mesenchymal cells in vivo, it is completely unknown how cells respond to co-presentation
of the two gradient types in a controlled setting. Considering how chemotaxis and haptotaxis affect
dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in fibroblasts, we hypothesize that the two gradients
synergize when presented in a parallel orientation. By presenting the gradients in an antiparallel or
orthogonal orientation, we will determine how cells prioritize the two types of cues.","259879",

 Heart failure (HF) has a high morbidity and mortality. Its incidence is increasing worldwide. One hallmark of
HF is endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction which initially manifests as impaired endothelium-dependent
vasodilation of the epicardial coronary arteries and the microvasculature. Another important hallmark of HF is
the presence of interstitial fibrosis, which increases myocardial stiffness and cardiac work, elevates diastolic
pressures and increases pulmonary interstitial fluid to impair oxygenation. Genetic lineage tracing showed that
most HF fibroblasts originate from tissue-resident fibroblasts, which expand and differentiate into
myofibroblasts. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating fibroblast activation and myofibroblast
transdifferentiation remain poorly understood. Intercellular communication, especially EC-fibroblast crosstalk,
plays a substantial modulatory role in the normal and failing heart. More specifically, factors secreted by
cardiac microvascular EC modulate cardiac performance and cardiac fibrosis. Thus, targeting endothelial
dysfunction has the potential to be a promising therapeutic avenue for HF.
 Recently, we and other groups discovered that genes important for the control of cell identity exhibit a
unique epigenetic signature, e.g., broad enrichment of the activating histone modification H3K4me3 and super-
enhancer marks. These discoveries prompted our pilot work to develop the first computational model for the
discovery of new EC master regulators. This novel model employs an analysis of both the epigenetic
landscape as well as the gene expression network. It successfully recaptured known EC identity genes with
high sensitivity and accuracy. The model further revealed a number of top ranked genes with no reported role
in EC, making them promising candidates as novel EC identity genes. One of the most top-ranked genes is
transcription factor 4 (TCF4), which displays typical features of cell identity gene in EC.
 Interestingly, we have preliminary data showing that TCF4 function is a master regulator that maintains EC
identity. Further, TCF4 is downregulated in cardiac ECs of HF patients compared to non-failing controls. The
silencing of TCF4 in EC leads to an increase of EC-secreted proteins TGFβ1, which stimulate fibroblast
activation and myofibroblasts transdifferentiation, and thus promote cardiac fibrosis. In this proposal, we will
investigate the role of TCF4 in EC identity maintenance. We will further investigate the role of TCF4 in the
crosstalk between ECs and fibroblasts, and reveal TCF4 as a therapy target to prevent cardiac fibrosis in HF.
Successful completion of this proposal will be the first to define TCF4 as a novel EC master regulator that
maintains EC phenotype and function. We will uncover an overlooked determinant of HF -- loss of EC identity.
TCF4 dysregulation disturbs EC-fibroblast crosstalk within the heart, aggravating cardiac fibrosis in HF.
Therapeutic modulation of EC-specific TCF4 delivery may be a novel and promising approach for treating HF.","501703",

Glioblastoma (GBM), a lethal human brain tumor, is made up of multiple molecular subtypes, suggesting that
therapy could be targeted to particular subtypes. Yet all newly diagnosed GBM patients are treated with a
similar therapeutic regimen, which results in overall poor patient outcomes. GBM tumors contain stem-like cells
(GSCs) that contribute to tumor initiation, growth, and resistance to standard-of-care temozolomide (TMZ) and
ionizing radiation (IR). Thus, GSCs present an excellent system in which to study the biology of GBM and
develop and evaluate targeted therapeutic approaches to GBM. Our long-term goal is to develop mechanism-
based therapeutic approaches to significantly advance the care of GBM patients. Our laboratory discovered
the transcriptional repressor REST as a stem cell promoter, and thus a critical oncogenic regulator, in
medulloblastoma. We and others discovered that REST also regulates oncogenesis in GBM and that tumors
with GSCs expressing high levels of REST (HR-GSCs) are molecularly and biologically distinct from tumors
with GSCs expressing low levels of REST (LR-GSCs). Further, GBM patients with an HR tumor transcriptome
signature have shorter survival than patients with an LR tumor signature, similar to our results with HR-GSC
versus LR-GSC tumors in mouse models. These studies have suggested that REST is a potential therapeutic
target in HR-GBM tumors. Yet there is no REST-specific therapeutic approach for stratified HR-GSC tumors.
The goal of this project is to determine therapeutic approaches for HR-GSC tumors using mouse intracranial
tumor models. First, information obtained here will determine whether targeting HR-GBM tumors with REST-
specific inhibitor, REST-VP16, is a valuable therapeutic approach for HR-GBM. Second, Information obtained
here will determine whether targeting HR-GBM tumors with REST downstream miR targets via exosome-
mediated delivery would promote therapeutic approaches for HR-GBM. Third, we will determine the underlying
regulatory network changes and transcriptome signatures in selected tumors with and without treatment
conditions. Such regulatory networks will provide information about changes in treatment-dependent
downstream pathways and targets. The transcriptome signatures could be useful to measure treatment
progression in a clinical setting. Fourth, we will determine the homing mechanism of Exosome-mediated
delivery of miRs to HR-tumors. Information obtained here will aid in designing exosomes with enhanced

PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Treatment of blood diseases can be improved with better definition of hematopoietic stem cells and the
cellular elements that constitute the hematopoietic niche. This is true when a single marker can identify both
stem cells and these cell types and play a critical role in determining the functional capacity of hematopoietic
stem cells and the competence of the hematopoietic niche. We will investigate the role of a marker, CD166 that
we have been examining for a number of years to determine how it impacts the function of both stem cells and
the hematopoietic niche.","NIDDK","10339403","12/29/2021 12:00:00 AM","PA-18-484","5R01DK108342-04","5","R01","DK","108342","04"," ","HATTANGADI, SHILPA MANOHAR","2/1/2019 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2023 12:00:00 AM","Molecular and Cellular Hematology Study Section[MCH]"," ","1876445","SROUR, EDWARD F","KACENA, MELISSA A","07","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","603007902","SHHBRBAPSM35","603007902","SHHBRBAPSM35","US","39.780714","-86.174977","577806","INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS","INDIANAPOLIS","IN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","462022915","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2022 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2022 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2022"," "," ","NIDDK","202500","116437"," ","The phenotypic makeup and functional capacity of murine and human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) has
been exhaustively investigated making HSC one of the most-characterized groups of cells in mammalian
biology. Still, not a single functional marker has been previously identified that is common to both murine and
human HSC while being also expressed on at least three important cellular components of the hematopoietic
niche (HN), namely osteoblasts (OB), endothelia cells (EC), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Our focus on
CD166 began when we first established that CD166 identifies OB that mediate a hematopoiesis enhancing
activity. We also published that CD166 is expressed on normal murine and human HSC and plays a key role in
determining their functional capacity and the competence of the HN. We recently confirmed that CD166 is
expressed on a subset of EC and nestin+ MSC. Since CD166 is capable of mediating hetero- and homophilic
cell-cell interactions, we propose that CD166 serves as both ligand and receptor of HSC interactions with
cellular elements of the niche and is an important regulator of the competence of the HN and of stem
cell function. HSC from CD166-/- mice engraft poorly in lethally irradiated hosts. On the other hand CD166-/-
mice do not support the engraftment of LT-HSC suggesting that loss of CD166 abrogates the competence of
the HN. Marrow-homed LSK cells from wildtype (WT) donors lodged closer to the endosteum of host mice than
similar cells from knockout (KO) animals suggesting that engraftment is adversely impacted by the lack of
HSC-OB homophilic CD166-interactions7. Single-cell RNAseq analysis of WT and CD166-/- CD150+CD48- LSK
cells incubated with immobilized CD166 protein revealed that engagement of CD166 on these cells activated
cytokine signaling, epigenetic pathways, stem cell pluripotency genes, and mitochondria-related signaling
pathways. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that CD166 is a functional marker required for HSC-
niche interactions that support the competence of the hematopoietic niche. We also believe that
preferential CD166 homophilic interactions in the niche contribute to HSC regulation and maintenance
of the hematopoietic potential of stem cells. We will test these hypotheses by investigating 2 aims: 1) Test
the hypothesis that CD166 expression on OB, EC, and MSC in the hematopoietic niche is required for the
competence of the hematopoietic niche and 2) Test the hypothesis that hematopoietic stem cells lacking
CD166 homophilic interactions with OB, EC, and MSC in the niche fail to develop normally and acquire an
engraftment defect. The significance of this proposal is that it will examine the role of a new and unique
functional marker of human and murine HSC and will investigate the impact of CD166 modulation on stem cell
function. The novelty of this proposal stems from its potential to implicate CD166 in the regulation of the HN
and HSC that reside in and interact with CD166-rich cellular elements of this microenvironment. These studies
have the potential to define how homophilic CD166 interactions promote HSC self-renewal.","318937",

These complications are treated with surgical procedures causing significant morbidity and even mortality,

mice of a different age share a blood supply) showing that exposure to a young circulation and young
macrophage cells rejuvenates fracture repair in older mice. In our preliminary data we used cell lineage tracing
analysis and parabiosis experiments to determine the developmental source of macrophage in fracture repair,
and found these derived from a subpopulation of cells of yolk sac origin. Interestingly these cells reside in the
spleen and are recruited through the circulation during bone repair. As mice age, this subpopulation of cells
becomes depleted. In this proposal we study the role of this cell population and the factors they produce in the
rejuvenation of fracture repair by undertaking the following aims:
 1) Identify the role of macrophages derived from yolk sac progenitors in the rejuvenation of
fracture repair. Heterochronic parabiosis in which these cells can be labeled or depleted will be investigated
to define the contribution of young cells from this population of macrophage cells that can improve the quality
of fracture repair in older animals.
 2) Determine the function of genes expressed in unique macrophage subpopulations present in
young mice in bone repair: We used single cell RNA sequencing and found a unique subpopulation of
macrophages cells present in bone repair in only young animals. Mice lacking genes which encode for
secreted proteins in various macrophage populations will be used in heterochronic parabiosis to determine
their contribution to the rejuvenation of fracture repair.
 3) Define how specific macrophage populations and the proteins they secrete alter
mesenchymal differentiation in fracture repair. Our prior work showed an important role for beta-catenin in
mesenchymal cell differentiation and in fracture repair rejuvenation. Here we will use in-vitro approaches to
determine how specific subpopulations of macrophage cells and the proteins they secrete alter mesenchymal
cell differentiation in cells from young and old animals. There will be an initial focus on beta-catenin, but an
unbiased approach will be used as well.
 This proposed work builds on our prior studies of rejuvenation by heterochronic parabiosis in fracture
repair. It will address critical gaps in our knowledge about the mechanism responsible for the rejuvenation
phenotype driven by heterochronic parabiosis. Our work will also identify a novel therapeutic approach to
address a critical clinical problem in older patients, delayed fracture healing.","386374",

The normal aortic valve is tricuspid with three leaflets derived from multiple cell lineages during
embryogenesis. Aortic valve patterning is genetically controlled where individual cells in the valve-
forming field refine their fates and functions in response to positional and environmental cues. Genetic
mutations that alter cell-cell and cell-environmental signals can disrupt the developmental process,
leading to anomalous aortic valve, for example, bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). Affecting ~2% of the
general population in US, BAV is the most common congenital heart defect. Fusion of two of three
leaflets or absence of one leaflet during embryogenesis results in various BAV subtypes. After birth,
over half of BAV patients develop calcific aortic valve disease with no effective medicine, while BAV subtypes
have varied cardiac complications, which decide the disease outcome. With the International Bicuspid Aortic
Valve Consortium (BAVCon) being established to identify the genetic causes of BAV in humans, animal models
of BAV are critically needed to elucidate morphogenic and cellular mechanisms of human BAV, as well as
molecular signals that control aortic valve patterning in order to identify therapeutic targets for disease
prevention. To this end, we have generated two mouse models of BAV with distinct signaling defects and
anomalous leaflets. In the first model, knocking out notch receptor 1 (Notch1) in valve endocardial cells (VECs)
recapitulates the most common human BAV subtype – fusion of left and right coronary leaflets, which are mainly
derived from VECs by epithelial to mesenchymal transformation. This model also reveals that the NOTCH1-
TNFa signaling from VECs controls apoptosis of valve mesenchymal cells (VMCs). In the second model, deleting
SRY-box transcription factor 17 (Sox17) in VECs results in a rare but more severe type of BAV – absence of
non-coronary leaflet, of which VMCs arise predominantly from the second heart field (SHF)-derived
cardiomyocytes, and the patterning defect is associated with reduced VEC-VMC PDGFB signaling. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that coordinated VEC-VMC signals control normal aortic valve patterning and
their disruption leads to various BAV subtypes, in the context of the origin and location of affected cells. We will
test this hypothesis in two Aims. Aim 1 is planned to reveal coordinated VEC-VMC signal networks during normal
aortic valve patterning and identify signaling events that are disrupted in various BAV subtypes. Aim 2 is designed
to uncover the functions of PDGF signaling in normal aortic valve patterning as well as use it as an example to
illustrate how a disrupted signaling event can alters cell fate and function, leading to a specific BAV. Successful
accomplishment of these Aims will provide new insights into BAV pathogenesis, with a broad implication in
congenital heart valve disease.","701677",

Gliomas are major primary brain tumors, of which glioblastomas (GBM) are the most common and aggressive
forms. The poor outcome of traditional treatment for these tumors demands targeted therapies based on
identified mechanisms that drive tumor development. Molecular pathology has classified GBM into subtypes,
among which the mesenchymal (MES) group is the most malignant. It is still unclear how GBM MES
differentiation is achieved. Recent anatomically based transcriptome studies found that tumor cells associated
with the necrotic region have higher expression of the MES signature genes, suggesting that the necrotic tumor
microenvironment may contribute to MES differentiation and could be exploited as a therapeutic target. The goal
of this project is to mechanistically and functionally study GBM necrosis, and identify vulnerabilities of GBM MES
progression for therapeutics. We have established the follow premise for the proposed studies. First, we have
developed novel pathologically relevant GBM mouse models showing MES differentiation and extensive necrosis.
Second, we identified ferroptosis as a novel mechanism for GBM necrosis. Third, in both patient GBM samples
and mouse models, we found that the necrotic tumor areas are infiltrated by neutrophils. Our studies suggested
that these tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are necessary and sufficient to induce tumor cell ferroptosis.
Furthermore, we found that ferroptosis and TANs are associated with the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We
hypothesize that GBM necrosis occurs through neutrophil-triggered ferroptosis, and this process is orchestrated
by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We further hypothesize that ferroptosis could promote tumor
progression and be targeted for therapeutic purposes. We propose the following three specific aims: 1) to
determine the mechanism of tumor cell ferroptosis induced by TANs; 2) to determine the role of hypoxic tumor
microenvironment in tumor cell ferroptosis; 3) to demonstrate the role of ferroptosis in GBM progression and
evaluate therapeutic effects of ferroptosis blockade. We will employ a panel of established human GBM cell lines,
newly isolated human GBM cells, and mouse GBM models. GBM necrosis is a diagnostic hallmark, predicts
tumor aggressiveness, and has deleterious effects on treatments. The nature and mechanism of cell death
associated with this necrosis remain obscure. In addition, whether tumor necrosis blockade could benefit
therapies is still unknown. By establishing the GBM models faithfully recapitulating the extent of necrosis
observed in GBM patients and identification of ferroptosis as the underlying mechanism of tumor necrosis, this
proposal will reveal vulnerabilities of GBM MES progression, which could be a novel avenue for GBM
therapeutics.","354108",

plays a causal role in many human occlusive vascular diseases. To better understand key biological events
occurring in human vascular diseases, we analyzed proteomic data from human atherosclerotic plaques and
genomic data associated with human coronary artery disease. This unbiased analysis revealed that many genes
involved in vesicle trafficking/fusion are over-represented. Previous studies have shown that the lipid kinase
PIK3C3 is an essential regulator of vesicle trafficking/fusion. However, its functional role in VSMCs remains
completely unknown. To examine the role of PIK3C3 in VSMCs, we generated inducible SM-specific Pik3c3
knockout (iSM KO) mice driven by Myh11-CreERT2 transgene. Unexpectedly, Pik3c3 iSM KO mice exhibited
lethality 4 weeks after deletion of Pik3c3, due to a pseudo-obstructive intestine resulting from deletion of Pik3c3
in visceral SMCs in addition to VSMCs. The iSM Pik3c3 KO mice also exhibit dramatic remodeling of the vascular
wall including thickening, aneurysmal dilation and spontaneous neointima. Proteomic analysis and bulk RNA-
seq of Pik3c3-deficient aorta revealed loss of contractile proteins while increased expression of inflammation
genes and targets of the Hippo-YAP1 pathway which has been shown to be critical for VSMC development and
phenotypic modulation. Single cell RNA-seq revealed that Pik3c3-deficient aortic VSMCs almost completely lose
their identity of contractile VSMCs while acquiring markers of inflammatory cells and mesenchymal stem cells.
These exciting data suggest a previously undocumented role for PIK3C3 in maintaining SMC identity.
Mechanistically, Pik3c3 inactivation induced YAP1 protein expression and silencing Yap1 largely restored a
contractile phenotype in Pik3c3-deficient VSMCs. We hypothesize that PIK3C3 is a “master” regulator of the
contractile phenotype of VSMC via regulating autophagosome-mediated degradation of YAP1. Three specific
aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. To circumvent the early lethal visceral phenotype seen with Myh11-
CreERT2 transgene, in Aim 1 we will employ a novel vascular-specific inducible Itga8-CreERT2 mouse to generate
VSMC-specific Pik3c3 KO mice. Atherosclerosis will be induced using PCSK9 AAV and the effects of VSM-
specific deletion of Pik3c3 on lesion formation will be evaluated. Wire injury-induced neointimal formation will be
assessed as well by using this novel KO mouse model. Aim 2 will test that YAP1 is a critical mediator conferring
the effects of Pik3c3 deficiency on VSMCs. YAP1 will be pharmacologically and genetically inactivated, and its
effect on vascular remodeling and gene expression will be determined. Aim 3 will test that YAP1 protein
accumulation induced by Pik3c3 deficiency is due to the impaired autophagic flux that attenuates autolysosome-
mediated YAP1 degradation. Proposed studies will determine the role of PIK3C3 in autophagic flux in vivo and
the role of ubiquitin and p62/SQSTM1 in PIK3C3-mediated degradation of YAP1 in human VSMCs in vitro.
Completion of these studies will provide novel insights into the mechanism of controlling VSMC phenotype.","619942",

will be fabricated via a salt-leaching procedure with various design modifications to
promote osteogenesis and neovascularization. PDMS molds will first be used to create
macroscopic channel geometries within the endplates. Endplates will be further modified
via hydroxyapatite deposition, and the incorporation of microspheres containing vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The potential for mesenchymal stem cell osteogenesis
on the hydroxyapatite modified scaffolds will be established in vitro, via the alkaline
phosphatase assay, qPCR analysis of osteogenic genes, and histology. The bioactivity
of the VEGF released from the microsphere containing scaffolds will also be assessed in
vitro using the tube formation assay. Aim 2: Determine the effect of optimized endplate
design on the in vivo integration and nutrition of a whole tissue engineered disc
construct. In this Aim, optimized endplates will be utilized in eDAPS to be implanted in
vivo in the rabbit lumbar spine for 10 or 20 weeks. New bone and vascular formation in
the endplates following in vivo implantation will be assessed via calcein and alizarin
labelling and microFil enhanced µCT, respectively. Small molecule trans-endplate
diffusion into the engineered disc implants will be assessed via post-contrast enhanced
MRI. Integration strength of the eDAPS with the native vertebral bodies will be assessed
via tension, compression and torsional mechanical testing at physiologic loads. Animal
functional rehabilitation following eDAPS implantation will be assessed via activity
monitoring using the Motionwatch-8R, and ground reaction force mapping during
ambulation using a Tekscan system. The proposed work will advance the state-of-the art
in the field of intervertebral disc tissue-engineering, and provide insights that will speed
translation of the eDAPS technology towards clinical use."," ",

The ocular surface is comprised of the cornea, conjunctiva, eyelids and associated glands that are responsible
for secretion of the tear film. Dysgenesis or disruption of the homeostasis of any of these structures can lead to
corneal and ocular surface diseases, which can result in loss of eyesight or cause blindness. Understanding the
genesis of the ocular surface tissues, and its normal function and repair after disease or trauma, is crucial for
identifying disease-associated genes and novel drugs that may lead to innovative therapies that are essential
for maintaining visual health. We request support for the Gordon Research Conference and Seminar of the
Cornea and Ocular Surface Biology, Pathology and Regeneration (GRC-COSBPR), February 13-18, 2022, at
Ventura Beach Marriott in California. The goal of the 2022 GRC-COSBPR is to bring together international
leaders in the field and provide a forum for the most recent, cutting-edge basic, translational and clinical research
focused on expediting translation of findings from bench to bedside. Building on the strong track record from the
past six meetings, we plan 9 scientific sessions on key paradigm shifting innovations in ocular surface biology,
pathology, and tissue repair. The session titles are: 1. Novel Approaches to Data Acquisition and Analysis; 2.
Cellular Interactions, the Extracellular Matrix, and Morphogenesis; 3. Genomics and Gene Regulation; 4.
Advances in Cornea and Ocular Surface Wound Repair; 5. Mechanisms of Ocular Surface Disease and
Disorders; 6. Stem cells of the Ocular Surface; 7. Inflammation and Regeneration of the Ocular Surface; 8.
Sickness and Health of the Cornea and Ocular Surface; 9. Translation of Ocular Surface Research into Novel
Therapies. We are organizing a diverse, gender-balanced meeting with speakers invited from North and Latin
America, United Kingdom, Israel, Asia (Japan, India, China), and Australia. Special emphasis will be given to
increase diversity by inviting women and underrepresented minorities. Each session will be co-moderated by an
early career scientist paired with an established researcher. The sessions will include extended time for
discussions. A portion of each session is uncommitted to select speakers from submitted abstracts, particularly
early career investigators. The GRC conference will include a “Power Hour” to discuss challenges women and
underrepresented minorities face in science and issues of diversity and inclusion. The 2022 GRC will be
preceded by the 5th two-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) led by dedicated students and post-docs. The
GRS provides an opportunity for young scientists to present their research in a non-intimidating environment,
with support and feedback from a few senior scientists. The GRS start of the meeting fosters community building
and long term relationships. The 2022 GRC-COSBPR meeting will be advertised by the GRC and the program
updates will be posted on the website and via social media such as Twitter and Facebook to increase visibility
among junior scientists and trainees. We believe our program is aligned with the scientific goals of NEI and its
support will enable us to provide a high quality and successful meeting.","42000",

 Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and is the leading cause of impaired mobility in
the elderly. More than 67 million people have been forecasted to be affected by OA in the US by 2030,

Significant progress has been made in recent years in osteoarthritis (OA) research, including the generation of
mouse models, including genetic and surgically-induced OA mouse models that show an OA-like phenotype.
One feature that is common to these mouse models of OA is the up-regulation of Runx2. Because Runx2 is a
key transcription factor directly regulating the expression of genes encoding for matrix degradation enzymes,
such as Mmp9, Mmp13 and Adamts5, this up-regulation leads to the increase in expression of these genes.
The key questions have been raised. 1) Is Runx2 a central molecule mediating OA development in joint tissue?
2) Could manipulation of Runx2 expression be used to treat OA disease? miRNAs are endogenous non-
coding RNAs and play important roles in regulation of RNA stability and protein expression. Previous studies
by our lab have shown that miR-204/-211, two homologous miRNAs, bind Runx2 and regulate Runx2
expression in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). To determine the function of these miRNAs in Runx2
regulation and in OA development, we have recently created miR-204 and miR-211 floxed alleles and further
generated miR-204/-211 double KO mice (dmiRPrx1 and dmiRAgc1ER) by breeding miR-204flox/flox and miR-
211flox/flox mice with Prx1-Cre (targeting limb MSCs) or Agc1-CreER (targeting adult articular chondrocytes)
transgenic mice to delete these miRNAs. A severe OA-like phenotype was observed in dmiRPrx1 and
dmiRAgc1ER KO mice and entire knee joint tissues were affected by miR-204/-211 deletion, including severe loss
of articular cartilage, subchondral sclerosis, chondrophyte/osteophyte formation, and synovial hyperplasia.
Our findings suggest that miR-204 and miR-211 are key regulators in maintaining joint tissue homeostasis and
could be served as critical targets for OA treatment. The underlying hypothesis of this project is that miR-
204 and miR-211 are key regulators of Runx2 expression and play critical roles in maintaining joint tissue
homeostasis. Two specific aims have been proposed to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will fully
characterize the longitudinal effects of miR-204/-211 deletion on OA development in dmiRAgc1ER KO mice and
determine if deletion of Runx2 in chondrocytes will reverse OA phenotype observed in dmiRAgc1ER KO mice. In
Aim 2, we will investigate changes in miR-204/-211 expression in OA samples and determine if in vivo
administration of miR-204 will prevent OA development or decelerate OA progression in surgically-induced OA
mouse model. These proposed studies will provide novel insights into mechanisms of OA development and
will help the development of new strategies for OA treatment.","310860",

a systemic inflammatory response. The invading organism(s) activate immune cells of the host, in an effort to
eradicate the infection. However, this pro-inflammatory response often persists, leading to organ dysfunction
and subsequent death. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), and the autophagy process, are key mediators of
the response to sepsis. Autophagy represents a pathway for the turnover of damaged proteins and organelles
(such as mitochondria), which can promote survival under various disease conditions. Genes critical for the
regulation of autophagy include Beclin 1. MSCs are a population of cells, originally isolated from the bone
marrow, that are a promising platform for cell-based therapy. We have shown that MSCs improve survival in
murine sepsis by decreasing organ injury, improving bacterial clearance, interacting with immune cells and
promoting resolution of inflammation. Low-dose CO exposure induces autophagy in vivo, however the impact of
CO conditioning on the autophagy response in MSCs, and its effect on MSC function during sepsis, requires
investigation. We hypothesize that autophagy is a key mediator in regulating the ability of CO (ex vivo) to
enhance MSC function in experimental models of sepsis, both by cell-to-cell and paracrine actions of MSCs. To
test our hypothesis, we propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will decipher the importance of the autophagy
pathway, for enhanced MSC function during sepsis, after CO pre-conditioning of MSCs ex vivo. MSCs will be
harvested from Beclin1+/– and wild-type (WT) mice, or Beclin1 will be silenced (shBeclin1) in WT MSCs, and
then administered to WT mice after cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), an experimental model of sepsis. We will
determine whether the enhanced function of CO pre-conditioning is lost in autophagy protein deficient MSCs.
We will also study the effect of CO on WT and autophagy protein deficient MSCs to promote bacterial
clearance, resolution of inflammation, preservation of organ function, and survival. In Aim 2 we will determine
the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the paracrine actions of MSCs pre-conditioned with CO, and
investigate the importance of autophagy in this response. EVs will be isolated from MSCs derived from WT and
Beclin1+/– mice, or from shBeclin1 MSCs, and given to WT mice after the onset of sepsis. In Aim 3, we will
determine whether ex vivo pre-conditioning of MSCs with CO improves the outcome of autophagy protein
deficient mice during sepsis. WT MSCs pre-conditioned with CO, will be administered to Beclin1+/– mice, and
mice in which autophagy is pharmacologically inhibited, after CLP-induced sepsis. In addition, we will assess
EVs derived from MSCs exposed to CO, on sepsis outcome in autophagy protein deficient mice. If successful,
this application will elucidate mechanisms by which MSCs improve the host response to sepsis. Elucidating the
importance of autophagy in MSCs, and the enhancement of MSC function by CO will also advance our
understanding of MSC biology and optimize their potential therapeutic use.","308548",

understanding is that PTOA is caused by maladaptive repair responses including activation of the pro-
inflammatory pathways of innate immunity that in turn result in pain, loss of function and structural decline. This
project addresses the hypothesis that promotion of hyaline cartilage repair will effectively alter the course of
PTOA, relieve joint pain and improve joint function. Native mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) residing in the joint
are important targets for manipulation to differentiate into chondrocytes. These joint-resident MSCs include
cartilage progenitor cells, MSCs in synovial fluid, synovium and adipose tissue. SOX9 (SRY-type high-mobility
group box gene-9) is the master transcription factor for chondrogenesis of MSCs. We have produced a
superpositively charged SOX9 (scSOX9) which can penetrate into MSCs and induce chondrogenesis. We
have demonstrated in an acute cartilage injury model that scSOX9 induced hyaline-like cartilage repair by
promoting chondrogenesis of bone marrow derived MSCs (BM-MSCs). By using medial meniscal transection
(MMT) induced rat PTOA model, we will test the therapeutic effect of scSOX9 by harnessing the chondrogenic
potential of these joint-resident MSCs for regeneration of hyaline cartilage. Pain and joint function will be
assessed clinically in live animals by measuring behavior changes at different time points of the disease
course. The degree of cartilage regeneration or repair and synovitis will be quantified by advanced imaging
system. At the termination of experiments, the biomechanical property of the repaired cartilage will be
measured on intact cartilage with subchondral bone using biomomentum indentation technology. Cartilage
degradation, repair and synovitis will also be determined by standardized methods of histopathology and
immunohistochemistry."," ",

 Cellular plasticity, a feature associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributes
to tumor cell survival, migration, invasion, and therapy resistance. Across human cancer, tumors that are high
grade, poorly differentiated, and have undergone EMT carry a worse prognosis with a high likelihood of
metastasizing to distant organs. EMT is a common feature associated with tumor progression and is thought
to be critical to cancer cell dissemination in some tumors, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDA). PDA is a lethal and poorly understood human malignancy that is characterized by an activating
mutation in KRAS. Additionally, AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), has been implicated in tumor
progression, metastasis, therapy resistance, and EMT in multiple cancer types including PDA. During my
dissertation studies, I have found that TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a critical downstream effector of
mutant active KRAS, is central to AXL-driven EMT in KRAS-mutant PDA. However, the mechanism of how
TBK1 drives EMT has yet to be elucidated. We hypothesize that TBK1 drives EMT via activation of AKT3
and the stability of downstream transcriptional networks. My data demonstrate that AKT3 is activated
downstream of TBK1 in response to stimulation of AXL, which leads to the binding of AKT3 and Slug in an
AXL-TBK1 dependent manner. To complete my dissertation, I will establish the function of AKT3 in driving EMT
downstream of Axl and TBK1 with the following goals: 1) Establish the necessity of AKT3 for Axl and TBK1 driven
EMT; 2) Evaluate EMT transcription factors engaged downstream of TBK1 and 3) Determine the effect of AKT3
activation on the stability of EMT transcription factors.
 Despite significant evidence that EMT directly contributes to tumor progression, several studies have
suggested EMT is not required for the metastatic spread of PDA and breast cancer. For example, most
metastatic lesions are known to exhibit epithelial features, an observation that seems to be at odds with
EMT as a prerequisite for metastasis. As such, the importance of EMT in cancer biology h as been
questioned. I hypothesize that the chronic activation of an EMT program within a tumor may depend on
paracrine signals within the tumor microenvironment, dictating whether the tumor cells undergo EMT or
MET. Because these cells exist in a plastic state, it is possible that these tumor cells readily revert their
phenotype based on a microenvironment-specific context and factors. Additionally, current in vivo lineage-
tracing technology has not settled the debate between the importance of collective m igration and/or EMT
for metastatic dissemination. During my postdoctoral research, I aim to investigate the role of EMT in
metastasis using in vivo lineage tracing, single-cell sequencing, and organoids to better understand
epithelial plasticity in an oncogene- and tissue-specific manner. Understanding this process will aid in the
development of effective metastatic cancer therapies and will direct future research directions in metastasis.","89813",

Adult stem cells hold broad-ranging clinical potential to regenerate injured tissues. For instance, mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) have been investigated in over 950 clinical trials for use in many disease indications.
Despite their significant clinical relevance, however, there is currently lack of the mechanistic understanding to
precisely control MSC functions for reproducible therapeutic outcomes. Engineered hydrogels have been used
to reveal the ability of MSCs to sense and respond to matrix biophysical cues, which subsequently impact the
differentiation potential of MSCs. However, leveraging these insights for therapeutic purposes has been
challenging, since current approaches to interface a cell population with a hydrogel by uncontrolled mixing
overlook the significance of heterogeneity in the local amount of the gel presented to individual cells, leading to
variable and unclear cell-material interactions at the single cell level. We describe herein a highly efficient
approach to control microscale hydrogel deposition around single cells in a 3D space independently of gel
composition and elasticity. Using this approach, our preliminary data show that MSCs rapidly expand in volume
when they adhere to an integrin ligand in thinner gels. We show that encapsulating single MSCs in a thin gel
coating is sufficient to enhance the osteogenic potential of MSCs even when gel elasticity is low. We will build
upon these results to test the hypothesis that controlling local gel deposition around single MSCs impacts
membrane tension and lineage specification by regulating cell volume expansion. In Aim 1, we will determine
the effect of varying local gel deposition on regulatory volume decrease by modulating mechanosensitive ion
channels and its impact on membrane tension of MSCs. In Aim 2, we will determine how varied local gel
deposition impacts single MSC fate and MSC-based bone regeneration. We predict that there exists a
transcriptional program that is selectively activated when the gel deposition becomes thinner, thereby
impacting lineage specification of MSCs independently of gel elasticity. The project is highly multidisciplinary in
that it will employ a combination of expertise in biomaterials, biophysical, genetic, and in vivo approaches to
address the specific aims. The results will help to define local gel deposition as an important determinant of
stem cell growth, thereby impacting stem cell mechanics and fate. Given the clinical relevance of these cells,
our results will inform formulation design of MSC-based therapeutics for improved regenerative outcomes.","360135",

 Low back pain is the leading cause of disability in the United States, with an estimated socioeconomic cost
exceeding $100 billion each year. Intervertebral disc degeneration, a cascade of cellular, compositional,
structural and compositional changes, is strongly implicated as a cause of low back pain. Current clinical
approaches for treating low back pain associated with disc degeneration have limited long term efficacy as
they seek only to manage symptoms without restoring native disc structure and mechanical function. There is
an overwhelming clinical need for new treatment options, which target not only the symptoms of low
back pain, but also the underlying causes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an attractive option for cell-
based disc regeneration due to their safety, ease of isolation and ability to adopt phenotypes similar to those of
disc nucleus pulposus cells. A major challenge to successful MSC-based disc regeneration, however, is the
local cellular microenvironment, which presents conditions of limited nutrition, low oxygen, low pH, and
persistent inflammation that predispose therapeutic interventions to failure. The objective of this proposal is
to develop a novel biological therapy that maximizes the survival and anabolic potential of therapeutic
stem cells by simultaneously neutralizing the degenerate disc microenvironment via the sustained
delivery of nutrients, anti-inflammatory drugs and buffering agents. To accomplish this goal, we will
leverage our newly established goat model of disc degeneration that mimics clinically relevant
structural, composition and biomechanical characteristics, including tissue-level inflammation, and
novel drug delivery methods to enable controlled and sustained release of biofactors that neutralize
the degenerative microenvironment. In Aim 1 we will leverage our goat model define the in vivo cellular
microenvironment of the disc as a function of degeneration severity, using cutting edge in situ physiological
monitoring and ex vivo biomolecular assays. In Aim 2 we will optimize our novel microcapsule drug delivery
system to neutralize the degenerate disc microenvironment through sustained delivery of glucose, anti-
inflammatory drugs and buffering agents. In Aim 3 we will carry out short and long term in vivo studies to
establish therapeutic efficacy in our goat model, including clinically-relevant pain assessments. At the
conclusion of these studies we will have developed a rapidly translatable therapy that maximizes the
regenerative potential of MSCs in the disc microenvironment, and established long term preclinical
efficacy, thus placing us in a strong position to move towards human clinical trials.","496258",

mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) infected by harmless common cold virus, the respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV) for treatment of lung cancers, which is the number one killer among cancers
worldwide. Despite advances in the treatment and improvement in outcomes, the 5-year survival
rates remain very poor (15% or less) for non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), which constitute
~85% of all lung cancer patients. Such poor survival rates combined with lung cancer
heterogeneity and development of resistance to classical chemo- and radio-therapies, underscore
the need for development of novel non-palliative therapeutic strategies. Though oncolytic
virotherapies have emerged as a potential alternative to traditional chemo- and radio-therapies,
their application to lung cancers remain limited. Also, inability to target oncolytic viruses to tumors
in general remains a critical barrier and particularly for lung cancers remains a major unmet need.
The motivation for the concept of targeted oncolytic viro-cell therapy against lung cancer comes
from two major developments. First, MSCs, a cell-type generally known to have intrinsic tumor
tropic properties, were found to be highly susceptible to RSV, with >90% infection rate, suggesting
the use of RSV-infected MSCs for both tumor targeting and tumor killing. This potential was
challenged by upregulation of indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) by RSV-infected MSCs, which
suppresses tumor immunity and thus aid in tumorigenesis. However, it was found that IDO-
deficient hMSCs remain highly susceptible to RSV while alleviating the tumor suppressive effect.
Second, nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) deficient (ΔNS1) RSV replicates with high viral titer in lung
tumor cells, compared to the normal WI-38 diploid lung cells. Together these findings have led to
the hypothesis that the ∆NS1 RSV-infected IDO-deficient MSCs will retain tumor tropism and
would lend themselves to develop a targeted oncolytic viro-cell therapy against lung cancers. This
hypothesis will be tested in the following three specific aims. !
In aim #1, it is planned to develop and characterize a stable IDO-deficient hMSC cell line using the
CRISPR method and examine the anti-tumor activity potential of wild type and engineered (ΔNS1)
RSV-infected MSCs (RMSCs) in 3D multicell tumoroid cultures in vitro and biopsy-derived
tumoroids ex vivo. In aim #2, it is proposed to assess the anti-cancer potential of RMSCs in vivo in
immunocompetent syngeneic orthotopic model of lung cancer and evaluate their potential to
modulate anti-tumor immunity. In aim #3 the effects of RMSC in modulating apoptosis induced by
viral antigens will be investigated.
Overall, the targeted RMSC therapy is expected to provide a highly innovative and effective
approach for treatment of lung cancers. The PIs are uniquely positioned to conduct the proposed
studies to develop a novel therapeutic approach for lung cancers, which may apply to other
neoplastic diseases. All the required methods, reagents and collaborations are in place for the
successful completion of this proposed program with highest clinical impact in the lung cancer field."," ",

Aberrant epithelial reprogramming can take the form of metaplasia, characterized by the appearance of
mature cell types that are not normally present at the site of injury. In organ fibrosis, this often culminates
in a transformed barrier composed of matrix-laden scars and metaplastic epithelium. A pathognomonic
feature of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the ectopic appearance of KRT5+ basal cells in the
damaged alveolar compartment, the presence of which correlates with disease severity and survival. This
suggests that metaplasia is a clinically relevant feature of lung fibrosis, and understanding this pathologic
form of epithelial plasticity could present potential therapeutic targets. We have previously shown that
hedgehog (Hh)-activated mesenchyme contributes to components of the scar in fibrotic repair. We now
demonstrate that Hh-activated mesenchyme functionally interacts with airway progenitors to promote
metaplastic KRT5 differentiation in the fibrotic lung. Furthermore, we show that a Hh-BMP signaling
circuit in the airway progenitor niche regulates the metaplastic outcome during fibrotic repair. Our central
hypothesis is that mesenchymal Hh activation upregulates BMP antagonists in the progenitor niche,
which drives epithelial metaplasia in both human and mouse lungs, and this Hh-BMP circuit can be
targeted to mitigate and reverse metaplasia in lung fibrosis. Leveraging novel genetic/pharmacologic
tools we have developed, our single and bulk RNAseq bioinformatics capacity, and our access to human
samples, this proposal aims to address how the mesenchymal compartment of the progenitor niche
modifies epithelial plasticity in fibrotic repair, and outlines a potential pre-clinical pipeline to identify
compounds that can target epithelial metaplasia in lung fibrosis.","527883",

Restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS) is a particularly aggressive form of chronic rejection post-lung
transplantation, marked by an extremely poor prognosis (median survival of < 1 year) and little therapeutic
options. Pathogenesis of RAS remains elusive although association with donor specific antibodies and antibody
mediated rejection have been found in human studies. We have recently characterized a murine lung transplant
model which recapitulates the histologic changes of RAS and establishes the requisite role of humoral immune
response in its development. A unique feature noted in the murine RAS lung allograft was the presence of
activated B cells, plasmablasts, and fully differentiated plasma cell (PCs). PCs were also identified in human
RAS lungs suggesting that a rejecting lung serves as an inflammatory local niche for humoral immune responses.
These antibody secreting cells (ASCs) localized along the bronchovascular bundles (BVBs) and sub-pleural
space, lying in close association with expanding mesenchymal cells (MCs). The key role of specialized stromal
cells, via paracrine factors of C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12) and interleukin (IL)-6, in
establishment of a stable survival niche for ASCs is well recognized across a variety of lymphoid and
hematopoietic tissues. We have recently characterized the in situ niche of a subpopulation of lung-resident
mesenchymal cells which expand and contribute to fibroproliferation in a RAS allograft. This
Foxf1+/Gli1+/Scal1+/Col1+ mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) population forms a three dimensional network
along the bronchovascular bundle (BVB-MSCs). Our new preliminary data demonstrates that these cells are the
high CXCL12/IL-6 expressing population, and lie in close apposition to ASCs in the rejecting lung allograft. A
novel mechanism of upregulation of CXCL12 expression in BVB-MSCs by IL-6 transsignaling and downstream
JAK/Stat activation, with recruited monocytes contributing to the soluble IL-6R, was identified. In this proposal
we will investigate an innovative and novel hypothesis of paracrine signaling between this graft-resident
mesenchymal stromal cell population and immune cells and the role of IL-6 transsignaling/CXCL12 axis in
regulating the humoral inflammatory niche in a rejecting lung. The proposed experiments will utilize our ability to
identify and conditionally target the specific BVB-MSC subpopulation, and the novel orthotropic whole lung
transplant model of RAS to elucidate the spatial in vivo niche of APCs, its temporal regulation by CXCl12
expressing BVB-MSCs, and its functional significance in the pathogenesis of RAS (Aim 1). The role of IL-6 and
IL-6 trans-signaling in cellular communication between resident MCs and infiltrating immune cells within this
niche and the pathogenesis of RAS will be determined (Aim 2). The effect of specific drugs targeting humoral
cell responses and IL-6 signaling pathway will be tested in the murine lung allograft model of RAS (Aim 3).
Together these studies will offer novel mechanistic insight into lung allograft failure and provide pre-clinical
information regarding role of therapeutic modalities targeting humoral immune responses in RAS.","701112",

Placental cells come in close contact with maternal blood and uterine tissues yet are able to evade immune recognition during the course of a normal pregnancy. The maternal immune system faces a challenge during pregnancy: to maintain tolerance toward foreign fetal alloantigens while simultaneously staging a response to potential pathogens at the maternal-fetal interface. The mechanisms through which placental cells evade maternal immune recognition are poorly understood, particularly in the context of human pregnancy. The uterine lining, called decidua, is a particularly understudied and important microenvironment, because it is the interface where placental cells called extravillous trophoblast (EVT) come in close contact with maternal immune cells, of which decidual natural killer (dNK) cells are the most abundant. EVT are highly invasive cells which are required for proper remodeling of the maternal uterine lining, including vascular remodeling which leads to establishment of maternal blood flow to the placenta. Interactions between placental EVT and decidual leukocytes are known to facilitate maternal vascular remodeling by EVT and limit the extent of EVT invasion into the uterine wall. Indeed, problems in preterm birth could result from inappropriate responses by dNK cells. Unfortunately, interactions between dNK and trophoblasts are difficult to study in an ongoing pregnancy, due to lack of access to the decidual compartment, where these important interactions occur. While animal models have offered some insights into these processes, they do not accurately model human placentation and pregnancy. This proposal aims to evaluate the decidual cell population in both term and preterm birth in a systematic, detailed manner, then to combine this knowledge with the latest technologies in regenerative medicine in order to develop in vitro models for the study of dNK-EVT interactions. Over the past few years, our collaborative team of investigators has established optimized methods for differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into both NK cells and EVT. We now propose to generate matched maternal and placental induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and differentiate these cells into dNK cells and EVT, respectively, in order to model interactions between these two cell types. Successful completion of this proposal will establish a reproducible and manipulatable model system for studying interactions between the placenta and maternal immune system and has the potential to lead to identification of mechanisms through which abnormalities in these interactions increase the risk of idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth.","453910",

pathways that can be exploited as therapeutic targets.","NHLBI","10311532","12/20/2021 12:00:00 AM","PA-19-056","5R01HL141853-03","5","R01","HL","141853","03"," ","HASAN, AHMED A K","1/15/2020 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2023 12:00:00 AM","Vascular Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section[VCMB]"," ","9661282","CHEN, HONG ","WANG, DA-ZHI ","07","Unavailable","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","US","42.340629","-71.094923","1504801","BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021155724","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2022 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2022 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2022"," "," ","NHLBI","426599","328481"," ","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial
disease. This progressive vascular disease remains a leading cause of mortality in the United States despite
wide-spread use of effective lipid-lowering therapies and prevention programs. While endothelial cell activation
and neointimal hyperplasia is a hallmark of the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, identification of
molecular markers of dysfunctional endothelium represents a biological challenge as well as an opportunity to
develop new therapeutic targets. In this application, we posit to explore the function of endothelial expressed
CD45 in atherosclerosis. CD45 is best known as marker of hematopoietic cells. Our recent data shows that
CD45 is indispensable in driving the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) following myocardial
infarction. It is thought that EndMT represents a novel endothelial perturbation and a critical regulator of
atherogenesis given that EndMT disrupts the normal function of endothelium by delaminating endothelial cells
and giving rise to neointimal mesenchymal cells, which secrete proinflammatory molecules and extracellular
matrix proteins that fuel atherosclerosis progression. Whether endothelial CD45 contributes to progression of
atherosclerosis by facilitating the EndMT is a completely unknown but highly significant question. In our latest
studies, we showed CD45 null mice injected with the atherosclerosis accelerator PCSK9 AAv8 and fed a
western diet had a marked reduction in atherogenesis. Conversely, we observed a significant increase in CD45
positive endothelial cells (ECs) that undergo the EndMT in atherosclerotic lesions. We also found that
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated activation of CD45 in human ECs induces the EndMT. Intriguingly, CD45 expression
is dramatically increased in HDAC2 knockout hemogenic endothelium, suggesting loss of HDAC2-mediated
repression of CD45 during EndMT. Further, CD45 expression is altered in miR-155 deficient mice, indicating
microRNAs may regulate the expression and function of CD45 during EndMT. Our pilot RNA seq study shows
upregulation of epsins and downregulation of KLFs upon CD45 overexpression. Given that epsins promote and
KLFs impede atherosclerosis, whether CD45 induces EndMT and promotes atherosclerosis by modulating
epsin and KLF function is an entirely novel question. To test this, we will determine the role of endothelial
CD45 in regulating atherosclerosis in vivo and interrogate molecular mechanisms 1) by which endothelial
CD45 regulates EndMT in atherosclerosis by controlling epsin and KLF expression and 2) underlying how
CD45 expression is epigenetically regulated in ECs during EndMT and whether targeting endothelial CD45
promotes atheroma resolution. Our preliminary data presents robust evidence that serves as a strong scientific
premise for our proposed study. If successful, our study will not only provide extensive mechanistic evidence
for a central role of CD45-mediated signaling in regulating the EndMT, but will provide an innovative approach
for the treatment of atherosclerosis and launch a paradigm shift in research to combat cardiovascular disease.","755080",

There is a type of fat called “beige” fat that has the capacity to burn calories and secrete hormones that improve metabolism. Individuals who have more “beige” fat are protected from developing diabetes and heart disease. The genes responsible for making this type of fat are not known, but our studies find that a one of them is a special gene that doesn’t code for a protein. This gene, called LINC00473, may be an organizer of proteins that help burn fat in the mitochondria. We believe that understanding the function of this gene can help us understand how beige fat forms, and how it functions to improve metabolism. It may also help us recapitulate the beneficial effects if

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, and the 5-year survival rate of
all lung cancer patients combined is only about 18%. The implementation of cancer immunotherapeutics for solid
tumors such as lung cancers has shown great promise and provided the possibility for improved outcome in a
small percentage of patients. However, the majority of patients show little to no response or acquire resistance
during treatment with checkpoint inhibitors delivered as a monotherapy. Therefore, identifying resistance
mechanisms and potential combination therapy approaches is a critical need to improve response rates to
immune checkpoint inhibitors and patient prognosis. To address this, a clinically relevant in vivo shRNA dropout
screen focused on genes encoding for FDA-approved drug targets (FDAome) was performed in epithelial and
mesenchymal Kras/p53 (KP) mutant murine lung cancer cells. Mice were then treated with either isotype or anti-
PD-1 antibody. Sequencing for the barcoded shRNAs revealed that Ntrk1 was significantly depleted from
mesenchymal tumors challenged with PD-1 blockade compared to isotype treated tumors, suggesting it provides
a survival advantage to these tumor cells when under immune system pressure. Preliminary data confirmed
Ntrk1 transcript levels are upregulated in mesenchymal tumors treated with PD-1 inhibitors and cell lines derived
from resistant tumors, and analysis of human NSCLC cell lines revealed that Ntrk1 mRNA levels correlate with
a more aggressive, mesenchymal cell phenotype. Additionally, Ntrk1 overexpressing cells upregulate PD-L1
expression when co-cultured with splenocytes through upregulation of JAK signaling. Stable knockdown of Ntrk1
in mesenchymal murine KP mutant lung cancer cells reduced tumor growth in vivo and analysis of tumor-
infiltrating T cell populations via flow cytometry showed that CD8+ T cell exhaustion was significantly reduced,
whereas overexpression of Ntrk1 promoted CD8+ T cell exhaustion, thus decreasing effector status. These
tumors also have an altered microenvironment, with upregulation of classically immunosuppressive cytokines
such as IL-10. PD-1 protein levels were also significantly increased in Ntrk1-high human NSCLC cell lines,
providing additional evidence that Ntrk1 may be a modulator of immune system functionality in human lung
disease. The central hypothesis of the proposed work is that Ntrk1 upregulation causes acquired resistance to
PD-1 blockade via aberrant JAK signaling and downstream CD8+ T cell dysfunction, thereby promoting tumor
cell survival. A variety of powerful tools will be utilized to test this hypothesis, including time-lapse imaging of
dynamic T cell-tumor cell interactions, genetically-engineered and syngeneic preclinical models of lung cancer
to analyze immune subpopulations as a function of Ntrk1 expression, and IHC analyses of human NSCLC tissue
samples. The goal of the proposed work is to provide strong evidence for a rational drug combination of Ntrk1
inhibitors with PD-1 blockade to be carried forward into the clinic to abrogate immune checkpoint blockade
resistance and ultimately improve patient outcomes.","75330",

Congenital birth defects affect an estimated 3% of live births. To develop effective treatment strategies, a
thorough understanding of early human development is necessary. Our lab recently developed and in vitro
model of human gastrulation, the process by which the three germ layers (endoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm)
are formed around week three of gestation. This so-called “gastruloid” model is formed by treating human
embryonic stem cells with purified differentiation factors that cause them to self-organize into a pattern
resembling a gastrulating embryo. One of the key events during this process is formation of the primitive
streak—a migration of specialized mesenchymal stem cells along the embryonic midline that will form all
mesodermal tissues including the heart, lungs, blood vessels, and cells of the circulatory system. At the same
time, cells on the periphery of the embryo begin forming extraembryonic mesoderm, which will ultimately
become placental tissue. Despite the critical importance of these cell fate changes, it is currently unclear which
population of embryonic stem cells will differentiate to form primitive streak or extraembryonic mesoderm and
how these cell fate decisions are determined. The research objective of this fellowship proposal is to
understand when and how human stem cells differentiate into primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm
during gastrulation. My overall approach is to use time-lapse fluorescence imaging to monitor differentiation
decisions in real time and at single-cell solution. I will then employ a specialized type of machine learning
known as deep learning to accurately track the movement and signaling behavior of individual cells. Next, I will
develop a computational model that uses a cell’s image patterns to accurately predict how each cell “chooses”
between differentiation fates. The two specific research aims are: 1) to identify the subpopulation of human
embryonic stem cells that will commit to primitive streak; and 2) to determine the combination of intracellular
and extracellular signaling events that govern differentiation to extraembryonic mesoderm. The proposed work
includes novel experimental procedures (specifically, real-time imaging of gastruloids formation in Aim 1) as
well as unique neural network architectures that accurately predict binary cell fate outcomes of individual stem
cells based on their signaling history. These methods will be generalizable to other biological systems. The
proposed training plan focuses on generating and applying cutting-edge statistical methods tasked with full
single-cell feature data incorporation in order to make robust, theoretically and biologically sound predictions
about human stem cell fate decisions. A better understanding of early human development will inform future
cellular therapies to prevent and treat congenital birth defects. To support my training, I have assembled a
strong mentorship team with expertise in stem cell biology, live-cell imaging, machine learning methodologies,
and causal inference.","37550",

Aortic valve disease is an increasingly prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality, with no current effective
pharmacological treatment. An underlying pathology is often aberrant differentiation of valvular interstitial cells
(VICs) leading to altered composition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and calcification. Although various factors
involved in VIC differentiation have been described, the chromatin modifiers required to maintain mesenchymal
identity of VICs remain largely unknown. Histone deacetylases (Hdacs) lack intrinsic DNA-binding domains but
modify chromatin via their interactions with transcription factors, co-factors, and large multiprotein transcriptional
complexes. We recently published that mouse embryos lacking Hdac3 within the second heart field cardiac
progenitor cells exhibit complete embryonic lethality and severe cardiac developmental defects, including
bicuspid and hyperplastic aortic valve. Our preliminary data suggest a novel and unexpected role of Hdac3 in
postnatal aortic valve homeostasis. Hdac3-null aortic valves exhibit upregulation of a discrete set of
chondrogenic genes, which are frequently elevated in human diseased aortic valves. In murine aortic valves,
Hdac3 recruits components of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), including methyltransferase Ezh2,
Eed, and Suz12 to enrich trimethylation of lys27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3), a gene silencing mark, at the
regulatory chondrogenic gene loci. The goal of this research program is to identify how Hdac3 regulates
mesenchymal identity of aortic valvular interstitial cells in both humans and mice. In addition, proposed studies
will identify the mechanisms by which different kinases involved in signaling pathways regulate the
phosphorylation, function, and chromatin recruitment of Hdac3. Despite intense study in the area of epigenetics,
very little is known about the role of epigenetic and chromatin modifiers in the field of aortic valve biology. The
set of experiments outlined in this proposal have broad significance not only for understanding how signaling
pathways intersect with chromatin modifiers to regulate homeostasis of aortic valves, but also could be highly
applicable to the entire field of cardiovascular diseases.","376875",

Atherosclerosis, the major cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), is a chronic disease characterized by lipid
retention and vascular inflammation. Endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and macrophages
are recognized to have a unique impact on the disease progression. It is recently recognized that specific
dysregulation of metabolic signaling pathways contributes to certain aspects of EC, macrophage and SMC
homeostasis. For instance, during the process of atherosclerosis, ECs are exposed to a pro-inflammatory
milieu that enhances glycolysis and reduces fatty acid oxidation in ECs and predisposes them to undergo
mesenchymal transition (EndMT), which may affect plaque stability. The implications of non-coding RNAs,
including microRNAs (miRNAs), in cardiovascular disease is well recognized, representing the most rapidly
evolving research field. Furthermore, miRNAs have emerged as critical regulators of cellular metabolism (e.g.
miR-33) and therefore can directly regulate EC metabolic responses that can determine the progression of
atherosclerosis, although this aspect has not been elucidated yet. Moreover, miRNAs can promote the
acquisition of mesenchymal markers (e.g. miR-21) that can in turn shape their metabolic response and
mesenchymal phenotype, thus affecting EC atherosclerotic phenotype. This has also not been investigated
in detail. In this regard, similar mechanisms may be involved in the phenotypic regulation of SMC during
atherosclerosis, and need to be explored as well. A vast literature has demonstrated that miRNAs play
important roles in macrophage functions by regulating macrophage inflammatory responses and
lipid metabolism. Increasing evidence indicates that a substantial crosstalk exists between innate immune
signaling and metabolic pathways. Macrophage activation and differentiation prominently feature the
modulation of genes involved in general cellular metabolic activities. In this regard, downregulation of
cholesterol biosynthetic genes in classically activated macrophages is linked to regulation of inflammatory
reactions elicited by macrophages. A critical outstanding question is how the dynamic interplay between
cholesterol, cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates and cholesterol derivatives influences macrophage foam
cell formation and inflammation, which are key determinants of atherosclerosis progression. On the whole,
this research program aims to elucidate different mechanisms that regulate cell-specific metabolic signaling

Epithelial cells employ components of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program as the main route

Aggressive tumors that are metastatic and intrinsically resistant to conventional therapies represent a critical
issue mediating the morbidity and mortality of most, if not all tumors, including breast cancer. It is postulated
that targeting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the ensuing formation of cancer stem cells
(CSCs) is likely to represent a means of reducing the rate at which primary breast cancers spawn metastatic
derivatives. In the context of cancer, cells having undergone an EMT have enhanced tumor-initiating ability,
are capable of generating mammospheres, exhibit cell-surface markers and gene expression profiles similar
to both normal mammary (MaSC) and breast cancer (BCSC) stem cells and become more resistant to
chemotherapeutics. We have recently demonstrated a role for TGFβ-induced EMT in the formation of tumor
initiating cells (TICs), through a signaling pathway involving the RNA binding protein hnRNP E1 (E1). Herein,
our data demonstrates that this TGFβ/E1/ signaling pathway leads to the induction of an embryonic lncRNA
known as Platr18 (pluripotent associated transcript 18). We show that this lncRNA is not expressed in normal
epithelium or other adult somatic tissues but is highly induced by the TGFβ/E1 axis and in cells having
undergone an EMT or during cancer progression. The scientific premise of the proposal is that the TGFβ-
mediated EMT program induces the generation of TICs and tumor progression through TGFβ/E1 signaling and
reactivation of silenced Platr18. Its goals are to delineate the molecular mechanism(s) of Platr18 function and
determine its role in modulating T-cell mediated immunity through VSIG-3 & tumor innervation through

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) generate all blood lineages throughout the life of an organism and are clinically
important as the therapeutic agents of bone marrow transplants used to treat hematological disorders. However,
the availability of transplant therapy is limited by difficulty in finding immunologically compatible donors. The
ability to generate large numbers of autologous HSCs in vitro from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a
major biomedical objective and has the potential to eliminate problems of cell availability. To date, it has not
been possible to generate bona fide HSCs with high engraftment potential and multi-lineage reconstitution. One
possible means of generating HSCs from iPSCs would be to reconstitute the full set of HSC specification signals
in vitro, however identifying these signals requires further interrogation of the molecular mechanisms controlling
HSC specification in vivo. In vertebrate embryos, HSCs arise from hemogenic endothelium (HE) lining the ventral
floor of the embryonic dorsal aorta (DA). My work using the zebrafish model of developmental hematopoiesis
has shown that trunk neural crest (NC) cells provide required inductive cues for HSC specification to the HE. To
identify novel NC derived regulators of HSC specification with the goal of informing efforts to generate HSCs in
vitro, I conducted a transcriptional profiling screen of trunk NC and endothelial cells. Using NC specific targeted
deletion of genes in zebrafish embryos, I will determine the molecular mechanisms by which candidates identified
in the screen instruct HSC specification. Additionally, I have identified the HE expressed G-protein coupled
receptor Gpr182 and putative co-receptor Ramp2, as novel regulators of HSC specification. Importantly,
knockdown of either gpr182 or ramp2 directly phenocopy the effect of NC ablation on HSC specification,
suggesting that Gpr182 could mediating a NC derived HSC specification signal. Using targeted knock out and
proteomics, I will characterize Gpr182 and Ramp2 in the control of HSC specification. Derivatives of trunk NC,
specifically sympathetic neurons and mesenchymal stem cells, control mobilization of adult HSCs. The
requirement for NC derivatives in HSC specification suggests a lifelong signaling relationship between these cell
types. I will employ permanent lineage tracing approaches to determine if HSC specification and the control adult
HSC mobilization require the same types of NC derivatives. The mentored phase of this proposal will occur at
St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, under Dr. Wilson Clements and will confirm candidate regulators of HSC
specification and focus on generation of mutant/transgenic zebrafish lines for the independent phase. The
independent phase will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which novel regulators instruct HSC specification
and on permanent lineage tracing of NC derivatives. The institutional resources and academic environment and
the planned courses outlined in my proposal will ensure my successful transition to independence.","224099",

PPARγ is the master regulator of adipocyte biology and also plays crucial roles in regulating lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, inflammation, and other responses. It represents a key target for insulin sensitization. The PI has discovered that deacetylation of PPARγ on lysine K268 and K293 promotes the transformation of energy-storing white adipocytes into energy-dissipating brown-like adipocytes, a process called “browning” or “beiging”. To establish the physiological significance of PPARγ deacetylation, the PI generated deacetylation-mimetic PPARγ K268R/K293R mutant knock-in mice (2KR). As reported in the preliminary data, 2KR mice have increased energy expenditure and are protected from obesity, particularly visceral obesity. Strikingly, when 2KR mice are treated with thiazolidinediones (TZDs), they show a robust insulin-sensitizing response but fail to develop the cardiac and bone loss effects that have limited the clinical utilization of TZD. In this application, he proposes to define the mechanisms underlying the two most compelling effects of PPARγ deacetylation, increased beiging, and prevention of TZD-induced bone loss. In Aim 1, he will determine whether PPARγ deacetylation affects adipocyte beiging in an adipocyte cell-autonomous fashion by ex vivo adipocyte differentiation studies. Next, he will dissect the fat-specific functions of 2KR by employing an adipocyte conditional knock-in model. In Aim 2, using the prototypical white adipocyte gene Adipsin as a target, he will employ ChIP, reporter, and promoter pull-down assays to identify acetylation-responsive co-repressor that mediate the effects of 2KR. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, the PI shows that they identified transcription factor Osr1 as an acetylation-dependent PPARγ cofactor. He will test whether the 2KR mutant represses the white adipose program by preventing Osr1-mediated Adipsin expression. In Aim 3, the PI hypothesizes that the 2KR mutant regulates bone turnover by repressing Adipsin. He will first establish the role of Adipsin in osteogenesis and bone remodeling using ex vivo differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal progenitor cells and Adipsin knockout mice. Next, he will determine whether repression of Adipsin is the mechanism by which the 2KR mutant is protected against TZD-induced bone loss using Adipsin gain- or loss-of-function studies in 2KR mice. The proposed studies will advance the field by elucidating the selective regulation of PPARγ through deacetylation and provide mechanistic insight to dissociate the insulin-sensitizing function of PPARγ activation from its adverse effects.","360000",

An attractive modality for bone and soft tissue regeneration involves the use of pluripotent mesenchymal stem
cells that are induced by osteogenic and dermogenic cues. Furthermore, the delivery of engineered cells within
3D-printed, “smart” scaffolds tailored to any shape would make an ideal approach to rapidly repair battlefield
injuries. Our overall goal is to investigate capacity of BMP-9-induced, Notch pathway-synergized human adult-
derived urine stem cells seeded onto unique, polydiocitrate-graphene hybrid scaffolds, to heal critical-sized multi-
tissue defects in the rat scalp/cranium. This project is based on the hypothesis that the combination of BMP-9-
Notch-induced stem cell osteogenesis and a three-dimensional scaffold capable of hosting stem cell
differentiation along osteogenic and dermogenic lineages will lead to adequate reconstruction of critical-sized
multi-tissue craniofacial defects. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: 1) To
investigate the mechanisms by which BMP9 induced human urine progenitor stem cells (HUPs) repair trauma-
induced cranial defects in vivo; 2) To develop structural composite scaffolds that can be customized to fit and
regenerate a critical-sized skin and bone calvarial defect in a rodent model. These specific aims will be addressed
by the following experimental design: 1) Treatment of critical-sized rat cranial defects with iHUPs transduced
with BMP9 and abrogation of defect healing with Notch inhibition and; 2) Design and incorporation of 3D-printable
mPOC-graphene/A5G81-PPCN hybrid scaffolds using micro-CLIP technology and testing of scaffold

homeostasis. How hematopoietic cell production is regulated to control the size of the peripheral hematopoietic
cell compartment is not understood. During systemic infection and/or inflammation, lymphoid production is
halted while myelopoiesis is increased, a process that is known as emergency myelopoiesis. How systemic
inflammatory signals alter the BM microenvironment to enable dramatic and quick hematopoietic shifts is also
largely unknown. We propose to address these fundamental questions by studying B cell development under
homeostasis and during systemic inflammation. Studies over the past 6 years identified Leptin receptor-
expressing mesenchymal progenitor cells (Lepr+ MPCs) as the major cells producing SCF, IL-7, and the
chemokine CXCL12, that are critical for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and hematopoietic precursor
commitment into the lymphoid lineage. This type of niche organization suggests that cross-talk between
hematopoietic cells and Lepr+ MPCs occurs in vivo, but so far no specific signals delivered by hematopoietic
cells to Lepr+ MPCs have been identified. In this grant we provide evidence showing that Lepr+ MPCs express
Lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTbR) and that LTbR signaling downregulates IL-7 production. Mature B cells that
naturally recirculate through BM express the LTbR ligand LTa1b2. Furthermore, while normal B cell
progenitors express little LTa1b2, pre-leukemic preB cells significantly up-regulate LTa1b2 and reduce IL-7
produced by Lepr+ MPCs in vivo. In aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that LTbR signaling in Lepr+ MPCs
regulates the quality and size of the B cell compartment. Our preliminary findings also revealed that Lepr+
MPCs significantly reduce IL-7 expression during systemic inflammation in a LTbR-dependent manner.
Importantly, when Lepr+ MPCs cannot shut-down IL-7 production, B lymphocytes continue to be made, and
myeloid cell production is significantly reduced. Remarkably, survival against a high dose of Listeria
monocytogenes infection is critically dependent on LTbR signaling. Through experiments described in Aim 2
we will test the hypothesis that LTbR signaling in Lepr+ MPCs is the major molecular pathway controlling
emergency myelopoiesis. Finally, as CXCL12 production is quickly reduced during systemic inflammation,
most hematopoietic cells are rapidly mobilized from BM into the periphery, with the notable exception of mature
B cells that double in number in BM in the early hours after inflammation. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis
that mature B cells play a novel and unsuspected role in innate immunity through BM homing and interaction
with Lepr+ MPCs for delivery of “instructive” LTbR signaling in these cells. We also propose to study the
mechanism(s) used by mature B cells to home and be temporarily retained in BM during systemic
inflammation. The proposed aims will provide a broad conceptual and mechanistic framework for
understanding how bone marrow stromal cells influence cell lineage decisions.","530667",

This is in part through their production of energy-rich nutrients and metabolic intermediates that the cancer cells
“parasitize” from the extracellular fluid to fuel tumor growth and progression. These observations suggest that a
FAP-targeted therapy could provide an AR-independent multi-faceted anti-tumor assault by simultaneously
disrupting the parasitic dependence on the tumor stroma and eliminating multiple immunosuppressive cell types
within the tumor microenvironment (TME). To accomplish this goal, we have synthesized an orally-available
small molecule FAP-activated mitochondrial protoxin based on niclosamide, an FDA-approved anti-helminthic
that uncouples mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation with nanomolar potency in a cell cycle-independent
manner, making it an ideal warhead for FAP+ stromal cells with a low proliferative index.
 This proposal is innovative from conceptual and technical perspectives: 1) multiple tumor-infiltrating FAP+
cells in the TME are selectively and simultaneously targeted to overcome the immune barrier and disrupt the
“parasitic cycle” fueling tumor growth; 2) a first-in-class enzymatically-activated lipophilic mitochondrial protoxin
designed to increase the therapeutic index of an FDA-approved drug while sparing toxicity to surrounding healthy
tissue is synthesized and characterized; 3) FAP expression patterns in a unique series of human prostate tissues,
lymph nodes, and metastases as a function of malignancy and treatment status are assessed to identify clinical
states most likely to benefit from FAP-targeted therapy; and 4) efficacy, toxicity, and specificity are evaluated
using a novel series of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and syngeneic models that recapitulate key clinical
features of human PCa in order to delineate biologically-relevant immune-independent and –dependent
mechanisms underlying the anti-tumor response. Furthermore, this strategy combines agents that have been
individually tested in patients, which significantly bolsters potential for near-term patient benefit. More
immediately, the proposal will provide important insights into the role of FAP+ cells in PCa pathophysiology
particularly with respect to their interaction with the immune system, while providing the necessary preclinical
proof-of-principle data needed to translate this innovative therapeutic platform into the clinic.","373639",

This competitive renewal is based on work demonstrating that a subpopulation of endothelial cells (ECs) in
atherosclerotic plaques undergo a transition to a mesenchymal cell fate that involves loss of barrier function,
expression of inflammatory genes and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. This transition is initiated by
inflammatory signaling that sensitizes cells to TGFβ, which then drives the mesenchymal fate transition. A key
consequence of the mesenchymal phenotype is production of a fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix that amplifies
inflammatory signaling, recruiting leukocytes and production of cytokines. This sequence of events thus creates
positive feedback, a key feature of disease progression and resistance to therapy. Our work during the past grant
cycle has provided evidence that fate switching is driven by a minor subset of pre-existing, susceptible ECs that
drive vessel wall remodeling. Our work has also elucidated novel pathways by which matrix remodeling alters
integrin signaling to enhance inflammatory pathways and promotes disease progression. The overall goal of the
current application is to understand the EC subpopulations and factors that drive fate switching, and the positive
feedback mechanisms that drive disease. Aim 1 will elucidate endothelial heterogeneity in mice and in patients
with atherosclerosis. Aim 2 will characterize disease-prone subset of normal endothelial cells. Aim 3 will
elucidate the role of pro-inflammatory integrin signaling in evolution of EC populations in the atherosclerotic
plaque and the downstream pathways that mediate plaque progression.","752040",

the only lasting effects of combat for these Veterans as over 60% receive antidepressants for a wide range of
depressive and depressive-associated disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Studies
suggest that the major prescribed class of antidepressant, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), is
related to poor bone health. Thus, both non-union and fractures occurring while on SSRIs reflect complicated
fractures that would clinically benefit from new methods to enhance healing. Our data show that the

Blast
injuries via improvised explosive devices account for over 75% of combat casualties, with survivors
experiencing severe orthopedic injuries. These types of orthopedic injuries often result in delayed or non-union,
wherein normal bone healing is impaired. Current interventions for non-union fractures, particularly atrophic
non-union fractures are rarely successful. OIF/OEF/OND Veterans are also at a high risk for depressive and
depressive-associated disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), resulting in >60% of this
population being prescribed antidepressants, specifically selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). While
the effects of SSRIs on fracture healing are unknown, it has been shown that Sertraline (Zoloft) and Paroxetine
(Paxil), first-line SSRIs for pharmacological treatment of these disorders, negatively affect bone health. Given
the prevalence of complex orthopedic injuries, the long-term complications from these injuries, and the
commonness of SSRI use in the OIF/OEF/OND Veteran population, there is a need for new therapies (e.g.,
cell-based therapies) that may overcome current clinical limitations for complicated fractures.
 Our studies using a unique clonal cell transplantation model in conjunction with murine fracture models has
identified the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) as a novel progenitor for osteoblasts, osteocytes, and
chondrocytes during fracture repair. Recent studies show HSC-derived osteoprogenitors directly give rise to
bone in vivo. These findings are paradigm shifting in that most studies focus on the use of mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs) for musculoskeletal injury repair and suggest a benefit of HSC-based therapies for complicated
fracture. Building on our previous MERIT studies, which demonstrated a role for bone morphogenetic protein-2
(BMP-2), BMP-9, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-2) in promoting osteogenesis from the HSC, we have now
shown a combination of IGF-2+BMP-9 results in enhanced osteoinduction from HSC-osteogenic precursors.
We have also identified HSC-derived circulating osteogenic progenitors (COPs) that increase in blood during
normal fracture repair and are mobilized with AMD3100 delivery, suggesting a potential therapeutic modality.
Our preliminary data also demonstrate that SSRI administration in vivo leads to impaired bone healing, results
in altered osteogenic profiles during healing, and inhibits osteoinduction from HSC-progenitors in vitro.
 We hypothesize that HSC-derived osteo-chondrogenic progenitor cells may be targeted to enhance repair
of complicated fractures. Our goals are to examine the ability of HSC-derived osteo-chondrogenic progenitors
(compared to MSCs) to serve as a therapeutic modality during complicated non-union fractures and fractures
during SSRI administration, uncover the mechanisms by which these cells may have a beneficial effect, and
elucidate the effects of SSRIs on this unique population of progenitor cells. Specific Aims are to determine 1)
if modulation of HSC-derived osteo-chondrogenic precursors in vivo promotes healing in a model of atrophic
non-union and 2) if SSRIs impair fracture healing via inhibition of HSC-derived osteogenic precursors.
 These studies are significant in that they challenge existing dogma by suggesting a novel HSC origin for
bone cells and innovative in that they will determine the potential of exploiting HSCs to enhance healing in
cases of complicated fracture. Findings from this study are easily translated to clinic (HSC mobilization is FDA
approved for other applications) and have the potential to directly impact Veteran Health Care. Understanding
how SSRIs affect bone healing and specific stem cell compartments may have tremendous clinical impact
given the large number of injured Veterans prescribed SSRIs. This work will have far-reaching benefit for
military personnel and Veterans at high risk for complicated fracture, specifically those of OIF/OEF/OND being
treated for clinical depression and/or PTSD using an SSRI, and thus, is highly relevant to the VA Mission."," ",

osseointegration and earlier loading times for implants in bone that has been compromised by trauma or

improve quality of life in comparison to removable dentures, but many denture patients experience
considerable bone loss, risking exposing the mandibular nerve during surgery and limiting implant placement.
The aging population has an increased need for technologies that provide predictable implant osseointegration
in orthopaedic sites (e.g. spine). Medical treatment for metabolic bone diseases like osteoporosis improve
implant success, but many patients are not treated with these drugs. Osteoinductive agents like BMPs can
improve clinical outcomes, but these technologies are expensive, can have negative side effects, and for some
applications are contra-indicated. Our goal is to exploit the physical surface properties of dental and
orthopaedic implants to generate new bone in patients lacking sufficient supporting bone without relying on
pharmacologic interventions. Our work has shown that the microscale and nanoscale properties of 2D titanium
(Ti) and Ti-alloy surfaces are sufficient to drive osteoblast differentiation of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) in vitro and increase the rate of new bone formation in vivo in animals and patients, improving
osseointegration and implant stability. Additive manufacturing (AM) makes it possible to design-patient specific

difficult to achieve. To overcome this technology limitation, we will develop our novel magnesio(calcio)thermic

derived Ti-6Al-4V implants. We will: (1) Determine the mechanism(s) of the M(C)T process controlling the
surface nanostructure and use this understanding to tailor nanoscale surface features for enhanced osteoblast
differentiation on AM-derived 3D implants; (2) Determine the mechanisms that mediate the differential effects
of surface design features on planar cell polarity and MSC commitment to an osteoblast lineage fate (i.e.,
obligatory change in shape from flattened MSCs, which can migrate, adhere to the implant, and proliferate, to
columnar secretory osteoblasts, which synthesize and mineralize bone matrix); and (3) Assess how changes in
surface design impact bone formation and remodeling in vitro by understanding how MSCs modulate
osteoclast activity and in vivo using aged male and female rats to assess any sex differences, estrogen-
deficient rats as a model of compromised bone health, and rabbit femurs as a model of function under load-
bearing conditions. Our studies take advantage of the investigative team's skills in cell and molecular biology,
experimental pathology, material science, non-destructive testing and mechanical engineering.","566721",

 Pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease caused by inactivating mutations in the
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2) gene which results in constitutive activation of the mechanistic target
of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. LAM manifests with diffuse parenchymal cysts complicated by secondary
spontaneous pneumothorax, chylous pleural effusions and renal angiomyolipoma. In addition, a subset of LAM
patients also develops pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. More recently, mTOR has
been implicated in other proliferative pulmonary diseases including chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD),
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Despite the growing importance
of mTOR activation in pulmonary diseases, the effects of mTOR hyperactivation on pulmonary cells remains
incompletely understood.
 To study the effects of mTOR activation on pulmonary vascular remodeling, I will utilize a novel mouse
model with tsc2 deletion as well as single cell RNA sequencing of human LAM lungs. I have found pulmonary
vascular remodeling in the tsc2-null mice that mirrors histopathological findings in human LAM. Moreover, our
lab recently found that LAM cells hijack the lung transcriptome leading to WNT pathway upregulation in the LAM
lung. This proposal will examine how WNT activation in mTOR hyperactivated lungs contributes to pulmonary
vascular remodeling with transgenic mice created by the cross of our novel tsc2-null (mTOR activated) mouse
with Ctnnb1 (β-catenin) WNT pathway-activated mouse lines.
 This project will expand my training to include key methods and concepts in cellular crosstalk and signaling.
My training will comprise of individualized mentorship, coursework/workshops in flow cytometry, training in
bioinformatics and animal models. My training will take place under the sponsorship of Dr. Vera Krymskaya, a
leader in LAM research. The Krymskaya lab was the first to establish human LAM cell cultures to demonstrate
efficacy of rapamycin for inhibition of mTORC1 and abrogating LAM cell growth. This work will be conducted at
the University of Pennsylvania, a world-class research institution with a rich intellectual environment,
collaborative investigators and extensive resources for the pursuit of biomedical research. Together, the

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) causes profound loss of quality of life and over $10B of expense to the US
healthcare system annually. Treatment options are primarily limited to corticosteroids, antibiotics and surgery.
CRS is conventionally divided into two major forms, one without nasal polyp formation (CRSsNP), and one with
nasal polyp formation (CRSwNP). A particularly severe form of CRSwNP is Aspirin Exacerbated Respiratory
Disease (AERD). Patients with AERD suffer from both nasal polyposis and asthma, usually in severe forms. The
fundamental hypothesis to be tested by this proposal is that a combination of defects in the immune barrier along
with activation of inflammatory and structural cells drives pathogenesis in CRS and AERD. Secondary central
goals of this proposal include advancement of our knowledge of pathogenesis of CRSwNP and AERD,
development of a new microparticle (MP) based tool for diagnosis of AERD and assessment of the importance
of hormones and cytokines in epithelial activation in CRS pathogenesis. We will use a combination of large,
robust studies of patients undergoing surgery for CRS and cutting edge laboratory-based and bioinformatics
approaches to study CRS pathogenic mechanisms. The proposed work is divided into three specific aims. In the
first aim, we will test the hypothesis that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a hallmark feature of
CRSwNP reflecting underlying endocrine disturbances and associates with severity and outcomes in CRSwNP.
We will relate the extent of EMT in epithelial scrapings from CRSwNP, AERD and controls to disease endpoints
to test our hypotheses that hormonal changes, Oncostatin M and Epiregulin play important roles in CRS-
associated EMT and CRS pathogenesis. In the second aim, we will test the hypothesis that inflammatory
leukocytes, structural cells and mast cells are activated in CRSwNP and AERD and contribute to symptoms and
disease activity. We will use an innovative MP assay combined with flow cytometry and RNASeq (Drop-Seq) to
assess activation of basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, platelets, endothelial cells and epithelial cells in controls
and patients with CRSwNP or AERD. We will relate cell activation to disease severity assessed using CT,
endoscopy, treatment history, questionnaires and tissue pathology. We will link inflammatory endpoints to EMT
and important clinical endpoints. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that greater activation of eosinophils,
basophils, mast cells and platelets explains the greater severity of disease in AERD. In aim three, we will use
the MP assay to identify patients with undiagnosed AERD among a large cohort of patients with CRSwNP and
comorbid asthma. We will confirm or eliminate diagnosis of AERD with aspirin challenge to validate the MP test.

In humans, mutations in the aristaless-like homebox 3 (ALX3) transcription factor encoding gene are linked to
the autosomal recessive disorder frontonasal dysplasia (FND). FND phenotypes include midline neurocranium
defects like dysmorphic frontal, maxillary and ethmoid bones, along with soft tissue defects like wide and short
nasal bridge, and bifid nasal tip. Yet, mouse Alx3 mutants in an otherwise wild-type background do not display
FND phenotypes. Therefore, there is no animal model for ALX3 linked FND. However, genetic control of the
zebrafish craniofacial skeleton is similar to mammals. Thus, I propose that the zebrafish model will fill the gap
in our understanding of this genetic disease. Specifically, we generated an alx3 loss of function mutant allele
with neurocranium phenotypes consistent with those seen in humans.
My preliminary results show that the zebrafish system is suitable for this research. Transcriptomic and in situ
gene expression analysis show that the alx3 gene is specifically expressed in frontonasal neural crest cells
(fNCC), the progenitor cells of the frontonasal skeleton in the neurocranium. CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis
demonstrates that alx3 function is required for proper development of the frontonasal skeleton elements like
the ethmoid plate, and the parasphenoid bone. Like humans, zebrafish alx3 mutants develop midline skeletal
defects. Specifically, homozygous alx3 mutants display (1) an excess of cartilage at the posterior ethmoid
plate, (2) loss of cellular organization in the ethmoid plate, and (3) a blunted parasphenoid bone. In this
proposal I will test the hypothesis that alx3 cell-autonomously functions in frontonasal neural crest
cells to control cellular identity in the zebrafish neurocranium within a conserved genetic network. I
will directly test this hypothesis by examining alx3 expression and function with cellular resolution expression
studies and cellular transplantations (AIM1), by determining how alx3 controls cell fate with lineage tracing
(AIM2), and by analyzing if alx3 functions in a genetic network conserved between fish and mammals during
neurocranium development (AIM3). The results collected from this proposal will form the foundation for my
long-term objective of understanding frontonasal development in general and the origin of pathogenesis of
human FND linked to ALX3. This work will potentially inform and improve medical practices including genetic
counseling, diagnosis and disease management. This proposal contains a training plan that will provide me
with both scientific training and career development opportunities to support the intention of PA-19-188, to
promote engagement of under-represented minorities as independent investigators in health-related research.
This plan includes course work, seminars, attending local, regional and national meetings, sponsor and co-
sponsor path correction meetings, a mentoring committee with internal and external members that will oversee
my transition to independence, and access to multiple research and career development resources available
only at the University of Colorado - Anschutz Medical campus and the Department of Craniofacial Biology.","2500",

assays of conduction, post-mortem myelin staining, or in-vivo diffusion MRI. In the normal aging rhesus monkey,
post-mortem electron microscopy (EM) has confirmed myelin breakdown at the ultrastructural level; however,
EM studies cannot be scaled up to evaluate the entire 100-cc monkey brain or the larger human brain. Myelin
stains suffer from various technical and practical limitations that impede quantification. Other methods, like label-
free spectral confocal reflectance imaging (SCoRe), and coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS), are
promising, but like EM, are expensive, slow and difficult to apply to large brain sections. While SCoRe and CARS
microscopy work in reflectance, opening the possibility of in-vivo imaging through a cranial window in the small-
animal brain, a complementary method is needed that is validated, quantitative and high-resolution, to survey
the status of myelin in whole-brain sections of monkey or human brain. Here we propose to optimize and
validate quantitative birefringence microscopy (qBRM) for high-resolution imaging of normal and
abnormal myelin. The qBRM image provides, for every pixel, two quantitative measures: a) the relative phase
retardance, which is linearly proportional to the density of the birefringent medium and the organization of its
anisotropy; and b) the local orientation of the optic axis of the myelin, which corresponds to the direction of the
structural anisotropy. Archived brain tissues from two rhesus monkey models of myelin damage are available for
this project at the Boston University Medical Campus (BUMC). In Aim 1 we will automate the function of our
birefringence microscope with computer-controlled, motorized polarizer components and stage-positioning, to
facilitate fast, automated image acquisition (montaging) of large tissue sections (up to 40x40 mm). We will also
employ massively-parallel computing resources at BU to rapidly render the multi-megapixel quantitative images.
In Aim 2 we will validate our qBRM image measures by comparing them, in the same sections, with myelin
identified by myelin stains, such as FluoroMyelin Red, and with label-free spectral confocal reflectance (SCoRe)
microscopy. In Aim 3, We will demonstrate the untility of qBRM for quantifying myelin by imaging tissue sections
from three monkey models of myelin pathology: a) behaviorally characterized young and old monkeys with
cognitive assessment; b) behaviorally characterized old monkeys with impaired hand movement produced by
motor-cortex injury and treated with mesenchymal stem-cell derived extracellular vesicles (EVs); c) behaviorally
characterized old monkeys with demonstrated cognitive impairments treated with EVs. Together this will
establish the validity and utility of qBRM for assessing myelin in the central nervous system in health and disease.","569055",

The reparative capacity in human articular cartilage is generally considered to be low or negligible, and this
intrinsic capacity decreases with age. As a result, articular cartilage injuries often result in irreversible damage
leading to osteoarthritis (OA). We and others have recently defined heterogeneity in articular chondrocytes at
both the molecular and cellular levels. Work in mice and other mammals has implicated a subset of cells in the
superficial layer of articular cartilage as the source of regenerative capacity; to date, these findings have not
been extended to a specific population of chondrocytes in human ontogeny. Our previous studies have shown
that unlike adult chondrocytes, fetal chondrocytes are highly proliferative and migratory, and exhibit high basal
levels of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3). Our preliminary data also
nominate cells expressing integrin α4 (ITGA4) and bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR1B) as the most
immature chondrocytes in human articular cartilage throughout human development. Moreover, we have shown
at the molecular level that ITGA4+BMPR1B+ cells are enriched for active STAT3 (pSTAT3), which are known to
drive proliferation, anabolism and preserve differentiation potential. Importantly, adult ITGA4+BMPR1B+ cells are
localized to the superficial layer and also express the highest levels of SOX9, which is strongly identified with
osteochondral progenitor identity and anabolism; indeed, ITGA4+BMPR1B+ cells are robustly chondro- and
osteogenic in vitro. The percentage of ITGA4+BMPR1B+ cells and levels of pSTAT3 tightly correlate with
biological age, decreasing from 20-30% in developing joints down to 1-2% in aged adult healthy cartilage. We
hypothesize that active STAT3 is expressed in immature articular chondrocytes and is a permissive factor
required for immature cell anabolism and differentiation in response to specific instructive signals in the niche.
We propose to define the direct transcriptional targets of STAT3 in human articular chondrocytes at different
ontogenic stages and under conditions similar to the pro-inflammatory state driven by IL-6 family cytokines in
OA. To address how IL-6 family cytokines can drive varied biological and functional outcomes in a context-
specific manner, we will employ nanoproteomics and targeted mutagenesis to determine how specific post-
translational modifications in the core IL-6 family cytokine receptor gp130 differ in fetal vs. adult chondrocytes
stimulated with IL-6 family cytokines. Finally, we will apply single cell RNA-Seq to further refine the molecular
and cellular phenotype of immature articular chondrocytes. In parallel, we will assess the molecular and
functional consequences of STAT3 gain and loss of function in articular chondrocytes. We propose that cells
with higher levels of pSTAT3 will evidence broader differentiation potential in vivo, resulting from changes
mediated by STAT3 in chromatin conformation. The overall impact of this highly innovative study is to define the
cellular and molecular phenotype of immature articular chondrocytes throughout human ontogeny and to link
this to the potential for cartilage repair and/or regeneration during aging.","304425",

Barrett’s esophagus, the condition in which the normal squamous lining of the esophagus is replaced by a
metaplastic intestinal-type lining, is a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. This deadly cancer can be
prevented by radiofrequency ablation (RFA), an endoscopic procedure that burns away the cancer-prone
metaplastic lining. Presently, RFA is used only to eradicate Barrett’s esophagus that has precancerous
changes called dysplasia. After RFA, patients require regular endoscopic cancer surveillance because
Barrett’s metaplasia recurs frequently. Although RFA potentially could prevent cancer for the millions of
patients with non-dysplastic Barrett’s esophagus, RFA cannot be cost-effective for them unless it permanently
eradicates Barrett’s metaplasia. A condition called subsquamous intestinal metaplasia (SSIM) might underlie
the frequent recurrences of Barrett’s esophagus after RFA. In SSIM, Barrett’s cells are located under a layer of
normal esophageal squamous lining that shields them from destruction by RFA. Most Barrett’s patients have
SSIM, which could be the nidus for recurrent metaplasia after RFA. Our published data suggest that SSIM
develops when Barrett’s cells undergo a process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a
wound-healing event triggered by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). EMT endows Barrett’s cells with
migratory abilities that enable them to move under the adjacent squamous lining. EMT also activates cell
survival pathways that could enable Barrett’s cells wounded by RFA to survive. Thus, EMT appears to underlie
the development of SSIM, and EMT might well underlie the high frequency of metaplasia recurrences after
RFA. In Barrett’s cells, we have reported that acid and bile (the damaging factors in gastric juice that refluxes
into the esophagus in GERD patients) induce oxidative stress that results in the accumulation of a molecule
called HIF-1α. We also published that acidic bile salts induce signaling through a molecular pathway that
causes Barrett’s cells to increase their production of ZEB1, a molecule that plays a key role in inducing the
EMT that triggers the cell motility leading to the development of SSIM. Our new experiments demonstrate that
acidic bile salts activate the function of a molecule called APE1/Ref-1 that is required for activation of HIF-1α.
We show that activated HIF-1α mediates increased production of the ZEB1 that induces EMT. Thus, we
hypothesize that GERD-induced APE1/Ref-1 function that activates HIF-1α is the pivotal event in initiating
EMT that enables Barrett’s cells to form SSIM and to survive RFA, and that these events might be prevented
by drugs that inhibit APE1/Ref-1. The aims of this study are to elucidate the mechanism(s) whereby APE1/Ref-
1 signaling and HIF-1α activation contribute to the induction of EMT, and to explore the role of the APE1/Ref-1-
HIF-1α signaling axis in EMT induced by exposure to acidic bile salts in Barrett’s esophagus. Our ultimate goal
is to determine how SSIM develops and how a targeted treatment might be used to prevent that development,
findings that could provide the means to eradicate Barrett’s esophagus and its cancer risk permanently.","324871",

While the Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) has long been recognized as a potential
contributor to metastasis in breast and other cancers, how and whether it is required for
metastasis has remained controversial. Our data suggest that promotion of metastasis by cells

metastasis occurs, focusing on non-canonical activation of GLI transcription factors, and will
determine whether a range of inhibitors that target downstream or non-canonical activators of
GLI, or that target a central transcription factor, Six1, will inhibit tumor cell crosstalk and thus
inhibit tumor progression and metastasis in heterogeneous tumors.","NCI","10296675","11/24/2021 12:00:00 AM","PA-18-484","5R01CA224867-04","5","R01","CA","224867","04"," ","SNYDERWINE, ELIZABETH G","12/1/2018 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2023 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-OBT-B(02)M]"," ","1889696","FORD, HEIDE L.","LEWIS, MICHAEL T.","06","PHARMACOLOGY","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","US","39.708143","-104.724958","1199905","UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER","Aurora","CO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","800452570","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2022 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2022"," "," ","NCI","453152","99251"," ","Virtually all breast cancer (BC) related deaths result from metastatic burden rather than the primary tumor. It has
long been thought that primary tumors are heterogeneous, with only some cells having the capacity to
metastasize. Our work suggests that this view is oversimplified, and that non-metastatic cells can become more
metastatic due to paracrine-mediated signaling from other cancer cells. Understanding this mechanism will
uncover new strategies to inhibit metastatic disease.
To understand crosstalk between cells of varying metastatic potential in heterogeneous tumors, we examined
whether metastatic cells expressing the EMT-inducing transcription factors (TFs), Twist1 and Snail1, can
promote metastatic properties in intrinsically non-metastatic cells. Our data show that, in a manner dependent
on a third EMT TF, Six1, the EMT TFs can non-cell autonomously enhance metastatic properties.
Mechanistically, we show that cells expressing Six1 mediate paracrine activation of GLI-mediated signaling in
intrinsically non-metastatic cells, leading to increased aggressiveness and metastasis of these cells. Importantly,
paracrine mediated activation of GLI can occur through non-canonical pathways independent of Hedgehog (Hh)
ligands and Smoothened (SMO)-mediated Hedgehog signaling.
Our strong data lead us to hypothesize that SMO inhibitors, which are in clinical trials, will fail in a large
percentage of BC patients. We hypothesize that targeting GLI directly will be effective in a broader range of
breast tumors (encompassing subtypes that show features of EMT), and that determining the molecular
mechanism of non-canonical paracrine GLI activation will lead to additional therapies that are effective in a broad
range of BCs. Further, we hypothesize that targeting the central mediator, Six1, using our novel small molecule
inhibitor, will be efficacious in the broadest range of BCs due to its cell and non-cell autonomous role in tumor
progression. To test these related hypotheses, we will first determine the paracrine mechanism by which
EMT/metastatic cells increase the aggressiveness of intrinsically non-metastatic cells, focusing on VEGF-C and
its downstream signaling as key mediators. We will then perform a large scale head-to-head comparison of
inhibitors of EMT/metastatic and non-metastatic cell crosstalk in breast patient derived xenograft (PDX) models
that encompass various breast cancer subtypes and are metastatic, to determine which inhibitors are efficacious
in a broader range of tumors, and to characterize the types of tumors that will respond to specific inhibitors.
Our work may provide a partial explanation for why SMO inhibitors have been ineffective as single agents in
tumors such as BCs. Further, by uncovering a new mechanism by which EMT promotes metastasis, and by
deciphering the molecular components of that mechanism, we may not only provide an explanation for the
controversy in the field, but may more importantly identify highly efficacious means to target the many BCs in
which a percentage of cells have undergone an EMT.","552403",

Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects, including aortic valves and the greater arteries, are estimated to cause
approximately 30% of these congenital heart diseases, and they are treated with surgical correction and/or
replacement. It remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced cardiac contractility or altered
intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis, including aortic stenosis, bicuspid or tricuspid aortic
valves. To understand the mechanotransduction causation downstream of blood flow and shear stress
sensing, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to integrate advanced laser optics, imaging
computation, and genetic models to decouple intracardiac flow dynamics from myocardial contractility that
modulates Notch1b-mediated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) with translational implication to
aortic valve disease.","NHLBI","10320974","12/10/2021 12:00:00 AM","PA-19-056","5R01HL129727-06","5","R01","HL","129727","06"," ","EVANS, FRANK","7/9/2015 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2024 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-SBIB-Q(03)M]"," ","6653392","HSIAI, TZUNG K","MARSDEN, ALISON L","33","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","092530369","RN64EPNH8JC6","092530369","RN64EPNH8JC6","US","34.104809","-118.41105","577505","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES","LOS ANGELES","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","900952000","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2022 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2022 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2022"," "," ","NHLBI","311319","75717"," ","Shear Stress and Light-Field to Elucidate the Initiation of Cardiac Outflow Tract
Biomechanical forces modulate cardiac morphogenesis, and mutations in mechano-sensitive signaling
pathways result in congenital heart defects. During the previous funding cycle, our team custom-built a Light-
Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) with sub-voxel resolution to enhance axial resolution needed to
provide a large field-of-view. This laser optical system allowed for imaging pulsatile vs. oscillatory shear stress-
mediated Notch signaling to initiate endocardial trabeculation. We demonstrated that spatial (/x) and
temporal (/t) variations in shear stress modulates Notch-EphrinB2-Neureguilin-1 signaling in the
endocardium to activate erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase (ErbB2) that promotes proliferation of trabeculation.
By integrating LSFM, computation, and transgenic models, we further established that trabeculation dissipates
intracardiac shear stress-generated kinetic energy; thus, mitigating ventricular remodeling. However, it remains
unclear what would be the consequences of reduced myocardial contractility or altered intracardiac flow
dynamics on valve morphogenesis. Thus, we seek to integrate light-sheet (Bessel-Gaussian beam arrays) with
a new 2) light-field (microlens array). The former provides non-diffracting illumination, and the latter provides
volumetric detection as a paradigm shift to image both myocardial contractility and intracardiac flow dynamics
in the outflow tract (OFT). Our preliminary study reveals that shear-mediated Notch1b expression in the
endocardium of OFT regulates endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT); however, the
mechanotransduction causation whereby myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress reciprocally
interact to form bicuspid valves and subsequent remodeling to multi-cuspid valves remains elusive. Thus, our
hypothesis is that integration of the new light-field system with imaging computation enhances spatiotemporal
resolution needed to decouple myocardial contraction from intracardiac flow dynamics that modulates
Notch1b-EndoMT to mediate valve morphogenesis in the OFT. In Aim 1, we plan to integrate light-sheet with
the new light-field system for 4-D volumetric imaging of valve formation in the OFT. Our goal is to capture
myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress at one snapshot. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the
interaction between intracardiac shear stress and myocardial contractility underlying valve morphogenesis. Our
goal is to decouple hemodynamic shear from contractile forces that mediate Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. In
Aim 3, we will determine the relative role of shear stress and contractility underlying Notch1b-mediated
EndoMT. Our goal is to elucidate the relative role of contractility and intracardiac stress to transmit Notch1b-
EndoMT signaling underlying bicuspid-valve formation. Overall, our team aims to establish the micro-
environment in which intracardiac flow dynamics and myocardial contractility interact to modulate OFT valve
formation, with clinical significance to aortic valvular disease.","387036",

Integrin-based adhesions are central to the functions of blood and vascular cells. The
heterogeneity of adhesions and their dynamic evolution has complicated efforts to study their fine
composition, assembly, and disassembly. Our studies have shown that a transition between two
adhesion archetypes is controlled by a simple binary molecular switch of vinculin competition with
and displacement of RIAM or lamellipodin(Lpd), members of the MRL family, from binding sites
on talin's rod domain. Furthermore, we developed methods to image the complex of MRL proteins
with integrins and talin (MIT complex) and showed that it formed the tips of “sticky fingers,” cellular
protrusions that sense the density of matrix proteins and physical state of the substrate during
mesenchymal cell migration. mesenchymal cell migration. We hypothesize that the MIT
complex represents one among many distinct modules that contribute to the overall
structure and function of integrin- based adhesions. This suggests the paradigm that the
integrin adhesome can be analyzed as a dynamic assembly of these modules, which form prior to
entry into the adhesions. This concept has enabled us to propose a new approach to studying
adhesions by developing methods to purify each module formed prior to integrin ligation. To test
this paradigm, we propose to purify 4 such modules and to characterize each for a) the presence
of talin-activated integrins b) characterize its protein composition. c) establish its biochemical
topology and regulation d) visualize it in living cells and e) evaluate its functions The proposed
experiments will generate foundational data for the adhesion field in three ways: a) the integrin
adhesome will be re- interpreted as a compendium of modular components; each with its own
specific composition. b) The functional studies will identify new regulators of blood and vascular
cell adhesion and signaling that may be exploitable as therapeutic targets c) A complete definition
of the protein composition of each module will serve as a public resource for the analysis of
integrin-based adhesions and will be hypothesis-generating for future studies to understand the
regulation of assembly of each module and its functional outputs.","708262",

My lab’s contributions have helped bring lung biology to the forefront of stem cell biology. Our major focus has

that have begun to define cell-cell crosstalk between epithelial progenitors and other supporting cell types in
the lung. We can now model the formation of airway- and alveolar-like structures from lung progenitor cells,
and we have a platform to understand differentiation control at the molecular level. This research program
seeks to build on our advances and to further develop lung organoids to interrogate the molecular
underpinnings of cell-cell interactions between epithelial progenitor cells and their environment in the adult lung
homeostasis and in diseased lung. We will determine the signals through which epithelial progenitors are
regulated by mesenchymal cells and endothelial cells during lung injury response and repair. Cells from
mouse models of lung disease will be used for single cell RNA-sequencing and in organoid systems to identify
cell autonomous and paracrine mechanisms that can be used for therapeutic intervention. We will refine our

need in the lung community for the study of progenitors and for regenerative medicine. While other groups are
focused on cataloging lung cell types, our strategies will provide essential tools to interrogate the biological

The Tumor Biology Program is one of two basic science Research Programs of the Abramson Cancer Center 
(ACC). This Program aims to catalyze research within the ACC to advance an understanding of mechanisms 
underlying tumorigenesis and to identify pathways that will enable novel preventive, diagnostic, prognostic and 
therapeutic approaches to cancer. Since its inception in the early 1970s, the Tumor Biology Program has 
continued to respond to emerging areas and advances in cancer research. The Program is currently organized 
around three central Aims: 1) Elucidate the molecular and cellular basis underlying cancer; 2) Understand the 
epigenetics of cancer; and 3) Investigate the tumor microenvironment and metastatic progression. Members of 
Tumor Biology are highly interactive, collaborating intra-Programmatically across scientific topics relevant to 
each Aim including genome integrity, cell signaling, metabolism, and viral pathways, with an eye on cancers of 
highest burden or health disparity in our catchment area. Ground-breaking discoveries in Tumor Biology 
uncovered novel mechanisms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, transcriptional control of cancer drug 
sensitivity, epigenetic regulation of inflammation, novel mechanisms of androgen-resistance in prostate cancer, 
and immune evasion by viral mimicry. New targets were translated to the clinic in collaboration with other 
Programs for early detection and treatment. The Tumor Biology Program is led by new and energetic Program 
co-Leaders (PLs) Shelley Berger, PhD and Sandra Ryeom, PhD, who together catalyze impactful intra- and 
inter-Programmatic collaborations by a variety of innovative methods. The PLs are instrumental in recruiting 
new members, mentoring junior faculty, stimulating interactions and meetings among faculty members, and 
organizing conferences and symposia. Tumor Biology Program members play key roles in the training and 
mentorship of high school students, PhD students, MD/PhD students, and MD or PhD postdoctoral fellows in 
cancer-related research through their leadership roles in the University of Pennsylvania Biomedical Graduate 
Studies (BGS), MD/PhD program (MSTP) and NIH T32 training grants. The continued success of the Tumor 
Biology Program is evidenced by the exceptional scientific progress of its members, demonstrated through 
high-impact publications with multi-institutional, inter- and intra-Programmatic collaborations, offering key 
insights into the biology of cancer. Currently, the Program has 53 members from 20 departments and five 
different schools with total funding of $25.7M (annual direct costs) of which 20.0M is peer-reviewed and $6.4M 
is NCI-funded. The Program has 67 R01-equivalents. Since 2015, Tumor Biology Program members published

for post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) that will relieve pain and improve function. We hypothesize that PTOA
is caused by maladaptive repair responses including activation of the pro-inflammatory pathways of innate
immunity that in turn result in pain, loss of function and structural decline. This Program addresses the hypothesis
through two highly-integrated aims: (1) innovative intra-articular treatments using small molecules, biologic
inhibitors and immunomodulatory cells to reduce pain and inflammation in the joint and (2) tissue engineering
using stem cell-based therapies for reconstruction of the damaged joint infrastructure. The investigators
collaborating in this program will coordinate testing of therapies in four animal models that mimic different
mechanisms of injury that initiate PTOA in patients. The experiments will take into consideration relevant factors
affecting joint physiology and treatment response. The effects of different therapeutic modalities will be evaluated
using group-standardized measurements of pain, function, inflammation and structure, so that results can be
compared across laboratories and the most promising therapeutic strategies prioritized for clinical trials.
We provide compelling evidence that sequential treatment of mesenchymal progenitors with BMP2 and non-
canonical Wnt5a, cultured in high density pellets, yield articular-like cells in vitro. These effects are reproduced
when small molecules Kartogenin (KGN), a chondrogenic small molecule targeting Runx1, and Foxy5, a Wnt5a
mimetic peptide, are sequentially used. Moreover, implantation of pellets, treated with BMP2 followed by Wnt5a,
into a rat chondral defect regenerate articular-like cartilage. Our preliminary data also demonstrate an influence
of physical exercise on cartilage preservation and joint function in a rat model of PTOA. Thus, we ask whether
the source of stem cells can differentially promote hyaline cartilage regeneration and if physical rehabilitation
can improve pellet integration and treatment outcome. Specifically, we aim to compare the efficacy of somatic
cells (human articular chondrocytes and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells) to that of patient-
specific, and readily available, pluripotent stem cells. We hypothesize that cell plasticity will determine the
potential of adult versus pluripotent stem cells to treat cartilage degeneration, and that successful
restoration of cartilage integrity via cellular and physical therapy will lead to enhanced functional
outcomes and reduced nociception in vivo.
We will first establish the capacity of iPSC-derived MSCs to that of adipose-derived and human articular
cartilage MSCs with and without sequential treatment with KGN and Foxy5 to regenerate articular cartilage
following implantation of control or treated high-density pellets into a rat chondral defect model of PTOA.
Histological evaluations, matrix synthesis, mechanical testing and molecular imaging analyses will be performed
(Aim 1). We will then assess the effect of cellular and physical treatment of animals on long-term
functional, nociceptive, and centralized pain outcomes. We will evaluate functional outcomes in control and
experimental rats that receive either iPSC-derived MSCs or the most effective adult stem cell source identified
in Aim 1. Specifically, gait, voluntary running, muscle strength, mechanical testing, and allodynia analyses will
also be performed. We will also assess the neurological changes that often lead to chronic joint pain (Aim 2)."," ",

Vimentin intermediate filaments augment cytoskeletal deformability and directed migration of
individual mesenchymal cells, but their role in multicellular migration, tractions, and coordination is
poorly understood. Such collective migration of mechanically connected cells is crucial for embryonic
development, wound healing, and tumor invasion. Gain of vimentin is associated with the epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT), where tightly-connected epithelial cells downregulate cell-cell adhesions and
acquire an individual mesenchymal phenotype. However, cells that migrate collectively in groups can also
express vimentin in combination with cell-cell junctions (e.g. cadherins). For instance, “leader cells” at wound
fronts can exhibit an elongated morphology with vimentin, while remaining partially connected to migratory
followers. Given these questions, there exists a critical need to elucidate the role of vimentin in leader cells
and its contributions to collective cell migration.
 Our overall objective is to elucidate the functional role of vimentin in leader and follower cells for directed
cell motility, multicellular tractions, and cell-cell coordination. In particular, we consider several fundamental
questions: 1) How does vimentin affect confined migration and cellular deformability? 2) How does vimentin
affect collective tractions? 3) How does vimentin affect cell-cell adhesions and coordinated motility? 4) How do
vimentin-high and vimentin-low cells interact during collective migration?
 Our approach will integrate several complementary technologies for precision measurement of collective
cell migration and mechanobiology. MPI: Guo is an Early Stage Investigator with extensive expertise in the
mechanics of soft and living materials, including vimentin networks and extracellular matrix. MPI: Wong is an
Early Stage Investigator with extensive expertise in collective migration and EMT, particularly single cell
tracking and analyses. Co-I: Goldman is a leader in the molecular biology of vimentin. This proposal is
structured around 3 aims: elucidate how vimentin affects cell shape, migration and deformability of multicellular
collectives in confinement (AIM 1), multicellular tractions in 3D matrix (AIM 2), and collective interactions of
“mosaic” spheroids with heterogeneous vimentin expression (AIM 3). Overall, this work will reveal new
fundamental insights into the role of vimentin in cell shape, motility, and mechanical integrity in collective
migration, with potential implications for tissue morphogenesis and tumor dissemination.","379159",

To devise novel treatments for craniofacial birth defects, disease, and injuries, more research is needed to
understand developmental mechanisms that control jaw length. The jaws often display a range of size-related
anomalies including mandibular hypoplasia, retrognathia, asymmetry, and clefting. Our study will provide critical
data to address this unmet need by focusing on how jaw length is regulated during the deposition and resorption
of bone. We employ a unique quail-duck chimeric system that we created for manipulating neural crest
mesenchyme (NCM), which are the precursor cells that form the jaw skeleton. Quail have much shorter jaws
than do duck. Transplanting NCM between quail and duck embryos generates chimeras with the jaw length of
the donor species, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which NCM accomplishes this complex
task remain largely unknown. In our published and preliminary studies, we uncover a direct correlation between
jaw length and the NCM-mediated expression of ligands, receptors, and effectors of the Transforming Growth
Factor-Beta (Tgfβ) pathway, which is known to promote bone deposition and resorption. We observe that Tgfβ
receptor 1 (Tgfβr1), and targets including an osteogenic factor (Runx2) as well as a bone-resorbing collagenase
(Mmp13) are highly upregulated in quail compared to duck. If we over-express Runx2 or Mmp13, we shorten the
jaw whereas inhibiting Mmp13 lengthens the jaw. We also find species-specific variation in Runx2 isoforms and
in the promoters of Tgfβr1 and Mmp13. Thus, we hypothesize that multiple hierarchical levels of gene regulation
in the TgfFβ pathway generate species-specific differences in sensitivity to TGFβ signaling, modulate bone
deposition and resorption, and enable NCM to control jaw length. To test our hypothesis, we propose three
complementary Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which NCM utilizes differential expression
of Tgfβr1 to control Tgfβ pathway activation, bone deposition and resorption, and jaw length. We will identify
species-specific regulatory elements and assay for cell-autonomous versus context-dependent mechanisms that
affect Tgfβr1 expression. In Aim 2, we will determine the extent to which NCM deploys combinatorial, spatial,
temporal, and/or species-specific expression of Runx2 isoforms to regulate targets, bone deposition and
resorption, and jaw length. We will identify developmental contexts in which Runx2 is alternatively spliced and
use gain- and loss-of-function approaches to interrogate the ability of Runx2 isoforms to control bone growth. In
Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which NCM leverages species-specific differences in Mmp13 regulation
to modulate jaw length. We will manipulate upstream transcriptional inputs and endogenous promoter elements
of Mmp13 and use gain- and loss-of-function strategies to test if regulatory changes to Mmp13 provide spatial
and temporal control over local resorption and growth of bone. Each Specific Aim is clinically relevant in providing
data on critical stages and mechanisms that could be targeted via novel molecular therapies to benefit patients
with jaw length defects. Currently invasive surgery and/or orthodontics are the only treatment options.","634072",

In the US alone CKD cost
Medicare an estimated 50 billion dollars for patients with CKD age 65 and older in 2013. Recent studies
revealed that after AKI renal epithelial cells undergo a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) and
G2/M cell cycle arrest through a Snail1-Twist1-p21 axis; these cells secrete profibrotic factors and contribute to
fibrosis progression. Therefore these three factors become promising potential drug targets for treating fibrosis,
but further development requires addressing several outstanding open questions. The temporal sequence and
causal relation between pEMT and cell cycle arrest is controversial, and the respective roles of Snail1, Twist1,
and p21 on regulating pEMT and cell cycle arrest is unclear. Addressing these questions requires quantitative
systems biology approaches beyond cell biology methods traditionally used in the field. In recent years my lab
has made progression on deep learning based image automated analysis for live cell images, CRISPR-based
gene editing, and mathematical modeling and other quantitative biology tools. These technological
developments position us to tackle the above-mentioned challenging questions related to kidney fibrosis.
Based on existing studies and our preliminary results, we hypothesize that there is a temporal order of the
three factors, with p21 initializing G2/M arrest, which is reinforced by subsequent upregulation of Snail1; Snail1
also activates, and Twist1 further maintains the pEMT program; due to their temporally varying roles,
effectiveness of targeting these factors depends on the timing of treatment. We will test the hypothesis with
quantitative imaging studies using established cell lines and primary renal epithelial cells and mathematical
analysis of competing models. In Aim 1, we will perform multi-color flow cytometry studies and time-lapse
imaging studies on progression of cell cycle, EMT, and other cell fates of cells under stimulation. The two types
of studies will provide complementary information on whether pEMT and cell cycle are tightly coupled, and will
map out the temporal sequence of events of various cell fate change as well as correlation to expression levels
of the three factors. In Aim 2, we will monitor the temporal profiles of these factors through fluorescence protein
tagging in single cells, and use the data to evaluate an ensemble of models to identify one or a set of minimal
network regulating EMT and G2/M arrest. We will then further examine the roles of individual factors through
model analysis and a series of inhibition experiments.
Success of the proposed research will provide mechanistic understanding of the regulatory network of cell
cycle arrest and EMT in renal epithelial cells. The proposed research is our starting point for an emerging field
of quantitative systems biology on kidney fibrosis. We expect that introducing quantitative approaches will
greatly accelerate future development of treatment strategies on the increasing global health challenge
imposed by progression of fibrosis, which currently lacks effective treatment.","307759",

Accumulating evidence indicates that the incidence of HPV-associated neoplasia in HIV-positive individuals is
substantially higher than in HIV-negative individuals despite effective antiretroviral therapy. These data strongly
suggest that HIV may play a critical role in development of HPV-associated neoplasia of the anus, cervix and
oropharyngeal cavity. However the mechanisms by which it does so are poorly understood. Our published
work and preliminary data show that HIV may interact with oral and anal epithelia creating a tissue
microenvironment where epithelial cells lose tight and adherence junctions. These epithelia have multiple
changes consistent with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a multistep epigenetic process characterized
by loss of cell adhesion and increased mobility of epithelial cells. EMT is important in cell differentiation during
embryogenesis but also plays a critical role in neoplastic progression. Our data show that oral and anal
mucosal epithelial biopsies obtained from HIV-infected individuals show typical signs of EMT, i.e., the
adherens junction protein E-cadherin is down-regulated and vimentin expression is up-regulated. Exposure of
tonsil epithelial cells from HIV-uninfected individuals to HIV tat and gp120 proteins leads to induction of EMT.
Additionally we observed that HIV infection is associated with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) in mucosal epithelia, which may also be involved
in induction of EMT. Finally, it is known that HPV oncoproteins E6/E7 can induce the EMT phenotype. Thus,
there are several pathways through which HIV and HPV may interact with mucosal epithelia, and may
synergize to establish EMT with consequent potentiation of HPV-associated neoplasia. In general the EMT
phenotype is reversible and EMT cells may transition back and forth between EMT and the normal state, a
process known as mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). Induction of MET or inhibition of EMT may
represent a novel approach to prevention and treatment of HPV-associated oropharyngeal, cervical and anal
neoplasia and may be a novel approach to reducing the high incidence of HPV-associated malignancy in HIV-
infected individuals. Accordingly, our specific aims are: (1) To investigate mechanisms of HIV-associated EMT
in cervical and anal mucosal epithelial cells and induction of MET in these cells by suppression of vimentin and
upregulation of E-cadherin expression, (2) To investigate synergy between HIV and HPV in development of
the EMT phenotype, and (3) To study the role of suppression of HIV- and HPV- induced EMT and activation of
MET in the reduction of HPV-associated cervical and anal cell transformation and invasion. Knowledge
generated through this work will be of great value to understanding the mechanisms by which HIV and HPV
interact to potentiate development of HPV-associated epithelial neoplasia. This knowledge may also lead to
development of compounds that may be useful for treatment of HPV-associated cancers and pre-cancers in
the setting of HIV infection through inhibition of HIV/HPV-induced EMT and activation of MET.","369431",

Pancreatic cancer is a deadly disease with a dismal prognosis and a high frequency of distant metastasis. One
likely reason for the frequent metastases in pancreatic cancer is the ability of malignant cells in the primary tumor
to invade veins, providing direct access to the liver. While this intravasation is a key first step in metastasis, little
is known about the molecular and cellular alterations that underlie this process. Foci of cancer cell intravasation
are small and complex, requiring high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) approaches to study them. In this
Research Test Bed of our Center for 3D Multiscale Cancer Imaging, we will comprehensively characterize the
morphological, cellular, and molecular alterations of foci of intravasation in 3D in human pancreatic cancer
samples. In collaboration with Technology Development Unit 1, we will employ our novel deep learning 3D
reconstruction approach CODA to serially sectioned pancreatic cancer samples with venous invasion to quantify
morphological and cellular features of intravasation. We will also perform multi-dimensional immune profiling of
these intravasation foci in 3D using imaging mass cytometry, which can label with 40 antibodies on each tissue
section. These analyses will allow us to compare the tumor microenvironment in foci of intravasation to that in
other areas of cancer and in uninvolved veins. In collaboration with Technology Development Unit 2, we will
analyze the gene expression changes in these intravasation foci by applying a newly developed spatial
transcriptomics/proteomics approach (DBit-Seq) to pancreatic cancer samples previously reconstructed by
CODA. This approach will provide the first 3D multi-scale models of venous invasion in human pancreatic cancer,
providing unprecedented morphological, cellular, and molecular detail of the process of intravasation and
initiation of metastasis. In addition, our Research Test Bed will provide a critical opportunity to implement,
validate, and iteratively improve the novel approaches from the two Technology Development Centers. We will
work closely with these Technology Development Centers in order to evaluate the performance of CODA and
DBit-Seq in our human pancreatic tissue samples, allowing validation of the cell type identification and molecular
alterations by complementary techniques. The studies in our Research Test Bed will promote significant
improvement of the CODA and DBit-Seq imaging platforms while also providing important biological insights into
the initiation of metastasis in pancreatic cancer."," ",

Project Narrative
Women are a vital part of the armed forces and veterans' community. The population of women veterans has
risen and is projected to continue to rise. In the United States, one in seven women has or will develop breast
cancer (BC). Therefore, we can anticipate that approximately 237,500 female veterans will be affected by BC in
their lifetimes. The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a sub-type of BC lacking estrogen, progesterone, and
HER2 receptors, has a dismal prognosis. New insights into the disease and new therapeutic options thus must
be developed. By revealing its mechanism of action, the proposed study aims to demonstrate CCN5 as a novel
for TNBC. Our findings will directly inform the design and help interpret the results of potential clinical trials of
CCN5-activation therapy in TNBC patients.","VA","10367722","10/18/2021 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-21-022","1IK6BX005769-01","1","IK6","BX","005769","01"," "," ","10/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2026 12:00:00 AM","ZRD1-RCSR-K(01)"," ","2093785","BANERJEE, SUSHANTA K","Not Applicable","05","Unavailable","844272125","K2Q8HL5K1ZF2","844272125","K2Q8HL5K1ZF2","US","39.067164","-94.527526","481049","KANSAS CITY VA MEDICAL CENTER","KANSAS CITY","MO","Independent Hospitals","641282226","UNITED STATES","N","10/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2022 12:00:00 AM","999","Other","2022"," "," "," "," "," "," ","7. Project Summary/Abstract
 Breast cancer (BC) is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by a mixed bag of cells. BC is
broadly classified into luminal, HER2+, and basal-like based on differential expression of estrogen, progesterone,
and HER-2 receptor proteins found inside and on the surface of the cancer cells. Basal-like, which is about 10-
20% of BC, tests negative for both hormone receptors and HER2, considered triple-negative BC (TNBC). TNBC
is characterized by resistance to chemotherapy, acquisition of the stem character, and unfavorable prognoses
due to its highly metastatic phenotype and more likely to recur (come back) after treatment. TNBC patients still
have minimal treatment options, and chemotherapy is currently the only treatment available for metastatic TNBC.
Although checkpoint inhibitors, including PD-1 and PD-L1, were found to elicit a response in TNBC in initial
clinical trials, optimistic results have not yet emerged from these trials. Thus, the detection of appropriate targeted
therapeutic regimens for TNBC therapy and prevention has remained an elusive challenge to many laboratories.
During our program of identifying molecule(s) that could play an inhibitory role against TNBC, we found that
CCN5/WISP-2, a matricellular 29-35 kDa protein and a member of the CCN family of growth factors, can
modulate TNBC by imparting an inhibitory effect on tumor progression. We have demonstrated that induced
expression of CCN5 or administration of human recombinant CCN5 protein in TNBC cells resulted in suppressing
tumorigenic properties and induction of growth arrest. CCN5 is also known to inhibit the stemness, reverse the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, modulate CCN-family proteins, and activate ER-α in TNBC
cells. Building on these exciting findings, we now propose creating and establishing an innovative approach to
make CCN5 for a therapeutic implication of TNBC growth and metastasis by synthetic modification of CCN5
protein through the conjugation of polyethylene glycol (CCN5 PEGylation; PEG-CCN5). Our long-term goal is to
translate these findings to the clinic to treat TNBC. In Aim 1, we will generate a PEGylated CCN5 derivative for
TNBC therapy alone or in a combination of an anti-hormone or chemotherapy and Characterize the novel
biomarkers to improve diagnosis and therapeutic outcome. In Aim 2, we will develop drug repurposing strategies
for targeted activation of CCN5 for therapies to slow or arrest breast cancer initiation or progression in pre-clinical
mouse models. Lastly, in Aim 3, by dissecting the effect of CCN5 on CCN-family proteins (CCN1 and CTGF),
major tumorigenesis drivers in TNBC, we will determine how CCN5 governs reprogramming mesenchymal to
epithelial transition (MET), apoptosis, tumor growth inhibition, and mouse survival. These studies are expected
to identify an optimal PEGylated protein or a CCN5-activator that will inhibit TNBC growth and progression and
sensitize TNBC cells to tamoxifen and Paclitaxel with minimal systemic toxicity or ill effects on healthy cells or
organs. A novel mechanism of action of CCN5 will be found. Thus, these approaches should significantly
advance knowledge on the therapeutic utility of CCN5 and its mechanistic insights in the suppression of TNBC.
We will use multiple state-of-art techniques and our multi-disciplinary team's unique collective expertise to
complete the goal."," ",

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tumor cellular heterogeneity presents a formidable challenge to the development of effective cancer therapeutics. In addition to well-studied genetic heterogeneity resulting from mutation and clonal selection, there is mounting evidence for a fundamental role of epigenetic heterogeneity in mediating therapeutic resistance. Epigenetic mechanisms regulating cellular differentiation generate hierarchically organized cellular clones within tumors. At the apex of these hierarchies are cancer stem cells (CSCs) which drive tumor growth and metastasis. CSCs are endowed with phenotypic plasticity enabling them to transition between mesenchymal and epithelial-like states, processes regulated by the tumor microenvironment. CSCs also display intrinsic resistance to cytotoxic agents and radiation therapy and also may be resistant to molecularly targeted therapies aimed at bulk tumor populations. CSC heterogeneity, plasticity, and therapeutic resistance have profound implications for development of effective cancer therapies.    
   
Over the past decade, our laboratory has identified markers for CSCs in breast cancer, as well as other tumor types and developed in vitro and mouse models that have facilitated isolation and characterization of these cells. We have identified a number of cell intrinsic and microenvironmentally driven pathways that regulate these cells facilitating development of CSC-targeting drugs, a number of which have now entered clinical trials. We propose to extend these studies by applying single-cell genomic and proteomic technologies to characterize CSC heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. We will develop novel technologies to capture and molecularly interrogate circulating CSCs in molecularly annotated PDX models, as well as in primary patient blood samples. These technologies will facilitate more precise selection of agents to target CSCs, as well as facilitating real time assessment of therapeutic efficacy for patients on CTC targeting clinical trials. The successful targeting of CSCs has the potential to significantly improve the outcomes of patients with breast cancer, as well as other malignancies.","837000",

Patients with a previous joint injury are at risk for early
development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) even with reconstructive surgery. PTOA is seen in
younger patients than age-related osteoarthritis and it has a higher incidence in populations that have high
physical occupational demands (i.e., military personnel). Currently, PTOA treatment is primarily for pain until
joints fail and joint replacement surgery, an expensive treatment associated with a long rehabilitation. The
overall goal of my research is to develop a targeted nanomedicine that can halt cartilage degeneration,
improve quality of life and reduce the need for joint replacement in patients. The ability to detect early cartilage
damage in traumatic injury or degenerative arthritis has been limited, preventing treatment when therapies may
be more beneficial. Depletion of proteoglycans/glycoproteins on the surface of the cartilage in these disorders
results in unmasking of the underlying type II collagen (CII). This allows CII to serve as an immunologically
recognizable target for monoclonal antibody to type II collagen (MabCII). Fluorescent MabCII can be used for
diagnosis of cartilage injury or degeneration or MabCII coupled to nanosomes can target encapsulated drugs
for localized delivery to the cartilage lesion. Our preliminary evidence shows a similar strategy can target and
recruit reparative chondrocytes or mesenchymal stem cells to the damaged site. Thus, MabCII is used in a
comprehensive treatment plan for directing reparative cells to lesions of the articular cartilage and meniscal
cartilages and monitoring this by an innovative fluorescent arthroscopy. In addition, recruitment and integration
of the reparative cells in the cartilage lesions is optimized by reducing matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)
production in the joint by intra-articular injection of a pharmacological inhibitor of the activation of the nuclear
factor kappa B (NF-KB) pathway encapsulated in MabCII-targeted nanosomes. These procedures are
extremely novel and paradigm shifting for the diagnosis and treatment of joint injury and disease. I am using
them for: (1) early diagnosis of damaged and degenerative areas of articular surface and meniscal
cartilages in the pig knee using a sensitive, MabCII antibody-guided method of fluorescent arthroscopy
(FA). Our PTOA model uses surgically-induced injuries to meniscal and articular cartilages in the knee of the
domestic pig. The pig knee closely resembles a human joint in size, weight-bearing requirements and cartilage
thickness. The damage is visualized through its binding to fluorescent MabCII using fluorescent arthroscopy, a
new procedure that we have developed, and confirmed by histopathology. After FA characterization of the
injury, (2) reparative cells are targeted to the area of damaged cartilages in the knee with MabCII
antibody. We are investigating the therapeutic efficacy of fluorescent, MabCII-targeted chondrocytes or
mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow and adipose tissues intra-articularly injected into joints
where articular or meniscal cartilages have been surgically damaged monitoring the cellular localization and
persistence by FA. Cell to cell recruitment at the cartilage lesion in the knee is facilitated by an innovative
system of biotin/avidin ligands on the surface of the reparative cells and multivalent antibody recruitment of
cells binding type II collagen. Reparative tissues are analyzed over time by histopathology and gene
expression by RT-PCR. We are (3) further optimizing the recruitment and integration of replacement
cells in the cartilage lesion by treatment with MabCII-targeted nanosomes loaded with an inhibitor of
the activation of the NF-κB pathway to minimize MMP, a known factor in degradation of cartilage
matrices. Diminishing MMP production will be a prototypic target for enhancing reparative efforts. The MabCII-
targeted nanosomes encapsulating a selective inhibitor of human IKK-2, an activator of the NF-κB pathway,
will be used as a local delivery system to reduce MMPs in damaged cartilage lesions prior to treatment with
reparative cells enhancing their survival at the degenerative site.

Neural crest and ectodermal placode cells are both transient embryonic progenitor cells that
arise from the neural plate border. They then either invaginate or undergo an epithelial to
mesenchymal transition, undergo reshaping or migration and differentiate into various
derivatives ranging from ganglia and sensory organs of the peripheral nervous system to (in the
case of neural crest) bone and cartilage of the face, cornea of the eye to pigmentation of the
body. About 10% of human birth defects, such as CHARGE or DiGeorge syndromes or
Hirschprung's disease, affect early neural crest or placode development. However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying these defects are largely unknown. Several cancers also
originate from the neural crest including the peripheral nervous system derived neuroblastoma,
the most common malignancy of infancy, as well as melanoma, pheocromocytoma and other
endocrine tumor types. The proposed experiments promise to illuminate the molecular and
cellular processes that result in early formation of neural crest and ectodermal placode cells and
their derivatives. The results of this study may inform upon diagnosis, therapeutic intervention
and also yield approaches guiding maintenance of neural crest and placodal stem cells for the
purpose of repair and regeneration.

 In the early embryo, the neural plate border region contributes to diverse cell fates, ranging from neural
crest cells and ectodermal placode cells to neurons of the central nervous system. Despite extensive studies of
the neural crest and ectodermal placodes at post-neurula stages, surprisingly little is known about how these
populations become distinct from one another within the early neural plate border. Based on our preliminary
data, we hypothesize that many neural plate border cells are multipotent as evidenced by their
concomitant expression of markers characteristic of several fates. We will test this hypothesis by: 1)
conducting a detailed analysis of the emerging neural plate border region by multiplex protein and gene
expression profiling coupled with cell lineage analysis and 2) examining how perturbation of transcription factor
levels affects expression profiles and lineage allocations of individual neural plate border cells. The significance
of this proposal is that it will be the first to test how and when ectodermal placode precursors are segregated
from neural crest and neural precursors at the neural plate border. The following aims will be performed:
Aim 1: High resolution analysis of protein expression of neural plate, neural crest, placode and other
 ectodermal markers in the neural plate border as a function of time. We will examine co-expression of
 transcription factors associated with neural crest, placode, neural plate and ectodermal lineages
 quantitatively and at single cell resolution in chick gastrula to neurula stages to determine their degree of
 overlap and if/when a discrete separation occurs between them in the neural plate border. To take this to a
 multiplex level, we will then perform single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis (smFISH) at
 similar stages with 35 or more probes selected from known genes and new candidates from our single cell
 RNA-seq dataset.
Aim 2: Molecular dissection of regulatory interactions that mediate gene expression and cell fate
 choice at the neural plate border. We will examine the consequence of perturbing individual transcription
 factors (e.g. Pax7, Sox2, Six1) on expression of others neural plate border genes at the population and
 single cell level. To examine inputs that regulate neural plate border formation, we will dissect novel
 enhancers for Pax7, Six1 and other genes to determine direct regulatory inputs. Finally, we will examine
 how balancing levels of transcription factors may influence other factors in the neural plate border region.
Aim 3: Single cell lineage analysis of cells at the neural plate border. To definitively test whether
 individual cells at the neural plate border have restricted or broad developmental potential, we will carry out
 single cell lineage analysis by performing iontophoretic injection of lysinated rhodamine dextran into
 individual neural plate border cells. We also will use enhancers for Pax7, Sox2, or Six1 as well as
 photoconversion of individual cells to follow the long term fate of neural plate border cells and examine how
 blocking individual transcription factors affects cell lineage allocation.

death worldwide. However, the mechanisms that regulate the stability of late stage atherosclerotic lesions remain
poorly understood. Recent studies from our lab (2021 Nature Metabolism) showed that smooth muscle cell (SMC)
conditional knockout (KO) of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor- (PDGFR) in ApoE-/- mice was associated
with nearly complete failure of SMC to invest into lesions or the fibrous cap. However, despite nearly complete
absence of SMC in lesions of SMC PDGFR KO mice, surprisingly we observed no changes in lesion size or indices
of plaque stability, including the thickness of the ACTA2+ fibrous cap, following 18 weeks of Western diet (WD).
Further studies showed that: 1) contrary to dogma that Acta2+ fibrous cap cells are derived almost exclusively from
SMC, we found they account for only 60-75% of ACTA2+ cells in advanced ApoE-/- brachiocephalic (BCA) or human
coronary artery (CA) lesions with the remainder coming from endothelial cell (EC)-to-mesenchymal-to-myofibroblast
transitions (EndoMT-MFT, 15-20%) and macrophage-to-myofibroblast transitions (MMFT, 10-15%); 2) loss of SMC
investment into lesions with SMC PDGFR KO or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was associated with a 2-3 fold
increase in EndoMT-MFT and MMFT; 3) increased EndoMT-MFT, and MMFT did not sustain indices of stability when
WD feeding was extended to 26 weeks suggesting qualitative differences in the ability of fibrous cap cells to sustain
lesion stability depending on their origin; 4) the contribution of EC to the ACTA2+ fibrous cap increased with lesion
regression by feeding mice 18 weeks of WD followed by 12 weeks of chow diet; and 5) female but not male mice
exhibit IL1R1-dependent EndoMT. Studies herein will test the hypothesis that the contribution of EC to the ACTA2+
fibrous cap increases with lethal irradiation-BMT, SMC PDGFR KO, aging, female sex, and/or plaque regression
resulting in: 1) increased EC proliferation and replicative senescence; 2) loss of EC integrity and/or reduced anti-
thrombotic properties; and 3) increased susceptibility to plaque erosion or rupture. Aim 1 will determine if the marked
increase in the contribution of EndoMT-MFT to the ACTA2+ fibrous cap following lethal irradiation-BMT, SMC
PDGFR KO, or with plaque regression is associated with increased proliferation, clonal expansion, replicative
senescence, and/or dysfunction of EC. Aim 2 will determine if treatment of our SMC- or EC-lineage tracing ApoE-/-
or our novel Myh11-CreERT2/Rosa-eYFP/SR-BICT/CT/LDLR- (CT) mice with advanced BCA and CA lesions with
senolytic drugs is associated with beneficial changes in indices of plaque stability, improved survival, reduced MI or
stroke, reduced dependence on EndoMT-MFT for maintenance of the ACTA2+ fibrous cap, and/or improved EC
integrity and/or function. All aims include human validation studies on stable versus high risk carotid endarterectomy
samples, and assessment of sex-dependent determinants of late-stage lesion pathogenesis. The proposed studies

Neural crest and ectodermal placode cells are both transient embryonic progenitor cells that
arise from the neural plate border. They then either invaginate or undergo an epithelial to
mesenchymal transition, undergo reshaping or migration and differentiate into various
derivatives ranging from ganglia and sensory organs of the peripheral nervous system to (in the
case of neural crest) bone and cartilage of the face, cornea of the eye to pigmentation of the
body. About 10% of human birth defects, such as CHARGE or DiGeorge syndromes or
Hirschprung's disease, affect early neural crest or placode development. However, the
molecular mechanisms underlying these defects are largely unknown. Several cancers also
originate from the neural crest including the peripheral nervous system derived neuroblastoma,
the most common malignancy of infancy, as well as melanoma, pheocromocytoma and other
endocrine tumor types. The proposed experiments promise to illuminate the molecular and
cellular processes that result in early formation of neural crest and ectodermal placode cells and
their derivatives. The results of this study may inform upon diagnosis, therapeutic intervention
and also yield approaches guiding maintenance of neural crest and placodal stem cells for the

 In the early embryo, the neural plate border region contributes to diverse cell fates, ranging from neural
crest cells and ectodermal placode cells to neurons of the central nervous system. Despite extensive studies of
the neural crest and ectodermal placodes at post-neurula stages, surprisingly little is known about how these
populations become distinct from one another within the early neural plate border. Based on our preliminary
data, we hypothesize that many neural plate border cells are multipotent as evidenced by their
concomitant expression of markers characteristic of several fates. We will test this hypothesis by: 1)
conducting a detailed analysis of the emerging neural plate border region by multiplex protein and gene
expression profiling coupled with cell lineage analysis and 2) examining how perturbation of transcription factor
levels affects expression profiles and lineage allocations of individual neural plate border cells. The significance

A complication of preterm birth is underdeveloped lungs that lack surfactant and adequate gas
exchange due to immature alveoli. Although recent advances have been made, the process of
alveolar maturation is not well understood. A goal of this project is to understand signaling
from mesenchymal cells that direct alveologenesis, the final stage of lung development. We
have found that disruption of a specialized fibroblast, the lipofibroblast, results in reduced type
II alveolar cell differentiation. Type II alveolar cells are responsible for surfactant production,
and we will investigate the communication between lipofibroblasts and alveolar cells during lung
development in the mouse. The lipofibroblast has been a difficult cell to identify, and little is
known about the function of these cells. Our preliminary data demonstrate that a transcription
factor is required for the development of lipofibroblasts and alveolar differentiation. Based upon
these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that lipofibroblasts are required for the later steps of
lung development and that they secrete growth factors that are required specifically for terminal
differentiation of type II alveolar cells. We will investigate these cellular interactions in two
specific aims. In specific aim I, we will determine how lipofibroblasts impact alveolar
differentiation by examining the temporal requirement for lipofibroblasts and by evaluating
postnatal lung development in mice lacking lipofibroblasts. In Specific Aim II we will use in
vitro organoid culture and gene expression profiling to explore the lipofibroblast cellular signals
that direct type II alveolar differentiation. Together these aims will define the role of the
lipofibroblast and potentially identify therapeutic targets for increasing the rate of type II alveolar
differentiation in preterm births.","209925",

stiffness can induce a malignant phenotype in cultured human mammary organoids, suggesting that
mechanical properties of extracellular matrix directly regulate tumor metastasis. However, how mechanical

Our preliminary studies found that rigid matrix stiffness activates a novel mechanotransduction pathway to
induce Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and promote tumor metastasis. We therefore hypothesize
that mechanical forces activates the LYN kinase to allow the EMT-inducing transcription factor TWIST1 to
promote tumor invasion and metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we plan to 1) To elucidate the molecular
mechanism by which high tissue stiffness activates a novel mechanotransduction cascade to promote TWIST1
nuclear translocation and EMT; 2) To elucidate the novel molecular mechanism by which soft matrix stiffness

Self-renewing, multipotent hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are essential for the foundation and
lifetime maintenance of the adult blood system. Definitive HSPCs are born during embryonic development when a
subset of vascular endothelial cells (ECs), called hemogenic endothelium (hemECs), acquire hematopoietic
potential and give rise to HSPC that bud from the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta. Unfortunately, the regulators
of hemogenic endothelial cell specification and HSPC formation from endothelium are largely undefined.
Recently, we identified miR-223 as novel regulator of hemogenic endothelial cells in zebrafish. Zebrafish and
mice miR-223 mutant embryos had an increased number hemogenic endothelial cells, resulting in mature HSPC
expansion from the onset and into later stages of hematopoiesis. While our studies establish miR-223 as a novel
regulatory factor of hemogenic endothelial cell development and HSPC generation, the specific cellular events
and direct molecular targets regulated by miR-223 in these processes remain unknown. Transcriptome analysis
of wild type and miR-223 mutant endothelial cells from zebrafish and mouse embryos, at stages when definitive
hematopoiesis is occurring, revealed that miR-223 target-genes were enriched for genes relating to protein N-
glycosylation. Interestingly, miRNAs are known to target glycosylation enzymes in processes analogous to EHT,
such as endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and cancer metastasis. However, whether miRNA-dependent
glycosylation regulation extends to EHT and HSPC induction remains uninvestigated. Here, we will test the
hypothesis that miR-223 fine tunes N-glycosylation levels to control endothelial to hematopoietic cell fate
transition.","623036",

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a pulmonary vascular disease characterized by pulmonary vascular remodeling,
and death. One of the most common forms of PH is secondary to interstitial lung disease (group 3.2) with a
prevalence of about 30-40% in patients with pulmonary fibrosis (PF). PH development secondary to PF increases
mortality about 3-fold as the combined disease is refractory to most therapies. The lack of effective therapies
can be attributed, at least in part, to the lack of a relevant pre-clinical model of PF-PH. We have developed a
novel pre-clinical rat model of combined PF-PH that recapitulates most of the pathophysiologic findings seen in
patients with PF-PH. We have also identified a novel microRNA, miR125b-3p (miR125b), which is preferentially
and significantly upregulated in the lungs of rats and humans with combined PF-PH compared to PF alone.
miR125 upregulation is associated with significant downregulation of its target TNFAIP3 leading to increased
expression of Slug, a transcription factor responsible for promoting endothelial to mesenchymal transition
(EndMT). Our preliminary data shows overexpression of miR125b in the lungs of rat with pre-existing PF is
sufficient to induce PH and to promote EndMT in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) in vitro.
The goal of this proposal is to determine how miR125 induces pulmonary vascular remodeling and EndMT to
promote PH in pre-existing PF and to investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting miR125 and Snai2 in
preventing PH in pre-existing PF. Our central hypotheses are: 1) marked increase of miR125b in the lungs
promotes transition of PF to PF-PH by decreasing the expression of its target TNFAIP3 resulting in Snai2
upregulation that stimulates EndMT leading to worsening pulmonary vascular remodeling; and 2) Knock-down
of miR125b and/or Slug in the lungs of rats with pre-existing PF prevents transition from PF to PF-PH. Aim 1 will
gain mechanistic insights into the role of miR125b/Slug axis in promoting PH by driving vascular remodeling in
rats/patients with pre-existing PF; Aim 2 will gain mechanistic insights into the role of miR125b/Slug axis in
promoting PH by driving EndMT in rats/patients with pre-existing PF; and Aim 3 will examine whether miR125b
and/or Slug can serve as novel therapeutic targets to prevent the transition of PF to PF-PH. The proposed studies

 Lymphocytes within lymphoid tissues are regulated by a vascular-stromal compartment comprised of blood
vessels, lymphatic sinuses, and non-vascular mesenchymal reticular cells, and understanding the functions
and regulation of this compartment can have implications for better understanding and treating
lymphoproliferative and autoimmune diseases. We have recently shown that fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs)
are in distinct functional states at homeostasis and in inflamed lymph nodes. Our long-term goal is to
understand other functional features of the vascular-stromal compartment in inflamed nodes, how these
features contribute to regulating immune responses, and how these features in inflamed nodes are induced.
Here, we show that FRCs upregulate CCL2 during a phase of the immune response that corresponds to
plasma cell accumulation. FRCs express CCL2 at high levels in the vascular-rich medulla and vascular-rich
regions of the T zone, which are also the sites of plasma cell localization. We show that CCL2 limits plasma
cell survival and that vascular permeability may play a role in inducing the FRC functional phenotype in these
vascular-rich regions. We propose to test the hypothesis that, during this phase of the immune response,
features of vascular-rich microenvironments regulate plasma cell function and vascular activity regulates FRC
functional phenotype in these areas. Our aims are 1) to understand how CCL2 regulates plasma cell survival
and 2) to understand how vascular activity contributes to modulating FRC functional phenotype. The results
from this proposal will provide new insights into lymphoid tissue vascular-stromal function and regulation,
plasma cell regulation, and a potential link between cardiovascular health and the immune system. This link is
especially relevant for autoimmune diseases such as lupus that are characterized both by vascular dysfunction
and immune system dysfunction marked in part by plasma cell accumulation","440000",

Vascular calcification (VC) frequently complicates cardiovascular disease. It increases the morbidity and
mortality and constitutes a significant obstacle in interventions and surgeries. The vascular endothelium plays
an important role in VC. The intimal (luminal) endothelial cells (ECs) contribute to VC by providing
osteoprogenitor cells through endothelial-mesenchymal transitions (EndMTs). The adventitial ECs are known
to contribute to neo-angiogenesis in diseased vascular wall, but it is unknown whether such ECs support VC
and what defines them. A subset of ECs with high expression of the EC marker CD31 and the glycoprotein
Endomucin (Emcn) has been found in bone to support bone formation. It is possible that adventitial or other
peripheral ECs are recruited to diseased areas to promote calcification. Preliminary experiments, using the
Matrix Gla Protein null (Mgp-/-) mouse as a VC model, showed extensive EC involvement in the calcified aorta.
We identified two subtypes of ECs in the adventitial vs. the intimal endothelium (referred to as a-ECs and i-
ECs). The a-ECs were CD31+Emcm+ and correlated with the severity of the VC, whereas the i-ECs were
CD31+Emcn-. The two ECs had distinct transcriptional profiles with stem cell and osteogenic markers in the i-
ECs vs. enhanced Notch expression in the a-ECs. Endothelial deletion of Notch1 reduced the a-ECs and
limited VC while promoting cartilage formation and survival in the Mgp-/- mice. The bone transcription factor
Osterix was expressed in both types of ECs. We hypothesize that a-ECs are distinct from i-ECs, recruited to
nascent VC, and susceptible to Notch disruption. We also hypothesize that Osterix is protective of EC lineage.
In Aim 1, we will characterize the a-ECs (CD31+Emcn+) and compare to the i-ECs (CD31+Emcn-) in the Mgp-/-
model, and correlate with severity of VC and marker expression. We will identify unique markers for the
respective ECs, with comparison to bone, using transcriptional profiles from single cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq). We will test the concept that angiogenesis is required for VC using angiogenic inhibitors. In Aim
2, we will determine the effect of loss or gain of endothelial Notch signaling on the EC subtypes and VC. We
will examine the distribution of Notch components in relation to VC, and generate Mgp-/- mice with endothelial-
specific loss of Notch1 or the Notch receptor inactivator Fbxw7. We will use the mice to determine the effect on
the appearance of the endothelial subtypes, calcification and transcriptional profiles by scRNAseq. We will also
apply loss and gain of Notch to ECs in vitro and identify novel Notch targets and networks. In Aim 3, we will
determine if Osterix helps maintain EC lineage or promotes calcification in vitro and in vivo using human aortic
ECs and inducible endothelial-specific Osterix gene deletion in Mgp-/- mice. We will compare the transcriptional
profiles of ECs with and without Osterix by scRNAseq in order to clarify the effect on EC lineage, a-ECs vc. I-
ECs, and involved signaling networks. Our results may have a significant impact on the field of VC, in
particular on the understanding of the endothelial pathology and involvement in VC.","540935",

 Ischemic diseases, including critical limb ischemia and myocardial infarction, afflict millions of people in the
United States. Currently, these diseases are predominately treated by surgical interventions. However, the
inability to regenerate microvascular beds in ischemic tissues remains a challenge. Alternatively, the
development of therapies based on transplanting endothelial cells (ECs) continues to be a priority in vascular
medicine. Unfortunately, engrafting ECs is not trivial. Studies have repeatedly shown that in order to achieve
significant engraftment resulting in functional new blood vessels, ECs require co-transplantation with supporting
cells such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). However, this paradigm is problematic because it increases
the complexity of clinical trials exponentially. Previously, we have published extensively on all aspects of human
EC+MSC engraftment. However, the underlying mechanisms by which MSCs facilitate EC engraftment remain
incompletely understood. Recently, we found that upon implantation, MSCs transfer mitochondria to ECs via
tunneling nanotubes and that when this transfer was genetically abrogated, EC engraftment was drastically
impaired. Based on this insight, we propose a new concept: artificially transplanting mitochondria into human
ECs as a means to preemptively enhance their ability to engraft without a secondary cell type. Indeed, our
preliminary data show that transplanting exogenous mitochondria into ECs renders the cells (termed mitoT-ECs)
capable of forming functional vessels in vivo in ischemic tissues, without the support of MSCs. We also found
that transplanted mitochondria co-localized with LC3B-marked autophagosomes and that genetic ablation of
PINK1 and Parkin (both central players in mitophagy) eliminated the enhanced engraftment ability of mitoT-ECs.
Together, our overarching hypothesis is that transplanting exogenous mitochondria into ECs renders transient
cytoprotection via mitophagy; this, in turn, enhances the engraftment ability of the cells. To test this hypothesis
and to determine the efficacy of mitoT-ECs to treat ischemic diseases, we propose two specific aims. In Aim-1,
we will determine conditions (e.g., concentration and timing) for optimal EC engraftment in immunodeficient mice.
We will dissect the role of mitophagy and will examine the fate and persistence of the transplanted mitochondria.
We will also determine if selective drugs with mitophagy-enhancing properties could also enhance EC
engraftment. In Aim-2, we will determine the efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation-enabled EC therapy in two
well-established models of ischemic diseases: critical hind limb ischemia (in mice) and myocardial
ischemia/reperfusion injury (in rats). In summary, we propose studies to develop a novel approach to engraft
ECs more successfully. We envision this research could become the basis for a new strategy in vascular cell
therapies.","480031",

they are to provide health benefits to society. However, engineered skin substitute (ESS) only fulfills basic skin
functions and fails to match the structural and biophysical characteristics of the human skin, such as missing
hair follicle and sweat gland, limiting its use in vivo. Their absences are due to a lack of functioning cell types
that instruct human keratinocytes in ESS to make a hair follicle and a lack of an in-depth understanding of
essential epithelial-mesenchymal interactions that drive hair follicle formation. In the case of hair follicle
engineering, the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions between keratinocytes and their immediate dermal
environment need to be precisely modulated to govern hair follicle lineage commitment. The major cell type that
constitutes a unique dermal “niche” is a specialized population of fibroblasts, which are located at the base of
the hair follicle, called the dermal papilla (DP), and are different from normal human dermal fibroblasts. However,
it is of great difficulty to isolate and expand human DP fibroblasts in vitro while maintaining their inductive capacity
for tissue engineering purposes. The long-term goal is to develop novel bioengineering approaches to produce
a fully functional human skin equivalent with normal microanatomy. The central hypothesis is that hair follicle
induction is an emergent property of skin constructs, which requires the interplay of multiple signals and cell
types in an inductive microenvironment. The objectives are to systemically explore how to create an inductive
microenvironment in ESS to induce hair follicle formation. To achieve this, we have devised a three-pronged
strategy addressing hair follicle bioengineering in ESS: 1) mimic the original niche by fabricating composite
keratinocyte-DP cell spheroids in micropatterned ESS; 2) enhance intercellular interactions by adding BMP6 and
3) drive the DP phenotype by re-activating master transcription factors. In the first aim, we will determine if multi-
cell type spheroids combined with premade hair canals can mimic a natural niche in ESS. We have developed
two 3D composite spheroid models and will determine whether they will allow DP fibroblasts to expand in vitro
while maintaining DP inductivity to induce hair follicles in a laser micropatterned skin substitute model. In the
second aim, we will determine the inductive functions of Bmp6 in stimulating hair follicle formation in ESS. We
will dissect the roles of Bmp6 in hair follicle formation and growth. In the third aim, we will determine whether
human DP fibroblasts can be reprogrammed to reestablish hair inductivity. We will assess whether in vitro genetic
reprogramming of human DP fibroblasts by CRISPRa-mediated expression of master transcription factors
promote the ability of composite keratinocyte-DP cell spheroids to induce hair follicles in ESS. This work will
provide novel mechanistic knowledge of spatial niche arrangement, inductive signals, and genetic programs that
is critical to promote hair follicle neogenesis in ESS. The outcomes are significant because it will accelerate hair
follicle bioengineering and advance complex in vitro and in vivo tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.","307729",

 Our lab has previously identified a mechanism of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-mediated
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in murine mammary epithelium. We have shown that expression of
the interleukin-like EMT inducer (ILEI) protein is necessary to induce EMT in murine mammary gland cells
following exposure to TGFβ. ILEI has also been shown to increase the self-renewal capacity of epithelial cells
following EMT, through its interaction with leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), suggesting that the
ILEI/LIFR signaling axis promotes breast cancer stem-cell (BCSC) phenotype. Further, our lab has shown that
TGFβ-induced upregulation of LIFR is ILEI-dependent. In cells derived from a mouse tumor progression model
created by our lab, spheroid formation capacity in non-adherent cell culture conditions is attenuated following
either ILEI or LIFR knockdown. Additionally, orthotopic grafts of cells with ILEI or LIFR knockdown display a
decrease in tumor growth and metastasis relative to control cells. We hypothesize that TGFβ-induced LIFR
regulation contributes to metastases.
 The precise mechanisms of ILEI-mediated EMT and BCSC induction are unknown. Herein we aim to
interrogate ILEI/LIFR axis-mediated mechanisms downstream of TGFβ exposure that influence (1) the regulation
of LIFR protein expression and (2) the ensuing maintenance of self-renewal capacity and disease progression
in our model. In Specific Aim 1, the LIFR promoter sequence will be examined to identify key factors regulating
LIFR expression. In Specific Aim 2, transcriptomic data will be examined following ILEI/LIFR knockout to identify
a signature of ILEI/LIFR-regulated gene expression and its association with self-renewal capacity. In Specific
Aim 3, the role of LIFR will be examined in vivo to determine the impact of its expression upon outgrowth of
pulmonary tumors following tail vein injection of cells into immunodeficient mice.
 Data from our experiments will characterize a signaling pathway associated with BCSC maintenance and
will potentially identify novel therapeutic targets. Our findings may translate to novel treatments for dormancy

Adipocytes develop from tissue-resident progenitor cells that differentiate in response to environmental stimuli. Impairments in adipocyte differentiation, caused by genetic disease, aging or obesity, lead to adipose fibrosis and insulin resistance. Conversely, enhancing adipogenesis ameliorates lipodystrophy- and obesity-related diabetes. However, there is relatively little known about the identity, activity and regulation of adipose precursor cells in vivo. To identify adipose progenitor cells in a completely unbiased manner, we performed single cell RNA-sequencing of the stromal-vascular fraction from white adipose tissue. Clustering analysis of the gene expression data from >12, 000 cells/study identified many distinct cell populations. This included two distinct types of putative adipogenic precursor cells, which we conditionally called “early adipose progenitors” and “committed preadipocytes” based on their gene signatures. “Early progenitors”, marked by cell surface expression of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), are enriched for expression of genes in the Wnt and Tgf signaling pathways. “Committed preadipocytes” are marked by cell surface expression of Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) and were noted for their selective expression of many adipose lineage markers, including Ppar. In silico cell trajectory analysis predicts that early DPP4+ progenitors give rise to ICAM1+ preadipocytes as well as another “novel” cell type. Consistent with this, preliminary transplantation studies show that DPP4+ progenitor cells produce ICAM1+ cells as well as mature adipocytes in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that DPP4+ early progenitor cells give rise to adipose-lineage committed ICAM1+ preadipocytes under adipogenic conditions. We additionally hypothesize that Wnt signaling controls the fate and proliferative activity of early adipogenic progenitors and that these cells lose their adipogenic activity and adopt a myofibroblast fate during the aging process. We will rigorously examine these new concepts and hypotheses using state-of-the-art approaches, including cell transplantation, genetic lineage tracing, and single cell transcriptomic analyses. Specific Aim 1 uses mesenchymal differentiation assays in culture, cell transplantation and genetic lineage tracing analysis to examine the fate, proliferation and hierarchical relationship between Wnt2/DPP4+ and ICAM1+ cells. Specific Aim 2 investigates the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in regulating the maintenance and activity of Wnt2/DPP4+ early progenitors in vitro and in vivo. Together, these studies will define the hierarchy of adipose progenitor cells in WAT, determine the contribution of early progenitors to white and beige adipocyte development and assess the effects of aging on adipose progenitor function.","493393",

 Biological tissues appear to “know” their intended final sizes and achieve them precisely and robustly. While,
in principle, a simple negative signaling feedback should be sufficient to explain how a given stem cell lineage
regulates its cellular outputs, in reality it cannot work because most tissues are physically large, with stem cells
and their progeny spread out over centimeter-scale distances. How tissues overcome the microscopic decay
limits of diffusible molecular signals to breach distances orders-of-magnitude in spatial scale remains elusive.
 This application is inspired by our serendipitous discovery that FGF and BMP mutant mice are able to grow
super-long and highly imprecise hairs that can exceed the length of normal mouse hairs by 7-fold. Our lineage
analyses suggest that hair stem cells continuously replenish short-lived transit-amplifying (TA) cells spatially
located nearly 1 cm away from the stem cells. Interestingly, our single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses reveal
previously unappreciated heterogeneity of the intermediate epithelial progenitor cells physically located between
the stem and TA cells.
 Through an integrated mathematical and experimental approach, this application will focus on testing
our new hypothesis that dynamic equilibrium between two or more intermediate cell states and their associated
cell-cell communications enable feedback information propagation over large spatial scale from TA cells to stem
cells to regulate the new progenitor cell production for hair size control. The first aim of the proposed research
is to profile and quantify the heterogeneity of intermediate epithelial progenitors, and computationally and
experimentally determine the functional link between specific intermediate progenitor states in the hair follicle
and the hair length and its precision. The second aim is to define the cell-cell communication networks within the
epithelial hair follicle lineage, and computationally and experimentally establish how multiple short-range
signaling activities coordinate to form a long-range feedback mechanism that controls progenitor flux between
distant stem and TA cell compartments for proper hair growth. The third aim is to determine the signaling impact
of mesenchymal niche cells, which surround the hair follicle, on the epithelial lineage cells for hair size control.
 The study premise is based on novel and extensive preliminary experimental and computational data. The
proposed studies are significant because they will establish new long-range signaling mechanisms and
uncover novel roles of intermediate cell states in tissue size control. The proposed studies are innovative
because they will establish new experimental models for studying tissue size regulation using super-long and
extra-short hair mutant mice and will result in numerous new genetic mouse tools for epithelial stem cell research.
They will also result in several novel mathematical and computational tools for analyzing single-cell RNA-
sequencing data and new spatial models for complex cell lineages, such as in the hair follicle.","546851",

Adult tooth loss is an undesirable consequence of dental disease or injury that affects a majority of Americans.
Thus, it has become the aim and challenge of bioengineers and regenerative medicine scientists to understand
the fundamental principles by which native tissue structures grow and form, and apply this knowledge to recreate
oral structures.1 A better understanding of how embryonic teeth develop, especially at early stages of tooth
formation (placode organization and initiation of epithelial invagination), is paramount. The primary goal of this
proposal is to understand the mechanisms behind the development of embryonic mouse incisor tooth germs.
While the process by which biochemical signaling initiates placode formation and position is well described,2
much less is known about how spatiotemporal patterns of physical cues, such as cell-generated forces and tissue
elastic properties, influence tooth germ invagination.
Hypothesis: Spatially-defined differences in cell tension and tissue stiffness (on the order of tens of microns)
drive the epithelial invagination process. The main innovation of this project will be the cutting edge mechanical
measurement techniques that I will develop and apply to functionally understand mechanical contributions to
tooth germ formation. I will first determine the functional role of epithelial force generation in driving epithelial
invagination. Second, I will determine the mesenchyme mechanical contribution on epithelial invagination. And
third, I will create an in vitro model of the mouse mandible at the incisor region to examine the interplay between
mechanical and soluble chemical cues on epithelial invagination. Accomplishing these aims will allow me to
ascertain the mechanics of the developing tooth germ, how mechanical properties of the germ affect and are
affected by signaling pathways, and how this interplay contributes to the invagination process. Altogether, these
experiments will lay the groundwork to develop regenerative medicine and tissue engineering strategies to grow
a functional tooth.
This fellowship training plan and the environment in which the research training will take place will foster my
growth as a young scientist, and career path as an independent investigator. I intend to develop my skills in
fundamental and molecular biology. Coming from the chemical and physical sciences, this fellowship experience
will allow me to immerse myself in a new environment with people whose skillset is very different than my own.
I will forge a new, multidisciplinary research direction and expand my unique research toolbox. I believe this
opportunity will best allow me to study the interface between biology and solid mechanics. This combination of
institute, sponsors, and project will enhance my training as an independent researcher and field leader in cross-
sector investigations.","66794",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is associated with high morbidity and mortality in children and
adults. Despite years of research, pharmacologic treatment has proven ineffective in decreasing mortality and
morbidity which is likely due, in part, to heterogeneity in ARDS patients. Latent class analyses (LCA) of data
from multiple large funded adult studies have identified two ARDS endotypes (subphenotypes) with differing
clinical outcomes and response to treatment. There are no studies examining whether endotypes exist in
pediatric ARDS (PARDS). However, by examining genome-wide gene expression in whole blood, endotypes
have been identified in children with septic shock, another condition with a high degree of patient heterogeneity
which involves dysregulation of the inflammatory/immune systems. The endotypes identified using this
transcriptomic approach have differing risks of mortality and expression of immune inflammatory genes.
Transcriptomics have not yet been used to define subgroups of adult or pediatric patients with ARDS.
 The PROSpect trial (UG3 HL141736) is an unprecedented opportunity to use biological samples from
children with PARDS to answer several high impact questions related to PARDS heterogeneity. Our central
hypothesis is that there are endotypes in children with PARDS which differ in their underlying pathophysiology
and responsiveness to therapies. The goal of this proposal is to a) identify and characterize endotypes in
children with PARDS using both LCA (Sp Aim 1) and gene expression profiling (Sp Aim 2) approaches, b)
determine whether subgroups differ in outcome and/or response to treatment, and c) identify potential
pathways involved in differences between endotype outcomes and response to treatment (Sp Aim 3). This
proposal addresses one of the objectives in the strategic vision of the NHLBI, “Identifying factors that account
for individual differences in pathobiology and responses to treatment”. Our Specific Aims will test the
hypotheses that: 1) LCA will identify two endotypes in children with PARDS, and that outcomes, and
response to treatment, will vary between endotypes; 2) The two endotypes distinguished by the
expression of 100 genes in children with septic shock also exist in children with PARDS, that de novo
genome-wide expression profiling will identify additional endotypes in children with PARDS and, that
outcomes and response to treatment will vary between transcriptomic endotypes identified using each
approach; 3) Combining the results of the LCA with data on gene expression used for identification of
transcriptomic endotypes will allow further stratification of patients with PARDS, and will reveal a
subset of genes that are related to differential outcomes and response to treatment. This proposal will
lay the fundamental groundwork for future precision care of PARDS patients by identifying: different endotypes
within PARDS, differences in the underlying pathophysiology of PARDS endotypes, whether endotypes
respond differently to treatment, and how endotypes of pediatric sepsis and PARDS relate to each other.","674283",

The respiratory system is comprised of multiple unique and spatially distinct compartments that respond to
injury and diseases states differently based on their cellular and extracellular composition. The alveolar
compartment or niche is responsible for the majority of gas exchange with the external environment in the
lungs and is an area that is dramatically altered during lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Within the alveolus, there are at least two major
mature epithelial cell types, alveolar type 1 (AT1) and alveolar type 2 cells (AT2), as well as various
mesenchymal cells including Pdgfra+/Axin2+ mesenchymal alveolar niche cells (MANCs), Axin2+
myofibroblast precursor cells (AMPs), and poorly defined vascular endothelial cell populations. Despite our
increasing knowledge of the cell types that comprise the lung alveolus, we have little information on how they
communicate with each other or how their progenitor-differentiated progeny relationships are ultimately
regulated. To address these questions, we propose to characterize the genetic pathways of the mature adult
lung to better understand the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms underlying lung homeostasis and
regeneration. Our preliminary data has identified two new and important transcriptional regulators of alveolar
epithelial homeostasis and regeneration: Tfcp2l1 and Klf5. Our preliminary data suggest that Tfcp2l1 and Klf5
regulate the self-renewal of AEP and AT2 cells and their differentiation into AT1 cells, in opposing manners.
Tfcp2l1 is essential in restricting AT2 differentiation into the AT1 lineage whereas Klf5 is essential for licensing
the ability of AT2 cells to differentiate into AT1 cells after acute injury. Moreover, our preliminary data suggests
that Tfcp2l1 marks the AEP sublineage in a manner similar to how Lgr5 marks the intestinal stem cell.
Together, these data provide critical insight into the molecular and cellular orchestration of alveolar
homeostasis and regeneration through the engagement of cell type specific transcriptional pathways that
regulate self-renewal and differentiation of epithelial cell lineages.","513633",

 Cytokinetic abscission, the final stage of cell division, is a complex process that requires the assembly
of proteins in a sequential fashion to successfully sever the intercellular bridge that connects the two daughter
cells. Abscission failure generates multinucleated cells, which are observed in normal tissues, such as human
epidermis, myoblasts, and the terminal epithelium of a lactating mammary gland, as well as in several human
tumors, including those of the breast. Multinucleated cells that continue to divide will lead to aneuploidy, a sign
of chromosomal instability, underlining the importance of understanding how microenvironmental conditions
lead to abscission failure and multinucleation. We recently found that mammary epithelial cells induced to
undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) on stiff microenvironments, similar to what is found at the
terminal ends of a normal mammary gland or in breast tumors, fail to complete cytokinesis, resulting in
multinucleated cells. EMT signaling through Snail leads to an increase in the expression of septin-6, a filament-
forming GTPase that is recruited to the intercellular bridge, specifically the midbody, during cytokinesis. Cells
cultured on soft substrata do not upregulate septin-6 expression, fail to undergo EMT, and are able to undergo
normal abscission. I therefore hypothesize that ECM stiffness along with EMT signaling affects the ability of
Snail to bind to the promoter of septin-6 and affects the balance of factors required for normal abscission. I will
use synthetic microenvironments combined with assays to measure protein-DNA interactions as well as
imaging techniques to understand how Snail and the microenvironment disrupt abscission. In Specific Aim 1, I
will use chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, promoter-reporter assays, and sequencing (ChIP-seq
and RNA-seq) to determine how Snail and stiffness synergistically regulate expression of septin-6 in mammary
epithelial cells. In Specific Aim 2, I will combine synthetic substrata with quantitative imaging and timelapse
analysis to determine the mechanism by which stiff microenvironments and Snail alter abscission. Successfully
completing these aims will deepen our understanding of how the microenvironment regulates abscission
failure, which will provide additional insight into the process of cytokinesis and may also suggest therapeutic
targets for diseases associated with multinucleation. At the same time, this research plan synergizes with my
training plan within a multi-institutional MD/PhD environment, which will strengthen my understanding of
quantitative cell and molecular biology, as well as how this field informs and is informed by clinical practice in
internal medicine.","45688",

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most mutagenic and cytotoxic insults to the genome. DSBs are
repaired through homology directed recombination (HDR), which is predominant in S and G2 phases, and also
by error prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which is active in all cell cycle phases. In cancer cells,
heightened activity of these repair pathways has been linked to radioresistance. The transcriptional repressor
ZEB1 is a well-established driver of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in both normal
development and tumor progression. Recent studies suggest that ZEB1 plays new roles in the regulation of the
DNA damage response (DDR), via enhancing the stability of the checkpoint kinase CHK1, and in regulating the
repair of DSBs through the transcriptional silencing of polymerase theta, a major driver of microhomology-
mediated alternative NHEJ (alt-NHEJ). We have discovered that ZEB1 is rapidly recruited to DSBs induced
selectively in euchromatic genomic regions in a DNA-PK-dependent manner, and is essential for the
recruitment 53BP1 to these sites. The recruitment of ZEB1 to these break sites was associated with local
chromatin modifications permissive for NHEJ repair. Consequently, depletion or deletion of ZEB1 suppressed
canonical NHEJ in cell-based DSB repair assays, and significantly increased both DSB-associated hyper-
resection and HDR, This correlated with ATM-independent increases in chromosomal aberrations and
enhanced sensitivity to IR. On the other hand, loss of ZEB1 was associated with decreased sensitivity of
BRCA-deficient cells to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), indicative of restoration of HDR in these cell population,
presumably through inhibiting 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs and stimulation of hyper-resection. Importantly, we
found that ZEB1-dependent recruitment of 53BP1 to DSB is significantly amplified in hypoxia. Based on these
novel observations, we hypothesize that ZEB1 promotes DSB repair via both direct and indirect mechanisms
and this is critical for promoting therapeutic resistance to IR and for conferring sensitivity of BRCA-deficient
cells to PARPi; on one hand, ZEB1 directly promotes c-NHEJ through the recruitment of the anti-resection and
c-NHEJ repair protein 53BP1 to euchromatin-bound DSBs. On the other hand, ZEB1 facilitates the repair of
DSBs through augmenting the DDR and through indirectly enhancing c-NHEJ repair through its chromatin-
modifying as well as transcriptional silencing activity. Aim 1 of this proposal focuses on understanding the
mechanism(s) by which ZEB1 regulates DSB repair. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of ZEB1 on the
therapeutic response of breast cancer to IR and PARP inhibitors in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and in

Cleft palate is one of the most common birth defects, requiring significant surgical, medical, and psychosocial
intervention. Normal palate development is mediated by multiple signaling pathways and hundreds of genes,
and their perturbation by genetic or environmental insult leads to cleft palate. This project will apply gene
expression and predictive, multiscale network analyses to gain insight into palate development and the

ameliorate or prevent abnormal palatogenesis.","NIDCR","10314049","12/10/2021 12:00:00 AM","PA-19-056","5R01DE029322-03","5","R01","DE","029322","03"," ","STEIN, KATHRYN K","1/1/2020 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2024 12:00:00 AM","Genetics of Health and Disease Study Section[GHD]"," ","1872428","JABS, ETHYLIN WANG","VAN BAKEL, HARM ","13","GENETICS","078861598","C8H9CNG1VBD9","078861598","C8H9CNG1VBD9","US","40.790525","-73.953788","3839801","ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","100296574","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2022 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2022 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2022"," "," ","NIDCR","407817","283432"," ","ABSTRACT
Cleft palate is one of the most common structural birth defects. Surgical correction and medical and psychosocial
care impose significant personal and societal burdens. Increased understanding of the etiology of cleft palate
potentially will lead to improvements in diagnosis and treatment. Palatogenesis is enormously complex. Paired
palatal shelves first extend vertically from the maxillary processes and must grow sufficiently so that upon
horizontal elevation their medial edges come into contact. Epithelia covering the medial shelves disintegrate,
allowing their fusion. Key processes involved include epithelial/mesenchymal interactions and transitions.
Studies in humans and mice have identified at least 429 genes associated with oral clefting. Reductionist
scientific approaches have provided detail about individual genes and pathways in palatogenesis, but the intuitive
models generated are not sufficient to represent the enormous complexity of the process. We will employ
transcriptome and network analyses to understand how biological components work together to produce system-
wide outcomes of epithelial differentiation and adhesion, mesenchymal biomechanical properties affecting
remodeling and shelf elevation, and anterior/posterior regionalization of epithelia and mesenchyme. These
processes require the integration of multiple cross-regulating signaling pathways. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
and sonic hedgehog (SHH) are two such pathways, and their information is integrated with other pathways by
the transcription factor p63. We will generate bulk and single-cell RNA-seq libraries from the palatal shelves of
wild type mice to discover gene coexpression and regulatory networks, and specific cell populations involved in
normal palatogenesis. For bulk RNA-seq libraries we will separate anterior and posterior epithelial and
mesenchymal compartments allowing region-specific analysis of transcriptional changes. We will use the same
approach for four mutant mouse lines, exploiting these gene perturbations to identify key driver genes and
interacting pathways within these networks. We will study two activating FGFR2 mutations that exert their
differential effects from the epithelium or the mesenchyme (S252W or C342Y) and null mutations of SHH and
p63, expressed in the epithelium. Complementary bulk and single-cell RNA-seq libraries will identify differential
gene expression and novel key components and pathways critical to palatogenesis. We will use these datasets,
in conjunction with publicly available palate-related datasets to build high-resolution, multiscale molecular
networks that will be used to develop predictive, mechanistic models of palatogenesis. Novel molecular networks
and key regulators identified through the multiscale network modeling approach will be validated by in situ
hybridization, immunohistochemistry, palatal organ cultures, and mouse models. Our innovative approach to
generating comprehensive datasets, using advanced systems biology technologies, and building multiscale
network models of normal and abnormal palatogenesis will have a large impact on the clinical, craniofacial,
-omics, and developmental biology fields.","691249",

 Vascular health is essential to the normal regulation of cardiovascular function. That dysfunctions of blood
pressure regulation, such as hypertension, remain difficult to treat suggests that the scientific community does
not fully understand the mechanisms by which normal and pathological changes in blood pressure are achieved,
nor how the vasculature can both influence and be impacted by changes in blood pressure. This new Program
Project Grant is based on the overall hypothesis that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) has bidirectional
interactions with the other layers of a blood vessel and is a critical partner with these layers to form an integrated
system that maintains vascular health. Our collective preliminary work has led to the hypothesis that PVAT
and its primary components – the adipocyte and progenitor cells, the immune cells, and neuronal
innervation/neurohumoral control —are central integrators of overall vascular health/function. This grant
will enable foundational studies that are critical to understanding how the elements of PVAT work together, and
ultimately influence vascular tone. This grant is unique in that it will also interrogate how (patho)physiological
challenges (e.g. change in stretch, pressure) placed on a vessel affect PVAT function. Our studies will progress
to a model of high fat (HF)-diet induced hypertension, a situation of elevated vascular pressure and PVAT
burden. This work will use models that allow for the most rigorous experimentation: mice in nerve- and adipocyte
progenitor lineage-tracing; optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches; rats as a model organism for HF-diet
induced hypertension; pressure imposition through a novel mid-thoracic aortic coarcted model; novel
microscopic and bioinformatic work; and human vasculature + PVAT for translational potential. Our collective,
novel approach contrasts directly with the plethora of literature that investigates how the PVAT secretome
influences vascular function. We will determine, through projects supported by four cores (administrative,
animal, bioinformatic and microscopy), whether: 1) PVAT possesses the ability to mechanotransduce and has
significant stiffness that contributes to vascular stiffness; 2) PVAT is innervated or under neurohumoral control
with functional consequence; 3) whether the unique microenvironment of PVAT influences immune cell function;
and 4) how the fate of adipocyte progenitors is influenced by vascular stretch. Investigators are deeply
invested in the planning of, execution of and learning from experiments carried out in projects and cores
other than theirs; this work was purposefully developed in this way to be synergistic. This integrated
work advances human health by redefining the functional vessel, a redefinition that could have significant impact
on not only hypertension but all physiologies and dysfunctions which involve the vasculature.","2695451",

This project focus in the biology of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that are common aggressive
malignancies with a curability rate of 65% despite intensive chemoimmunotherapy. DLBCLs display an array of
genetic alterations, that define molecular subtypes, and strong dependence on the microenvironment for survival.
We hypothesize that reprogramming of the stromal microenvironment is critical for the oncogenicity of hallmark
mutations that mediate lymphoma progression and immune evasion. We propose to elucidate the roles of the
cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and extracellular matrix (ECM) components of the lymphoma
microenvironment to identify therapeutic vulnerabilities. CAFs are derived from healthy fibroblasts that have been
reprogrammed by cancer cells into a novel biological entity. Our long-term goal is to therapeutically exploit
reprogrammed CAFs with consideration of genetically-defined DLBCLs. For this reason, it is critical to elucidate
the mechanisms involved in CAF reprogramming. Not all CAFs are reprogrammed in the same way. Moreover,
rather than a terminal effect, CAF reprogramming as a transcriptionally dynamic process that allows the
establishment of a variety of adaptive phenotypes. Our preliminary data suggest the activation of “shared” and
“private” pathways in the reprogramming of CAFs. We specifically identify and studied the role of HSF1, one of
the “shared” transcription factors in CAFs. CAFs without HSF1 failed to produce an ECM with the biochemical
composition and mechanical properties required for lymphoma progression. Concomitantly, lack of HSF1 in the
TME allowed the establishment of an effective lymphoma immune response leading to tumor eradication. We
plan to test our central hypothesis and accomplish the objective of this application by pursuing these specific
aims: Aim 1. Elucidate mechanisms of CAFs reprogramming that sustain genetically diverse DLBCLs:
We will identify CAFs sub-populations and ECM composition in genetic DLBCL subtypes; and identify molecular
pathways and reprogramming factors across and within CAFs sub-populations using HSF1 as lead effector. Aim
2. Elucidate the role of CAFs in functionalizing the ECM for immune evasion. We will characterize
biomechanical and biochemical constraints imposed by CAFs to an effective lymphoma immunity. Aim 3.
Determine the therapeutic impact of targeting CAFs in genetic DLBCL subtypes. We will determine the
anti-lymphoma effect of co-targeting CAFs and lymphoma cells in molecularly-defined pre-clinical DLBCL murine
models. The studies that we propose will provide significant insights on the mechanisms of stromal TME
reprogramming for the establishment of genetically defined DLBCLs and will contribute towards development of
novel therapeutic strategies focused on targeting the stromal TME in these entities to increase curability.","485927",

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains a deadly interstitial lung disease (ILD) with treatment
options limited by an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that initiate and perpetuate
disease. A growing literature now implicates lung epithelial dysfunction as playing a role in the events
that lead to downstream fibroblast activation, culminating in relentless fibrosis. These studies,
together with the observation that lung epithelial cells in all forms of IPF display shortened telomeres,
suggests that lung epithelial dysfunction may initiate IPF, and accelerated aging phenotypes or
telomerase pathway abnormalities likely contribute to this pathogenesis. However, without access to
patient-specific human epithelial-mesenchymal model systems, there are limited options for testing
hypotheses of how epithelial changes induced by gene polymorphisms or telomerase perturbations
might mechanistically contribute to IPF. Here we propose to develop a human organoid-based in vitro
model system for the study of IPF. We have established a biorepository of induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) generated from individuals with sporadic or familial pulmonary fibrosis. In aim 1 we
apply this repository by directing the in vitro differentiation of banked IPF iPSCs carrying telomerase
mutations (vs normal iPSCs) into various airway and alveolar lung epithelial cells for the purpose of
generating a reductionist, epithelial-only 3D culture model of the intrinsic epithelial dysfunction that
we posit may initiate pulmonary fibrosis. In aim 2 we augment the complexity of this model by
introducing human organoids composed of iPSC-derived lung epithelia juxtaposed with human
mesenchymal lineages in order to model the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions hypothesized to
perpetuate IPF. Finally, in aim 3 we test the hypothesis that different telomerase pathway mutations
result in shared lung epithelial perturbations, including short telomeres and p53 activation, that then
leads to downstream mesenchymal activation.","608164",

The incident rate of breast cancer for active duty women is seven times higher than the average incident
rate of fifteen other cancer types across all service members. An estimated 90% of deaths due to breast
cancer are a consequence of metastatic disease. Thus, metastasis is a formidable and clearly an unmet
challenge. We identified that NMI (N-Myc Interactor) protein is undetectable in more than 60% of primary
breast tumors that had undergone metastatic dissemination. To recapitulate this clinical scenario, we
generated a mammary specific-NMI knockout (Nmi-KO) mouse. In this model, we deciphered that loss of
NMI allows for unrestrained signaling through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and enables mesenchymal
transition (EMT) of mammary tumors cells leading to increased metastasis. We found that NMI protein loss
is observed predominantly in triple negative breast cancers (TNBC). TNBC is inherently highly invasive and
metastatic and is recognized for aberrantly activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. While investigating cellular
adaptations of TNBC to low doses of a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor, iCRT14, we observed that iCRT14 clearly
decreased the number of nucleoli per TNBC cell.
The nucleolus is the primary site of ribosomal RNAs (rRNA) synthesis and assembly with ribosomal
proteins. It is a vital component in the ability of a cancer cell to meet the dynamic metabolic demands of
tumor progression. Classical pathologic diagnosis of tumor tissue has revealed that nucleolar hypertrophy
and increased nucleolar number are predictive and prognostic parameters of increased mortality. Our
observations reveal that TNBCs show increased number of nucleoli per cell compared to non-TNBC
specimens. Despite the importance of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, there is a clear gap in knowledge about the
relevance of this pathway to nucleolar functions, specifically in TNBCs. We hypothesize that TNBCs are
`addicted to' elevated ribosome biogenesis. Our proposed investigations are designed to test if inhibition of
Wnt/β-catenin signaling will be an effective approach to disable ribosome biogenesis of TNBCs, specifically
in those that lack NMI expression.
While Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been one of the major factors driving TNBC metastases, therapeutic
strategies are still evolving. Our research efforts will advance this field and unravel critical information that

 Environmental exposure of the lung to airborne particulate matter (PM) containing mixed heavy metals 
contributes to development of chronic lung diseases, including asthma. These diseases are classically 
associated with dysregulated epithelial-mesenchymal communication. PM with a particulate size of ≤2.5 µm 
(PM2.5) contain high levels of heavy metals, including cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), and manganese (Mn). 
However, the mechanisms of how these heavy metals contribute to disease pathogenesis are unknown. In 
support of this project, we detected elevated levels of heavy metals in the serum/urine of residents from the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated National Priorities List (NPL) Superfund site in North 
Birmingham. Asthmatic children from this Affected Area have evidence of systemic heavy metals exposure, as 
evidenced by higher urinary levels of arsenic. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid obtained by bronchoscopy of 
asthmatic individuals from this Affected Area contain epithelial cell-derived exosomes that package 
mitochondria. Additionally, BAL-derived exosomes from human asthmatic subjects are skewed towards a 
higher concentration of anti-apoptotic sphingolipids (sphingosine-1-phoshate > ceramide) by SWATH- 
lipidomics analysis. These exosomes are fibrogenic as they induce reprogramming of fibroblasts to an 
apoptosis-resistant and fibrogenic phenotype. Animal studies demonstrate that intra-tracheal instillation of 
heavy metals induces peribronchial fibrosis in mice, providing an opportunity to generate proof-of-concept pre- 
clinical data in support of targeting pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic sphingolipid pathways in environmental 
asthma. 
 The hypothesis to be tested in this project is that heavy metal exposures in children induce airway 
epithelium injury/activation that triggers the release of exosomal lipids to activate fibroblasts/smooth muscle 
cells that contribute to airway hyper-responsiveness and remodeling in asthma. The specific aims are to: (1) 
determine the mechanisms of heavy metal-induced exosomal lipid signaling that activates sub-epithelial

Cellular growth rate alone cannot explain the directed tissue growth that is required for the face to form correctly.
The physical properties of tissue determine how force is distributed – likely guiding and restricting growth of
different regions of the face at different stages of development. The proposed research will determine the role of
tissue physical properties in face formation by a) measuring face tissue physical properties after increasing or
decreasing growth factor signaling required for correct face formation, and b) measuring changes in face shape

Facial morphogenesis involves directed outgrowth of the facial primordia until they appose and fuse with one
another. Currently, outgrowth of primordia is considered to be driven primarily by bulk tissue displacement
caused by proliferation gradients in the mesenchymal tissue. However, our lab and others have found that other
mechanisms, such as directed cellular migration and epithelium guided growth, likely contribute as well. In the
limb bud, tensile forces generated by the ectoderm have been shown to direct cellular orientation and growth,
and proliferation gradients across the limb bud cannot accurately model morphogenesis without incorporating
directed cellular behaviors. Our lab has previously shown that mesenchymal cells in the face are polarized and
that activation of fibroblastic growth factor (FGF) signaling disrupts this polarity while causing aberrant outgrowth
of the primordium. The extracellular matrix (ECM) around cells provides the structural scaffolding required to
generate and guide force through tissue, and the ECM in the epithelium may guide or constrain growth regionally.
I hypothesize that the ECM directs morphogenesis in the face via regional differences in composition and
compliance. I will test this hypothesis with two main aims. In the first aim I will examine how FGF signaling affects
ECM physical properties and cellular organization in the facial primordium. I will quantitatively map the
composition of ECM proteins and ECM compliance across the face with confocal microscopy and atomic force
microscopy, then relate regional differences in these measures to facial shape change. This aim will elucidate
mechanisms by which molecular signaling of fibroblastic growth factor controls morphogenesis through the ECM
and cellular organization. In the second aim, I will increase or decrease tissue compliance directly by altering
collagen crosslinking, then repeat the same analyses as the first aim. The second aim will determine if ECM
stiffness directs outgrowth directly while the mesenchyme passively conforms around it, or if there is feedback
between ECM and cells that actively remodel the environment to direct growth. Failure of the facial primordium
to appose and fuse leads to facial clefting. Understanding the role of ECM in directional growth is important for
understanding the etiology of birth defects in the face.","69362",

 While human and other mammals are limited in their abilities to regenerate, the salamanders, including
Ambystoma mexicanum (axolotl) are highly regenerative and have provided numerous insights into the
mechanisms of organ repair. Upon injury, axolotls generate “blastema” tissue at the wound site, which harbors
multipotent progenitors that engage in regenerative healing, contributing to multiple newly forming cell types.
The inability of mammals to form multipotent blastema cells is commonly thought to be the key barrier to true
regenerative wound healing. Axolotls can also regenerate skin, which normally consists of an epidermis, a two-
layer dermis as well as many secretory glands. Contrary to the prevailing notion that complete tissue
regeneration requires blastema, we now show that the axolotl skin regenerates without a blastema and that, in
fact, blastema formation represses glandular skin regeneration.
 This application will focus on defining a novel cellular and signaling mechanism of blastema-independent
skin regeneration in salamanders. To achieve this goal, this project will leverage the analytical strengths of the
so-called Accessory Limb Model (ALM) – a highly tractable wound model system in axolotls that can be
experimentally directed to either: (i) rapidly regenerate gland-containing skin without a blastema, or (ii) form a
blastema when presented with a deviated nerve and display prominently delayed skin regeneration. Using a
combination of live axolotl imaging, lineage tracing, single-cell RNA-seq, functional protein delivery, and gene
perturbation assays in the ALM model, in our first aim we will establish if amphibian skin gland regeneration
critically depends on epidermal-dermal interactions and if these interactions are prevented in blastema-forming
wounds due to the immaturity of their fibroblasts. The second aim is to uncover new signaling and epigenetic
mechanisms of gland neogenesis in regenerating skin. In particular, we will establish the activating role of the
Bone Morphogenic Protein ligand BMP7 and the counterbalancing role of its antagonist GREMLIN and the
activating role of Class II histone deacetylase HDAC10 – top-listed differentially expressed genes in our RNA-
seq studies – on gland regeneration and skin fibroblast lineage maturation.
 The study premise is strong, based on substantial preliminary data. The proposed studies are
significant because they will introduce amphibian skin as a novel model for studying mechanisms of skin
regeneration and will advance knowledge on skin cell types in amphibians. The proposed studies are innovative
because they will establish a novel paradigm of blastema-independent regeneration and will identify new skin
regeneration-inducing epigenetic and signaling factors. Ultimately, we want to be able to translate new
knowledge learned from this amphibian model system of blastema-independent skin regeneration to better
understand skin regeneration mechanisms in mammals, whose tissues typically heal without a blastema.","207240",

Ameloblastoma accounts for 14% of all odontogenic tumors and African-Americans are five times more likely to
develop ameloblastoma compared to Caucasians. Despite radical surgery, 10% of ameloblastomas recur and
25% of recurrent ameloblastomas occur in the black racial group. The biological determinants of ameloblastoma
racial disparity are unclear and there are no specific biological markers to predict recurrence. Most
ameloblastomas display genetic mutations of BRAF that encodes the serine/threonine protein kinase B-Raf, an
activator of MAPK/ERK-signaling pathway. BRAF oncogenes induce the expression of key autophagic markers
that include LC3, p62 and BECLIN1. High expressions of p62, ATG7 and LC3 have been identified in all variants
of ameloblastoma and our in vivo mouse ameloblastoma tumor model displayed elevated LC3 and p62 levels.
These suggest ameloblastoma recurrence can be attributed to autophagic cell survival mechanisms of residual
invasive neoplastic odontogenic epithelium. Interplay of autophagic regulator BECNLIN1 with RUBICON [Run
domain Beclin-1-interacting and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein], a component of LC3-associated
phagocytosis (LAP) dysregulates autophagosomal maturation and endocytic trafficking to promote tumor
migration and invasiveness. Our hypothesis is that autophagy reactivates residual invasive odontogenic
epithelium by LAP-mediated entosis and recycling of bioenergetic cellular components. Our collaborative group
has a relatively large cohort of ameloblastoma tissues and have generated epithelial-derived (EP-AMCs) and
mesenchymal-derived (MS-AMCs) ameloblastoma cell lines from BRAF V600E+ multicystic/follicular
ameloblastomas. To elucidate biological mechanisms contributing to racial disparity in Black versus White racial
groups, we will determine prognostic biomarkers of ameloblastoma recurrence and assess how LC3-mediated
autophagic ‘cargo’ processing orchestrate recurrence disparity. In Aim 1 we will determine whether autophagic
proteins are pro-oncogenic adaptors associated with ameloblastoma racial disparity, aggressive phenotype and
propensity for recurrence. In Aim 2, we will assess whether residual invasive ameloblastic epithelium survive using
LAP-mediated entosis and recycling of bioenergetic cellular components. While ameloblastoma is relatively rare,
understanding the interplay of two converging cytoprotective pathways in ameloblastoma growth pattern and
recurrence has the potential to lead to new prognostic biomarkers and precision-guided therapies to alleviate
racial disparities in BRAF+ tumors like ameloblastoma.","371719",

blood flow and organ damage (1, 2). A BAV is also an independent risk factor for ascending aortic wall
complications that can lead to rupture and sudden death. However, the cell and molecular basis for the BAV is
unknown. Even basic aspects of BAV formation are undefined due to contributions from multiple cell lineages
and a lack of highly penetrant viable BAV mouse models. Dysfunctional aortic valves exhibit massive
accumulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycans versican (Vcan) and aggrecan (Acan) (3-7) but the
origin and consequence of excess proteoglycans is largely unknown. Since proteoglycans are highly stable,
abundance is regulated primarily by proteolytic degradation which led us to investigate a role for proteoglycan
cleavage. We discovered that loss of a single ECM proteoglycanase, Adamts5, results in enlarged aortic valves
with ascending aortopathies (100%). These defects co-localize with substantial increases in Vcan and Acan in
the affected tissues (8-10) that mirror the human condition. Mechanistically, in Adamts5-/- aortic valve primordia
with excess Vcan there is a reduction of pSmad2, and when Smad2 is reduced further by generating Adamts5-/-
;Smad2+/- mice, there is a high penetrance of BAV (75%), much higher than seen in other mouse BAV models.
The objective of this proposal is to utilize the viable Adamts5-/-;Smad2+/- mice that exhibit a high percentage of
BAV, to define morphological events, cell behaviors and factors that when disrupted contribute to BAV formation.
Since excess Vcan is a hallmark of dysfunctional and diseased valves, use of a model with mutations that impact
the control of Vcan content, may shed light on how proteoglycan metabolism is regulated in development and
may also give insight into disease. Experiments test the hypothesis that ECM Vcan cleavage coordinates
mesenchymal cell behaviors and myocardial cell contributions that are required for the tricuspid morphology of
aortic valves. The hypothesis is tested in two aims: Aim 1 tests the impact of altered Vcan cleavage on
mesenchymal cell lineage behaviors that are required for aortic valve formation. Our preliminary data show that
loss of Vcan cleaved fragments and excess intact Vcan, disrupted lineage-specific patterning in the developing
aortic valves of the BAV Adamts5-/-;Smad2+/-mice. A combination of ex vivo, and in vivo approaches will decipher
the lineage-specific cell behaviors, and guidance factors that are dependent on Vcan cleavage and to prevent
BAV. Although dogma states that valve cusps arise from mesenchymal cells, Aim 2 investigates the
consequence of excess Vcan on the myocardial cell lineage contributions to the developing aortic valve in
Adamts5-/-;Smad2+/- mice and other murine models of BAV. Our preliminary data show myocardial lineage
expression of Adamts5 is required to clear Vcan-rich ECM and to form the non-coronary cusp of the aortic valve.
Due to the emerging prevalence of excess Vcan in BAV, the investigation into ECM turnover will allow insight
into the molecular and cellular origins of aortic valve diseases, which may lead to therapeutic advances.","517482",

Metastatic tumors often develop chemoresistance, which makes chemotherapy ineffective. We have exciting
evidence that beta-blockers, which are widely used cardiac drugs, can be repurposed to improve the effects of
chemotherapy. If we could understand how beta-blockers enhance the effects of chemotherapy, this would
expedite the translation of beta-blockers for treatment of patients with metastatic cancer, who are at high risk for
anxiety and depression and tend to have elevated levels of endogenous stress hormones including epinephrine.
Here we will test the hypothesis that beta-blockers can improve access of chemotherapy drugs to the tumor by
decreasing tumor density or stiffness to improve chemotherapy response. Our recent work shows that beta-
blockers modulate the physical tension of tumor cells. Building on these findings, we will test if beta-blockers can
be used to make tumors more porous to increase the delivery of chemotherapy drugs to tumor cells and enhance
the response of tumor cells to chemotherapy agents, paclitaxel and doxorubicin. We will also determine how the
effects of ?-blockers on tumor cell chemosensitivity are modulated by matrix stiffness through RhoA and ROCK.
Beta-blockers are already well established for clinical use for heart disease, and are showing promising effects
on tumor biology in prospective clinical trials, which provides strong rationale for continued biological analysis of
the basic mechanisms involved to guide biomarker selection as this field advances toward Phase III clinical trials.
Repurposing beta-blockers to enhance chemotherapy response could thus have patient-related outcomes on a
short timescale of 5 years.","164092",

the lung causes elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance that culminates in right heart failure. In this proposal,
we relate the progressive nature of PAH to the impact of high shear stress (HSS) on pulmonary arterial (PA)
endothelial (EC) and smooth muscle cell (SMC) gene regulation and function with the view that we might be able
to use this mechanistic information to reverse established disease. In response to a previous RFA on ‘integrative
omics’, we related PAEC enhancer promoter interactions to differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under
physiologic conditions of laminar shear stress (LSS). LSS resulted in differential chromatin accessibility,
assessed by ATAC Seq, at sites where the transcription factor KLF4 bound DNA at H3K27ac enhancer sites, as
assessed by ChIP Seq. However, we could only relate the LSS enhancers to one third of DEGs on the basis of
‘nearest gene’. By incorporating HiChIP and the Activity by Contact (ABC) algorithm, we were able to relate
distal enhancers to 80% of DEGs, including skipped genes and those related to PAH, such as BMPR2. HSS is
prevalent when there is established vascular disease narrowing the vascular lumen, or if PAH is initiated by the
high pulmonary blood flow and pressure of a congenital heart defect. In our Preliminary Studies, we show that
HSS has a major impact on expression of PAEC homeostatic genes such as BMPR2, JAG1, ERG, and ELN;
moreover, there is heightened expression of endothelial mesenchymal transition (EndMT) genes, such as
SNAI1, and increased PAEC permeability and monocyte adhesion. Our ability to build PA EC-SMC bilayers in
fibrin gels allows us to study vascular cell interactions under LSS and HSS. Our overarching hypothesis is that
changes in PAEC and PAEC-SMC interaction in response to HSS adversely impact the enhancer landscape,
gene regulation and function, and can be reversed to prevent progressive PAH pathology. To investigate this,
we propose three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we characterize perturbations in the enhancer-promoter
landscape that account for aberrant gene regulation under HSS in control and PAH PAEC, and we link these
features to functional abnormalities in permeability, inflammation and EndMT, and to changes in genes and
proteins in the PA tissue of PAH patients. In Specific Aim 2, we biofabricate tubular structures with PAEC lining
the lumen and SMC surrounding the EC, to determine how cell-cell interactions impact HSS vs LSS mediated
gene regulation and function, including SMC proliferation and elastin fiber formation. In Specific Aim 3, we
focus on the pronounced HSS mediated reduction in ERG in control and PAH PAEC, to determine if this feature
is necessary and sufficient for the HSS-mediated abnormal PAEC gene expression and function. We determine
whether the HSS mediated elevation in miR-96 and the reduction in ERG can be subverted by the miR-96
antagomir, both in PAH cells and in a transgenic mouse with deficient ERG. These studies should provide new
avenues for intervention to reverse disease by subverting the root cause of HSS mediated-progressive PAH.","665804",

The overall goal of this project is to define how interactions between breast stem cells and environmental
stressors drive the biological basis of racial disparities in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). TNBC
incidence in African American women is two to three-fold higher than in European Americans. The biological
mechanisms underlying this striking disparity are not well understood. Our preliminary data identifies
widespread racial disparities in exposure to a multitude of environmental toxicants including phthalates and
parabens. The breast cancer windows of susceptibility hypothesis states that environmental exposures in
utero, or during puberty and pregnancy, disproportionately increase breast cancer risk. Exposures during
windows of susceptibility could modify risk by the increasing the number of stem cells, altering stem cell
epigenetic reprogramming, or by otherwise changing stem cell biology. Using single cell RNA expression
profiling, we have identified a rare breast stem cell population with hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal
characteristics and an RNA expression pattern resembling TNBCs. What factors regulate these cells, including
the influence of race/ethnicity or environmental exposures, are unknown. The objective of this proposal to
dissect the role of stem cells and the environment in the biology of TNBC racial disparities. We will
experimentally challenge normal human breast stem cells isolated from epidemiologically well characterized
women ex vivo with prototypical toxicants and toxicants prioritized because of racial exposure disparities. Our
central hypothesis is that differences in normal stem cell biology, attributable to either genetic or environmental
factors (or a gene-environment interaction), underlie TNBC disparities. We will test this hypothesis with three
Specific Aims: (1) Test for differences in normal breast stem cell biology in African American and European
American women by single cell RNA sequencing, three-dimensional ex vivo culture, and epigenomic profiling.
(2) Define the disparities in exposure to environmental toxicants between African American and European
American women in a nationally representative dataset. (3) Test for differential effects of environmental
toxicants on African American and European American breast stem cells. This interdisciplinary study will use
state-of-the-art techniques which integrate basic breast stem cell biology with exposure assessment,
environmental epidemiology, and toxicology. We expect that the findings from this study will provide significant
impact for reduction of TNBC incidence and mortality by defining the factors that cause TNBC disparities,
providing actionable targets for precision breast cancer prevention.","36468",

and pathology. Unlike other fields, such as cardiovascular and muscle physiology and neuroscience, to date
very little effort has been directed towards mitochondrial research in the bone field. This presents an immense
knowledge gap and a critical barrier to developing novel mitochondria-targeted strategies for bone pathologies,
such as aging and trauma which are known to be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. This also gives
special significance to our mitochondria-centered proposal. Our objective here is to determine the mechanism
controlling mitochondrial activity during osteoblastic (OB) differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC,
a.k.a. bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells) and test if strategies aimed at improving mitochondrial metabo-
lism stimulate OB differentiation and bone formation. Our published and new unpublished data indicate that
during OB differentiation, mitochondria fuse into a network, a phenomenon known to maximize the fidelity for
oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). A dangerous byproduct of active OxPhos is oxidative stress which pro-
motes opening of a large Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (MPTP). MPTP opening impairs mito-
chondrial integrity and function. Cyclophilin D (CypD) is a key positive regulator of MPTP. It is, thus beneficial
for cells undergoing a shift towards oxidative metabolism, e.g. BMSCs differentiating into OBs, to inactivate
CypD/MPTP. We indeed found that as mitochondria become fused and activated during OB differentiation,
CypD is downregulated at the mRNA level ensuring protection against oxidative stress and supporting OxPhos
and progression of OB program. Moreover, our data indicate that CypD genetic deletion in knockout (KO) mice
or pharmacological inhibition is especially efficient in supporting OB oxidative and bone forming function under
pathological stress, such as in aging and fracture. We recently reported that CypD KO mice are well protected
against bone loss in aging. This is consistent with the literature showing that brain, heart, and kidney tissues of
CypD KO mice are protected against degeneration in aging or ischemic injury. All this led us to hypothesize
that mitochondrial fusion and CypD downregulation leading to activation of OxPhos and inhibition of MPTP dur-
ing OB differentiation, are critical for OB differentiation. To test this hypothesis and fulfill our objective, we will:
1) characterize the mechanism by which mitochondria are activated during OB differentiation focusing on mito-
chondrial fusion; 2) characterize the role and regulation of CypD/MPTP during OB differentiation; and 3) evalu-
ate CypD as a therapeutic target to improve bone formation in fracture healing and aging. These studies will
provide comprehensive understanding of regulation of mitochondrial metabolism during OB differentiation and
a rationale for developing new mitochondria-targeted therapeutic strategies in bone.","304920",

strong risk factor for additional cardiovascular events. Currently, there are no therapeutic options for CAVD other
than valve replacement or repair due in part to the incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
Interestingly, AV calcification develops in a side-specific manner, occurring preferentially on the fibrosa side
exposed to d-flow while the ventricularis side exposed to stable flow is spared. Another mechanical force,
elevated stretching commonly observed in bicuspid (BAV) and diseased valves and hypertension, also correlates
well with CAVD. These suggest a potential role for d-flow and elevated stretch in the pathogenesis of CAVD, but
the mechanism is unclear. Our goal is to define the role and mechanisms of the mechanical forces in CAVD
pathogenesis and use the knowledge to develop novel anti-CAVD therapeutics. In the previous funding cycle,
we have identified several flow- and side-dependent microRNAs (miRNAs) in human AV endothelial cells
(HAVECs) and pig AVs (PAVs) and began determining their roles in CAVD. Recently, we have identified a novel
flow- and stretch-sensitive miR-483-3p (miR-483), which has exciting potential as a critical regulator of CAVD
pathogenesis. Our preliminary data show that miR-483 expression is decreased 1) by d-flow (OS) compared to
stable flow (LS) in HAVECs, 2) in the fibrosa layer compared to the ventricularis in human and pig AVs, and 3)
by pathological stretch conditions in PAVs ex vivo. Further data indicate that miR-483 inhibits EC inflammation
and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), critical pathobiological events in CAVD, and that a key
gene target of miR-483 is Ube2c (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), which in turn may target the hypoxia-
inducible factor (HIF1α) via controlling its upstream regulator pVHL. HIF1α's role in CAVD is unclear, but its well-
known target genes include VEGF (angiogenesis and inflammation), TGFβ (fibrosis and calcification), Runx2
(calcification) and Twist1 (EndoMT), key CAVD pathogenic processes. Therefore, our overarching hypothesis is
that miR-483 is an anti-CAVD miRNA, which is reduced under OS/pathological stretch conditions, leading to an
increase in Ube2c, which in turn ubiquitinates pVHL for its degradation and increases the HIF1α level. HIFα,
then, stimulates its target genes leading to inflammation, EndoMT, AV sclerosis and calcification. We will test
this in 3 Aims. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms by which miR-483 regulates shear-dependent responses of
HAVECs and PAVs in a Ube2c- and the HIF1α-dependent manner in vitro and ex vivo. Aim 2 will determine the
role of miR-483 in stretch-dependent calcification of HAVICs and PAVs ex vivo via Ube2c and HIF1α-dependent
mechanisms. Aim 3 is an in vivo study where miR-483, Ube2c, and HIF1α will be modified genetically,
molecularly or pharmacologically in a novel mouse model of CAVD that we just developed by treating GATA5-/-
BAV mice with AAV-PCSK9 to induce hypercholesterolemia. Here, we will test their roles and their anti-CAVD
therapeutic potential.","539425",

(IDC) when the carcinoma invades through the basement membrane (BM) into the stromal tissue. Invasion is a
key step in ductal carcinoma progression that is associated with an increased likelihood for metastasis, the
most deadly aspect of breast cancer. During metastasis, cancer cells must also invade BM during intravasation
and extravasation. Cancer cells are thought to utilize proteases to degrade the BM during invasion of the BM
using specialized structures known as invadopodia. Known modes of protease-independent invasion and
migration, involving cells squeezing through pores in the ECM, would be inhibited by the nanoporous nature of
the BM. However, physiological ECM is viscoelastic, exhibiting some characteristics of viscous fluids, and
cellular forces can induce flow and permanent deformation of the matrix. In other words, viscoelastic ECM is
malleable, and cell generated forces may expand pores, providing a mechanism for cells to mechanically
remodel the ECM and physically clear a path for migration, independent of proteases. While malleability is
related to matrix viscosity, it is distinct from matrix elasticity. Interestingly, malignant breast lesions have been
found to exhibit a greater degree of viscosity than benign lesions. Importantly, the concept of malleability might
be relevant to protease-dependent migration as well, as the action of proteases may be to make the matrix
more malleable. The specific hypothesis to be tested in this application is that malleability is a key physical
parameter of the BM that mediates protease-dependent and protease-independent cancer cell invasion and
migration. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary studies finding that cancer cells can invade and migrate
through nanoporous matrices that contain BM ligands with intermediate or high-malleability in a protease-
independent manner, utilizing invadopodial like protrusions to initiate invasion, but are unable to invade and
migrate through matrices with low malleability. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following three
specific aims: (1) Fabricate materials for 3D cell culture with independently tunable malleability that present
ligands and stiffness relevant to the BM of mammary epithelium; (2) Determine how ECM malleability regulates
invadopodial protrusions; and (3)! Identify molecular and biophysical mechanisms underlying protease-
independent migration through ECMs with different levels of malleability. This approach is innovative because
of its focus on understanding the role of malleability in mediating protease-independent and -dependent
invasion and migration, as malleability is a physical characteristic of ECM, related to matrix viscosity but
distinct from elasticity or density, which has been largely ignored in studies to date. The proposed research is
significant because it will reveal the role of ECM malleability in mediating both protease-dependent and
protease-independent invasion and migration by breast cancer cells, potentially uncovering previously un-
described modes of invasion or migration.","324385",

The overall goal of this project is to define how interactions between breast stem cells and environmental
stressors drive the biological basis of racial disparities in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs). TNBC
incidence in African American women is two to three-fold higher than in European Americans. The biological
mechanisms underlying this striking disparity are not well understood. Our preliminary data identifies
widespread racial disparities in exposure to a multitude of environmental toxicants including phthalates and
parabens. The breast cancer windows of susceptibility hypothesis states that environmental exposures in
utero, or during puberty and pregnancy, disproportionately increase breast cancer risk. Exposures during
windows of susceptibility could modify risk by the increasing the number of stem cells, altering stem cell
epigenetic reprogramming, or by otherwise changing stem cell biology. Using single cell RNA expression
profiling, we have identified a rare breast stem cell population with hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal
characteristics and an RNA expression pattern resembling TNBCs. What factors regulate these cells, including
the influence of race/ethnicity or environmental exposures, are unknown. The objective of this proposal to
dissect the role of stem cells and the environment in the biology of TNBC racial disparities. We will
experimentally challenge normal human breast stem cells isolated from epidemiologically well characterized
women ex vivo with prototypical toxicants and toxicants prioritized because of racial exposure disparities. Our
central hypothesis is that differences in normal stem cell biology, attributable to either genetic or environmental
factors (or a gene-environment interaction), underlie TNBC disparities. We will test this hypothesis with three
Specific Aims: (1) Test for differences in normal breast stem cell biology in African American and European
American women by single cell RNA sequencing, three-dimensional ex vivo culture, and epigenomic profiling.
(2) Define the disparities in exposure to environmental toxicants between African American and European
American women in a nationally representative dataset. (3) Test for differential effects of environmental
toxicants on African American and European American breast stem cells. This interdisciplinary study will use
state-of-the-art techniques which integrate basic breast stem cell biology with exposure assessment,
environmental epidemiology, and toxicology. We expect that the findings from this study will provide significant
impact for reduction of TNBC incidence and mortality by defining the factors that cause TNBC disparities,
providing actionable targets for precision breast cancer prevention.","372283",

The overall goal of this proposal is to define the role of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in endothelial cells
in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Exciting preliminary data generated through genomic
sequencing experiments show that endothelial GR up-regulates canonical Wnt signaling and that suppression
of Wnt signaling can improve atherosclerosis, quiet inflammation, and restore central endothelial metabolic
defects. The Wnt pathways have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and other states
of vascular inflammation though have not been well-studied in cell-specific environments.
To investigate the effects of endothelial-cell specific canonical Wnt signaling suppression we propose the
following Aims:
In Aim 1, we will characterize the atherosclerotic phenotype of a novel double-mutant mouse model that lacks
the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 and 6 (LRP5/LRP6) in endothelial cells.
These are key proteins necessary for canonical Wnt signaling. In addition, we will analyze endothelial cell
inflammation, vascular function, and nitric oxide production in this model. We will also examine markers of fibrosis
and systemic blood pressure.
In Aim 2, our broad goal is to analyze central endothelial metabolism and gene expression in the presence and
absence of Wnt signaling. In Aim 2.1 we plan to evaluate the in vitro metabolic phenotypes of endothelial cells
with suppressed Wnt signaling by assaying fatty acid oxidation, cellular lipid metabolism, mitochondrial
bioenergetics, and fuel preference. In Aim 2.2, we will examine endothelial cell heterogeneity by performing
single-cell RNA-seq from aortas of mice with augmented and suppressed Wnt signaling. These studies will be
extended by examining chromatin capture conformation in key differentially-regulated metabolic genes. These
data sets will be integrated to conclude how chromatin conformation affects the functionality of key genes of
interest.","578002",

and/or overexpressed in over a third of all breast cancers, and that CK1δ activation is especially manifest in
refractory forms of breast cancer such as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that lacks targeted therapies.
Further, we established that silencing CK1δ, or inhibition of CK1δ kinase activity with our nanomolar potent,
highly selective small molecule dual inhibitor of CK1δ and CK1ε, specifically compromises the growth, survival
and invasion of breast cancer cells that overexpress CK1δ. Notably, CK1δ inhibition also provokes tumor
regression of TNBC, including lung metastatic TNBC and basal-like PDX breast cancer models, and without
any overt side effects. Finally, we demonstrated that CK1δ inhibition disables WNT/β-catenin signaling, a
frequently activated yet heretofore undruggable pathway that is activated in a broad cast of human
malignancies. Importantly, our new studies suggest roles for CK1δ in TNBC metastasis, where we have now
shown that CK1δ signaling is necessary to sustain the expression of: (i) transcription factors that direct the
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), including Zeb1 and Snail2; (ii) matrix metalloproteinases-1
(MMP1), MMP2 and MMP9 that control TNBC cell invasion; and (iii) the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)
factors Bmi1 and Sox9 that control self renewal. Finally, we have shown that our CK1δ inhibitors have synergy
with select in-clinic DNA-damaging chemotherapies used to treat TNBC. Collectively, these data support the
hypotheses that CK1δ is a driver of breast cancer metastases and that targeting CK1δ will block and
improve treatment of metastatic triple negative breast cancer. Accordingly, in Aim1 we will use an iterative
and rigorous research operating plan (ROP) to improve the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of our dual
CK1δ/CK1ε inhibitors, and will develop and test the efficacy of CK1δ-selective inhibitors, to deliver safety
assessment candidates suitable for subsequent IND-enabling studies. This ROP includes tests of synergy of
our inhibitors with in-clinic agents used to treat TNBC. Further, using genetic approaches and our CK1δ
inhibitors, in Aim 2 we will test roles for CK1δ in each step of the metastatic cascade, including intravasation,
extravasation, latency and/or establishment at the secondary site. Finally, in Aim 3, using phosphoproteomics,
activity-based proteomic profiling, and RNA-seq we will identify and test the roles of downstream effectors of
CK1δ in controlling TNBC metastasis, and the EMT, MMPs and BCSC targets of CK1δ signaling. These
studies, and those in TNBC that we have generated that are resistant to our CK1δ/ε inhibitors, will define acute
and chronic changes in components of the kinome that could be exploited for combination studies, to improve
therapeutic response and block the emergence of resistance. We submit our research program will establish
CK1δ as a vulnerability to target metastatic triple negative breast cancer, and that the small molecule CK1δ/ε

Aging is associated with progressive decline in lung function and increased incidence of lung
diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Accumulating evidence suggests
that early lung aging events are dominated by functional/imaging abnormalities in the distal (or small)
airways. This is particularly relevant to COPD, for which derangement of the distal airway architecture,
with loss of pre-/terminal bronchioles and remodeling of remaining small airways, is a typical pathologic
feature that occurs prior to emphysema and correlates with severity of airway obstruction. Therefore, it
is possible that mechanisms underlying the physiological lung aging may be involved in COPD patho-
genesis. So far, relatively little is known about the specific nature and biologic basis of distal airway ag-
ing in the human lung. Our preliminary data show that with aging, the distal airway epithelium (DAE),
which covers the distal airway luminal surface and is maintained by the DAE-resident basal stem cells
(BC), acquires an aberrant, proximal airway-like transcriptome pattern, with up-regulation of a distinct
set of BC genes and molecular features of altered EGFR, FGFR, Notch, VEGF and inflammatory cyto-
kine signaling. These changes were apparent in healthy subjects ≥45 years old, associated with smok-
ing and resembled the DAE phenotype observed in COPD subjects. Further, in our preliminary studies
we have established the methodology to isolate region-specific BC and mesenchymal niche cells from
human distal airways, evaluate molecular profiles of this airway region at tissue microdomain- and sin-
gle-cell levels, and reconstruct aging-related, COPD-relevant distal airway phenotypes using patient-
derived organotypic models. Based on these initial data and methodologies, the proposed Human Dis-
tal Airway Aging (HDAA) project will systematically evaluate distal airways from donors of different
age without or with COPD to address the following three Specific aims: Aim 1. Assemble the molecu-
lar atlas of human distal airway aging and test the hypothesis that, with aging, distal airway epithelium
loses its region-specific transcriptome pattern and acquires a COPD-like gene expression phenotype.
Aim 2. Assess the spatial distribution of aging-related architectural and differentiation patterns in the
human distal airways and test the hypothesis that aging is associated with acquisition of heterogene-
ously distributed COPD-relevant distal airway remodeling phenotypes. Aim 3. Test the hypothesis that,
with aging, distal airway basal stem cells become less capable of regenerating the normally differenti-
ated distal airway epithelium, but instead produce COPD-like airway remodeling phenotypes, due to
their aging-related reprogramming or altered crosstalk with the mesenchymal niche. In the translational
branch of aim 3, these patient-derived models will be tested as pre-clinical platforms for identification
and therapeutic targeting of aging-related COPD-relevant distal airway remodeling phenotypes.","568487",

therapeutic property of gold nanoparticles (GNPs). In the current application, exploiting self-therapeutic GNP
(ST-GNP) as a probe, we are proposing a unique concept of capturing, identifying and validating therapeutic
targets responsible for tumor growth and therapy resistance in cancer.
 We demonstrated that ST-GNP inhibited functions of a number of tumor-promoting heparin-binding
growth factors (HB-GFs) via binding through the HB-domain that altered protein conformations, whereas
conformations and functions of non-HB-GFs remained unaltered. In addition, among various sizes, GNP of 20
nm size demonstrated highest therapeutic efficacy whereas GNP of 100 nm size was non self-therapeutic (NST-
GNP). Importantly, ST-GNP inhibited tumor growth, metastasis and sensitized ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin
by reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and abrogating MAPK-signaling (Fig 1) In orthotopic
model of pancreatic cancer, we reported that ST-GNP disrupted cross-talk between cancer cells and cancer
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and reprogrammed tumor microenvironment that inhibited tumor growth.
Investigating protein enrichment on ST-GNP from ovarian cancer or normal cellular lysates, we identified
SMNDC1 and PPA1, as potential new targets for tumor growth. Furthermore, we recently reported that non-toxic
Auroliposome enhanced silencing efficacy of siRNA and more effectively inhibited ovarian tumor growth
compared to traditional DOTAP-DOPE based liposomal delivery of siRNA. Based on these results, we
hypothesize that functions of the proteins enriched on ST-GNP will be inhibited resulting in tumor growth
inhibition and therapy resistance. Therefore, these ST-GNP-enriched proteins may serve as potential therapeutic
targets. We will use specific aims below to test our hypothesis;
Specific aim 1: Investigating protein enrichment on ST-GNP.
Specific aim 2: Validating therapeutic targets in animal models.
Impact: Protein corona around NPs is evolving as a unique signature for personalized medicine. Our findings
support that the ST-GNP could be utilized to identify therapeutic targets not only for ovarian and pancreatic
cancer but in diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and rheumatoid arthritis as well where others have
reported ST property of GNP to inhibit angiogenesis in these models.","398989",

disruptions cause abnormalities of hearing and/or balance. With the advent of cochlear implantation to treat
hearing loss even in cases of inner ear malformation, it is critical to understand exactly how such malformations
affect the auditory ganglia and innervation. Also, in light of the intense focus on in vitro generation of inner ear
cell types for transplantation and in vivo manipulation of developmental signaling molecules to promote
differentiation of various inner ear cells for hearing restoration, elucidating the roles and regulation of such
signals and their effectors governing otic differentiation and morphogenesis are necessary to advance treatment.
 The genes encoding FGF3 and FGF10, ligands that signal through FGFR2b and FGFR1b, are expressed
dynamically throughout otic development in both epithelial and ganglion domains. Studies conducted by the
Mansour Lab of both conventional Fgf3 and Fgf10 conditional knockout mice and those expressing a
doxycycline-inducible ligand trap (dnFGFR2b) that rapidly inhibits signaling through both FGFR1b and
FGFR2b, showed that Fgf3 and Fgf10 are not required in the placode lineage for otocyst formation, but are
required subsequently for otocyst patterning, neuroblast maintenance, epithelial proliferation and both
vestibular and cochlear morphogenesis. Furthermore, the first genome wide analyses of otocyst mRNA revealed
FGFR2b/1b signaling targets that define novel candidates for genes involved in otic morphogenesis and function.
 This proposal has two Aims addressing the hypotheses that 1) FGFR2b/1b signaling is required continuously
for both otic neuroblast specification and maintenance, and that at later stages, mesenchymal signaling, as well
as that in the epithelial and ganglion domains, is required for cochlear epithelial differentiation and ganglion
maintenance and 2) FGFR2b/1b downstream target genes mediate some or all of the effects of FGFR2b/1b
signaling on otic morphogenesis and gangliogenesis. To determine the early role of FGFR2b/1b signaling in otic
ganglion formation and its later role in epithelial differentiation and ganglion maintenance, DOX-induced
ubiquitous and CRE-limited expression of dnFGFR2b will be employed and morphology and molecular markers
of otic patterning, proliferation and survival in both tissues will be assessed. To determine the roles of
downstream targets of FGFR2b/1b signaling, two genes encoding transcription factors that are activated by
FGFR2b/1b signaling and one gene encoding a BMP signaling regulator that is repressed by FGFR2b/1b
signaling will be studied. Otic conditional mutants will be generated for each gene, and their morphologic and
functional development will be assessed. In addition, the extent to which the BMP regulator contributes to the
dnFGFR2b phenotypes and the effects of overexpressing the BMP regulator will be assessed.
 The results will contribute new knowledge that will facilitate future efforts to manipulate the FGF signaling
system for hearing restoration.","372657",

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal chronic lung disease, affecting over 5 million people
worldwide. To date, there are no therapies that effectively stop progression or reverse the disease. IPF is
characterized by altered cellular composition and dysfunction of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction in the
peripheral lung, leading to excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and progressive scarring. The
IPF lung is characterized by a heterogeneous distribution of normal or mildly affected regions, alternating with
regions of significant fibrosis containing septal thickening, honeycombing, aberrant epithelial reprogramming,
and fibroblastic foci. Since homeostasis and regeneration of the human lung after injury is controlled by delicate
interplay between the ECM and multiple resident cell populations, it is imperative to define the sequential
contributions of enhanced ECM secretion and crosslinking on cellular functions. Hence, the definition of the
sequential hierarchy of enhanced ECM composition or stiffness obtained by crosslinking enzyme activity on
resident lung cell function will enable the identification of precise therapeutic angles for IPF. The overarching
goal of this application is to define the composition and crosslinking pattern of the fibrotic ECM, to
assess the contribution of fibroblasts to the fibrotic ECM, to mechanistically interrogate the contribution
of a prototypic crosslinking enzyme, transglutaminase (TGM) 2, to the above, and to assess its reciprocal
effect on alveolar epithelial cell function. We hypothesize that IPF ECM exhibits specific changes and cues,
produced by resident fibroblasts and generated by TGM2-dependent crosslinks, which in turn alter lung epithelial
cell function and reprogramming. To pursue this hypothesis, we propose a cascade of specific aims: In Aim1,
we will utilize a novel proteomics approach in order to define, quantify, and validate, in the greatest possible
detail and accuracy, changes in the composition and architecture of the ECM in lung fibrosis by quantifying its
composition and crosslinking patterns. In Aim 2, we propose to identify the ECM secreted by control and IPF
primary fibroblasts and determine the effect of fibroblast-derived TGM2 on ECM composition and crosslinking.
In Aim 3, we will investigate whether and how fibroblast-derived TGM2 affects development of lung fibrosis and
ATII cell reprogramming. This proposal is based on the new concept that resident lung cell fate is reciprocally
determined by the (fibrotic) ECM. The proposed project will provide unprecedented detail and novel insights into
ECM composition and crosslinking patterns in the normal and fibrotic human lung. We will generate novel
knowledge on ECM-cell interaction with respect to resident lung cell function and tissue regeneration in IPF. The
project will explore a major under-investigated area in lung pathologies and provide substantial groundwork for
the development of novel therapies for IPF, which likely will extend to other chronic lung diseases driven by
changes in ECM composition, such as asthma, chronic lung allograft dysfunction, or COPD.","554997",

has an essential role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. We revealed that cytoplasmic ERβ interacts with the
apoptosis machinery and inflammasome complex in endometriotic tissues to prevent apoptosis and stimulate
cell proliferation activity, respectively. However, the function of nuclear ERβ in the pathogenesis of endometriosis
has not yet been elucidated. To fill this gap in the scientific knowledge, we have determined the endometriotic
tissue-specific ERβ-regulated transcriptome and ERβ-cistrome by using a novel endometrium-specific ERβ
overexpression mouse model. Our new omics data provided three unique aspects of nuclear ERβ function that
drive endometriosis progression. 1) The increases in anti-apoptosis signaling in the endometrium is one of the
critical drivers that promote the progression of endometriosis. Our omics data revealed that the ERβ/Nuclear
Factor of Activated T-cell 5 (NFAT5) complex directly downregulates the expression of N-Myc and STAT
Interactor (NMI), which stimulates interferon (IFN)α-induced cell death signaling. In Aim 1, we will investigate
the role of NMI in IFNα-induced cell death signaling in the normal endometrium and then identify whether the
ERβ/NFAT5 complex downregulates the expression of NMI in endometriotic lesions to enhance endometriosis.
Since epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is elevated in endometriotic tissue and involved in anti-
apoptosis, we will also investigate the role of EGFR in the ERβ/NFAT5-mediated suppression of NMI expression
in endometriotic tissues. 2) The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical step for endometriosis. Our
omics data showed that the ERβ/Early Growth Response Protein 1 (EGR1) axis directly increased the expression
of Fibrillin1 (FBN1), which is an activator of EMT, in ectopic lesions. In Aim 2, we will define the role of FBN1 in
endometriosis-associated EMT in ectopic lesions and then determine whether the ERβ/EGR1 axis upregulates
FBN1 gene expression in ectopic lesions to stimulate EMT in ectopic lesions. Since EGFR signaling also plays
an essential role in EMT, the role of EGFR in ERβ/EGR1 axis-mediated EMT will be investigated. 3) To establish
endometriosis, angiogenesis is activated in ectopic lesions. However, the molecular mechanism of estrogen-
induced angiogenesis in ectopic lesions has not been elucidated. Our data revealed that ERβ elevated the
expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), which is the activator of hypoxia inducible factor 1a
(HIF1A)-mediated angiogenesis, in ectopic lesions. In Aim 3, we will define the role of CTGF in endometriosis-
associated angiogenesis and then determine whether the ERβ/HIF1A axis upregulates CTGF gene expression
in ectopic lesions to stimulate angiogenesis. Since EGFR signaling also plays an essential role in angiogenesis,
the role of EGFR in ERβ/HIF1A axis-mediated angiogenesis will be investigated. Collectively, these three ERβ
gene networks will conceptionally advance our understanding of the molecular etiology of endometriosis and
should provide new molecular therapeutic targets for alternative endometriosis therapies.","339716",

 The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family cytokines regulate cell differentiation and morphogenesis, cell
proliferation and migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and metastatic dissemination. TGF-β is an
immunoregulatory cytokine well known to inhibit activation and differentiation of CD4+ effector cells and promote
suppressor functions of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells. Despite increased understanding of how TGF-β regulates T
cell functions, the immunomodulatory roles of many other members of the TGF-β cytokine family, especially
bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), remain largely unknown.
 We have found that Bone Morphogenic Protein Receptor 1α (BMPR1α, Alk-3) expressed by naive and
activated CD4+ T cells and Foxp3+ regulatory T (TR) cells, modulates functions effector Th and TR cells.
Abrogating BMPR1α signaling leads to generation of pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 effector cells expressing high
levels of inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ, IL-17 and TNF family proteins. BMPR1α-deficient CD4+ T cells do not
generate adaptive TR (aTR) cells. Inactivation of BMPR1α gene in peripheral TR cells reduced Foxp3 expression
leading to the instability of TR phenotype and accumulation of exTR cells. Jmjd3 (Kdm6b) demethylase was
identified as target of BMPR1α signaling in TR cells and epigenetic changes as a cause of lost suppressor
function. We hypothesize that BMPs and BMPR1α may represent regulatory modules shaping epigenetic
landscape and priming T cells for transcriptional regulation mediated by TGF-β.
 BMPR1α is not the only receptor binding BMPs, these cytokines may also bind activin receptors including Alk2.
To get further mechanistic insight how BMPs and TGF-β regulate functions of peripheral Th and TR cells we
propose to generate conditional knockout mice where Alk2 gene is deleted in all T cells or in TR cells. Alk2 mutant
mice will be compared to mice lacking BMPR1α gene in the respective T cell subsets. The goal of this proposal
is to produce experimental mice which could be examined to understand how Alk2 and BMPR1α cooperate to
deliver BMP and TGF-β mediated signaling to regulate CD4+ Th and TR cells.","77500",

Nickel (Ni) compounds are environmental toxicants, prevalent in the atmosphere due to their use in several
industrial processes, as well as extensive consumption of Ni containing products such as stainless steel,
batteries, medical devices and medical implants. In addition, combustion of fossil fuels is a major source of Ni
contamination in the atmosphere. Exposure to Ni is a major human health hazard, associated with a multitude
of health risks including allergic contact dermatitis, bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and pulmonary edema.
Moreover, epidemiological studies indicate cancer development as a major outcome of Ni exposure. However,
the molecular basis of Ni-induced diseases remains poorly understood. To better understand the molecular
mechanisms underlying Ni-induced diseases, we investigated the effects of Ni-exposure on human epithelial
cells. Our studies show that Ni-exposure-induced gene expression changes persist long after the cessation of
exposure. This resulted in the cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the EMT
phenotype continued long after the termination of exposure. EMT is the process in which polarized epithelial
cells lose cell-cell adhesion and acquire invasive and migratory mesenchymal properties. EMT is implicated in a
number of diseases associated with Ni-exposure including asthma, fibrosis, cancer and metastasis. Therefore,
our results suggest that persistent transcriptional changes caused by Ni exposure are likely important in the
etiology of Ni-exposure associated diseases. The overarching goal of this grant is to understand the
mechanisms that drive long-term transcriptional changes caused by Ni exposure. Our preliminary results suggest
that Ni-exposure disrupts chromatin regulation mediated by the histone modification, H3K27me3 and the zinc
finger protein, CTCF. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that Ni-exposure increases
chromatin accessibility through H3K27me3 loss, causing gene upregulation. CTCF binds the newly
accessible chromatin and prevents H3K27me3 re-establishment after termination of Ni-exposure,
thereby persistently altering gene expression. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role of H3K27me3-loss in Ni-
induced persistent gene expression alterations in human lung epithelial cells. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
mechanisms underlying Ni-induced persistent chromatin alterations by knocking-down CTCF and by disrupting
CTCF binding sites using CRISPR/Cas9 system to examine if loss of CTCF binding could reverse Ni-induced
persistent transcriptional changes. In Aim 3, we will examine the functional outcome of Ni-induced persistent
transcriptional changes by investigating the tumor generating potential of Ni-exposed cells in in mice. The overall
impact of our study will be the identification of the mechanisms underlying long-term transcriptional changes
caused by nickel exposure, which will reveal the molecular basis of its pathogenicity, and will have major human
health implications.","421631",

strong risk factor for additional cardiovascular events. Currently, there are no therapeutic options for CAVD other
than valve replacement or repair due in part to the incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms.
Interestingly, AV calcification develops in a side-specific manner, occurring preferentially on the fibrosa side
exposed to d-flow while the ventricularis side exposed to stable flow is spared. Another mechanical force,
elevated stretching commonly observed in bicuspid (BAV) and diseased valves and hypertension, also correlates
well with CAVD. These suggest a potential role for d-flow and elevated stretch in the pathogenesis of CAVD, but
the mechanism is unclear. Our goal is to define the role and mechanisms of the mechanical forces in CAVD
pathogenesis and use the knowledge to develop novel anti-CAVD therapeutics. In the previous funding cycle,
we have identified several flow- and side-dependent microRNAs (miRNAs) in human AV endothelial cells
(HAVECs) and pig AVs (PAVs) and began determining their roles in CAVD. Recently, we have identified a novel
flow- and stretch-sensitive miR-483-3p (miR-483), which has exciting potential as a critical regulator of CAVD
pathogenesis. Our preliminary data show that miR-483 expression is decreased 1) by d-flow (OS) compared to
stable flow (LS) in HAVECs, 2) in the fibrosa layer compared to the ventricularis in human and pig AVs, and 3)
by pathological stretch conditions in PAVs ex vivo. Further data indicate that miR-483 inhibits EC inflammation
and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), critical pathobiological events in CAVD, and that a key
gene target of miR-483 is Ube2c (E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), which in turn may target the hypoxia-
inducible factor (HIF1α) via controlling its upstream regulator pVHL. HIF1α's role in CAVD is unclear, but its well-
known target genes include VEGF (angiogenesis and inflammation), TGFβ (fibrosis and calcification), Runx2
(calcification) and Twist1 (EndoMT), key CAVD pathogenic processes. Therefore, our overarching hypothesis is
that miR-483 is an anti-CAVD miRNA, which is reduced under OS/pathological stretch conditions, leading to an
increase in Ube2c, which in turn ubiquitinates pVHL for its degradation and increases the HIF1α level. HIFα,
then, stimulates its target genes leading to inflammation, EndoMT, AV sclerosis and calcification. We will test
this in 3 Aims. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms by which miR-483 regulates shear-dependent responses of
HAVECs and PAVs in a Ube2c- and the HIF1α-dependent manner in vitro and ex vivo. Aim 2 will determine the
role of miR-483 in stretch-dependent calcification of HAVICs and PAVs ex vivo via Ube2c and HIF1α-dependent
mechanisms. Aim 3 is an in vivo study where miR-483, Ube2c, and HIF1α will be modified genetically,
molecularly or pharmacologically in a novel mouse model of CAVD that we just developed by treating GATA5-/-
BAV mice with AAV-PCSK9 to induce hypercholesterolemia. Here, we will test their roles and their anti-CAVD
therapeutic potential.","47015",

common procedures such as corneal transplantation and vision correction. Unfortunately, the
restoration of corneal sensory function after damage is usually inadequate due to aberrant and poor
regeneration of axons. In vascularized tissues, such as the sciatic nerve and spinal cord Schwann
cells (SCs) are known to support axonal regeneration after injury. However, little is known how
corneal SCs respond to injury or surgical procedures as this cell types has not previously been
investigated. Studies performed in sciatic injury models reveal that both the genetic encoded
factors of SCs, as well as the extracellular matrix components govern the axonal repair process.
The dedifferentiation of SCs into a repair SCs – a transient cell type – that re-differentiates into a
terminal SC is a hallmark of SC-driven mechanisms in axonal regeneration. In the cornea, the bulk
of sensory axons are unmyelinated axons, except at the limbus where they are myelinated. It is
presumed that lesions of nonmyelinating corneal axons also enlist the support of their respective
SCs for axonal regeneration, mirroring similar activities of SCs of injured vascularized tissues.
This idea has not been formally tested before, as experimental evidence to support or refute this
paradigm is lacking. To learn what genes are expressed specifically in corneal SCs, we performed
a single cell RNA sequence analysis of the rabbit cornea and identified the corneal SC
transcriptome. With cross-species validation of several SC-specific target proteins in mouse
corneas and validation of a transgenic mouse line expressing proteolipid protein 1-enhanced green
fluorescent protein (Plp1-eGFP), we demonstrated SC-specific reporter gene expression in vivo.
In this exploratory R21 grant, we propose two aims. In specific aim 1, we will exploit the Plp1-
eGFP reporter transgenic line in a corneal stromal injury model causing nerve severance and
investigate corneal SC to myofibroblast differentiation over the course of axonal degeneration and
repair. These studies will help define whether corneal SCs differentiate into myofibroblasts and
nature of injury that promotes this aberrant phenotype. In specific aim 2, we will investigate the
wingless (Wnt) signaling pathway in corneal SCs, as molecular components of this pathway
showed differential high expression in SCs compared to other corneal cells. We plan to investigate
how modulation of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) governs corneal axonal regeneration after
injury and effects on corneal mechanical sensation. Together, these objectives will help to lay
down the foundation to identify novel targets for SC-therapeutics towards improvement of corneal
axonal growth and sensory impairment.","238620",

Osteoblasts are critical components of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche that regulate hematopoiesis.
More recently, they have emerged as critical regulators of the development of hematological myeloid
malignancies. We showed that a single activating mutation in -catenin signaling in osteoblasts is
sufficient to lead to the development of MDS, eventuall progressing to AML in mice. The disease is
transplantable and characterized by clonal evolution at the cytogenetic level. Activated -catenin signaling is
present in osteoblasts of 38% of MDS patients suggesting that this pathway may sustain dysplastic
hematopoiesis and progression to MDS and AML in humans. Our initial observations support this indication
and further suggest a novel means for treating this particular population of patients. In search of a potential
FDA-approved compound with the ability to inhibit -catenin signaling we came across all-trans-retinoic acid
(ATRA). ATRA is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia where its mechanism of action relies
on its ability to dissociate the NCOR-HDACL complex from RAR and allow DNA transcription and
differentiation of the immature leukemic promyelocytes into mature granulocytes. However, reports from in vitro
studies indicate that ATRA has another function: it inhibits -catenin functions. We have found that inhibition of
-catenin signaling in 14 MDS/ patients with active -catenin in their osteoblasts with ATRA improved their
hematologic phenotype, stabilized disease status and inhibited -catenin activity. It also treated MDS and
prevented disease transformation in MDS mice expressing constitutive active -catenin in osteoblasts. Based
on these observations, we hypothesize that interrupting -catenin signaling in osteoblasts of MDS mouse
models and MDS patients with active -catenin in their osteoblasts by pharmacological means will
improve disease outcome. This may be achieved with ATRA, which may find a new use specifically in the
treatment of the portion of MDS patients with activated -catenin in their osteoblasts. To test this hypothesis
we will examine whether ATRA inhibits -catenin-induced MDS in mouse models of activated -catenin in
osteoblasts; and whether this inhibition is independent of actions on HSCs. We will also dissect the molecular
mechanism of -catenin inhibition by ATRA; and, verify the significance and specificity of ATRA inhibition in
cytogenetically different types of human MDS with activated -catenin in osteoblasts in vitro and in xenograft
models we developed to examine interactions between human MDS and stromal cells.","301514",

disease (CD). Although stricture formation is associated with chronic inflammation, no anti-inflammatory
treatment is effective for it, except surgical approaches. However, post-surgery recurrences in the pre-stenotic
region are almost 100%. Studies into the possible role of inflammation-independent mechanisms in fibrosis
and hyperplasia are needed. Mechanical stress (MS) associated with tissue deformation, edema, fibrosis, and
distention are commonly encountered in CD. We hypothesize that MS plays a critical role in fibrosis and
hyperplasia in CD. We found in a well-defined rodent model of CD that intracolonic injection of TNBS induced a
localized transmural inflammation with lumen narrowing in the distal colon and marked distention in the
segment proximal to inflammation. We found that expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in colon smooth muscle cells (SMC) was markedly induced not only
in the inflammation site but in the distended segment proximal to inflammation. We also detected significant
fibrosis and hyperplasia in the inflammation site and the segment proximal to inflammation by 21 days. The
non-distended segment distal to inflammation did not show any increased CTGF and BDNF, or fibrosis and
hyperplasia, indicating a MS dependent mechanism. Furthermore, if mechanical distention was prevented by
feeding rats with only liquid diet, which mimics exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) in CD management,
expression of CTGF and BDNF was dramatically attenuated and fibrosis was significantly improved.
Mechanical stretch in vitro induced expression of CTGF and BDNF in colon SMC, and activated transcription
activator yes-associated protein-1 (YAP). Moreover, YAP activity is found markedly increased in fibrostenotic
CD tissues in humans. We propose that transmural inflammation in CD causes MS in the inflammation site and
the distended segment proximal to inflammation, and the MS induces YAP-dependent mechanosensitive
expression of CTGF and BDNF, which contribute to fibrosis and hyperplasia. The specific aims of the study
are: 1. To determine if MS plays a role in intestinal fibrosis and SMC hyperplasia in CD. We will differentiate
the effect of MS from inflammation by assessing site-specific changes of fibrosis, SMC growth, and expression
of CTGF and BDNF in the site of inflammation (with both inflammation and MS), the segments proximal (with
MS) and distal (with neither inflammation nor MS) to the inflammation site in the CD model. The role of MS in
ECM production and SMC hyperplasia will be further assessed in CD without MS (rats fed with liquid diet) and
in a model with MS only (mechanical obstruction). 2. To investigate the signaling mechanisms of MS-induced
YAP activation and YAP-dependent expression of CTGF and BDNF. 3. To examine the pathogenic roles of
YAP mediated mechanosensitive expression of CTGF and BDNF in fibrosis and hyperplasia. The possible
cooperation between inflammation and MS in fibrosis and hyperplasia will be investigated as well.","319950",

Persistent pain, particularly at rest, profoundly affects quality of life and daily physical activity, especially in the
elderly population. Pain itself is a risk factor for the development of future functional decline. Moreover,
decrease in mobility in turn significantly increases the risk of many chronic diseases. Low back pain (LBP) is
an extremely common health problem and affects roughly 80% of people during their life course and is the
leading cause of activity limitation and work absence. Thus, spinal degeneration with LBP is one of the most
prevalent diseases leading to a decline in mobility and frailty. Unfortunately, we still do not understand the
source of LBP and there is no effective disease-modified therapy.
Spinal amphiarthrodial joints are recognized as a functional unit, each of which exhibit unique responses to
mechanical loading and degenerate with aging. Especially, vertebral endplates undergo ossification and
become porous under unbalance mechanical forces or during aging. We have previously found a large number
of osteoclasts in the porous sclerotic endplates in LBP patients and aged mice (spinal hypersensitivity model),
suggesting active bone remodeling in endplates. We have also identified that over 70% of these osteoclasts
are senescent cells, which have been reported to lead to age associated tissue dysfunction. Moreover, clinical
and rodent animal studies demonstrated that nerve density was higher in porous endplates than that in normal
endplates in LBP patients and animal models, suggesting that the aberrantly innervated endplates may be a
source of LBP in patients and spinal hypersensitivity in mice. We have recently shown that osteoclasts secrete
Netrin-1, an axonal guidance molecule, to induce sensory nerve axonal growth in the endplates. Reduction of
osteoclasts inhibited the sensory innervation into endplates. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that during
bone remodeling, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) activates its EP4 receptor on sensory nerves to decrease
sympathetic tone, which induced osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells. Our pilot data
showed senescent osteoclasts, PGE2 and Netrin-1 levels were significantly increased in porous endplates.
Therefore, we are in a unique position to determine the role of sensory nerve dysregulation of the vertebral
endplate as the driver of spinal functional unit degeneration with aging. We hypothesize that elevated PGE2
concentrations and sensory innervation in the porous EP induced by senescent OCs and their
secretion of excessive Netrin-1 mediate spinal hypersensitivity in mice (LBP in patients). Specifically,
we will first determine the effect of osteoclastic SnCs on spinal hypersensitivity (Aim 1). We will next
investigate the mechanism of sensory innervation by senescent osteoclast-produced Netrin-1 in porous
endplates (Aim 2). We will finally examine if the elevated PGE2 level in porous endplates induce spinal
hypersensitivity during spine degeneration (Aim 3)."," ",

the lysosomal enzyme, galactosyl-ceramidase (GALC). In the absence of GALC activity a highly cytotoxic
lipid, galactosyl-sphingosine (psychosine, Psy) accumulates and preferentially causes the death of
oligodendrocytes. Krabbe disease affects the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS) leading to
irritability, sensory deterioration, motor defects, seizures, and cognitive deficits beginning at 6 months of age
and death occurs by 2-5 years of age. There is currently no effective therapy for Krabbe disease. In
addition, all the evidence from years of research in authentic animal models of Krabbe disease shows that no
single treatment provides meaningful long-term benefits. However, we recently showed that a combination
therapy approach that simultaneously targets the primary pathogenic mechanism (GALC deficiency) and
secondary consequences of GALC deficiency (psychosine accumulation, inflammation, etc) dramatically and
synergistically increases efficacy. Although Krabbe disease was described over 100 years ago and the murine
model has been available for nearly 40 years, we know surprisingly little about the pathogenesis of the
disease. This is largely to the confounding effects of cross-correction. We have created a chimeric form of
GALC that retains enzyme activity, prevents the accumulation of psychosine and is incapable of cross-
correcting surrounding cells. This novel reagent will now enable us to determine both the contribution of cross-
correction to various therapeutic strategies and the role of specific cell types in the pathogenesis of Krabbe
disease. The goals of this proposal are to 1) determine the efficacy of newly developed substrate reduction
therapy drugs alone and in combination, 2) determine the mechanism/s by which certain therapies interact to
synergistically increase efficacy, 3) determine the role of specific cell types in the pathogenesis of Krabbe
disease, and 4) determine the mechanism/s by which psychosine is generated and potentially uncover a new

Metastatic prostate cancer is incurable. Defining the key contributors to metastatic progression within the primary
tumor will have broad implications for clinically translatable targets for both the early identification of who is at
risk for metastatic cancer and for the treatment of cancer. In patient based data, we have identified germline
variants in the length of the aspartate (D) repeat domain of Asporin (ASPN) that are either associated with (D14)
or are protective of (D13) metastatic development. We reported that opposed to being expressed in cancer cells,
ASPN expression is highly enriched in cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and its expression is significantly
associated with local cancer aggressiveness as measured by Gleason grade. Consistent with patient-based
data, in vivo models of tumor-stromal interactions, support that expression in the tumor microenvironment of
ASPN D14 drives while ASPN D13 restricts metastatic development. Our data suggest that ASPN has potential
clinical utility to better stratify disease aggressiveness for treatment decision making and may also be a potential
therapeutic target due to its extracellular expression in the tumor microenvironment. Despite its high potential for
clinical significance, the role of ASPN in local tumor aggressiveness or metastatic development has not been
fully determined. Furthermore, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which ASPN regulates metastatic
progression are also incompletely defined. However, our preliminary data suggest that ASPN may regulate
pluripotency and self-renewal of CAF progenitors, which may be a key mechanism for how ASPN regulates local
progression and metastatic potential. Based on these new findings, we aim to identify the mechanisms by which
ASPN regulates tumor progression. Our central hypothesis is that ASPN maintains CAF progenitors, and
thereby ASPN potentiates CAF-induced invasion and progression to metastasis. We further hypothesize
that the length of the D-repeat domain in ASPN affects its mechanistic and cellular functions and
ultimately its impact on metastatic development. Our goals are 1) to determine the contribution of ASPN to
primary tumor growth and metastatic development in autochthonous animal models, and to delineate the 2)
cellular and 3) molecular based mechanisms by which ASPN D14 promotes and ASPN D13 restricts tumor
progression and metastatic-invasion of prostate cancer. We propose to comprehensively examine the role of
ASPN in local cancer aggressiveness and metastatic development using novel in vivo animal models, cutting
edge in vitro assays, and patient-based data. Successful completion of these aims will provide critical information
on how ASPN regulates metastatic development, and will therefore provide opportunities for translating these
findings for prognosis and therapy.","344692",

Summary
 Programmed cell death (PCD) plays important role in normal biology, and its deregulation contributes to the
development of various diseases. Ferroptosis is a PCD modality driven by cellular metabolism and iron-
dependent cellular lipid peroxidation. Mounting evidence indicates that ferroptosis is involved in multiple
pathological conditions, including cancer. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of ferroptosis is important
for both fundamental biology and disease treatment.
 While most mechanistic investigation of ferroptosis focuses on intracellular molecular events, our recent
studies revealed a conceptually novel mechanism for ferroptosis regulation that is non-cell autonomous: in
epithelial cells, E-cadherin-mediated intercellular interaction suppresses ferroptosis through intracellular
Merlin/NF2-Hippo signaling; antagonizing this signaling axis unleashes the activity of the proto-oncogenic
transcriptional co-activator YAP to promote ferroptosis through regulating multiple ferroptosis modulators. As E-
cadherin and Hippo-YAP signaling are key regulators of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), our work
provides mechanistic insights into the recently published observation that mesenchymal and metastatic
properties of cancer cells are highly correlated with the sensitivity of cancer cells to ferroptosis induction. Our
preliminary studies furthersuggest that malignant mutation of E-cadherin and multiple components in the Merlin-
Hippo-YAP signaling pathway can be used as biomarkers predicting cancer cell responsiveness to future
ferroptosis-inducing therapies. Considering that loss of function mutations of tumor suppressors E-cadherin,
NF2, and Lat1/2 (components of Hippo signaling), as well as super-activation of YAP oncoprotein, are all
malignant events that make cancer cells more resistant to common therapies and to apoptotic cell death, our
finding that these same mutations instead render cancer cells more sensitive to ferroptosis induction is
unexpected and highly important both conceptually and clinically.
 Based on these preliminary results, in this proposal, (1) intercellularly, we will investigate the molecular
basis underlying the role of E-cadherin in transducing signals into the intracellular machinery, thus functioning
as both a tumor suppressor and counter-intuitively, an inhibitor of ferroptosis; to further expand this concept, we
will determine if other cell adhesion molecules can also regulate ferroptosis via similar mechanism; (2)
intracellularly, we will determine how YAP dictates ferroptosis sensitivity via its transcription co-regulating
activity; and (3) relevant to cancer, as E-cadherin mutation is highly frequent in gastric cancer, a fatal disease
currently without effective treatment, we will investigate the role of E-cadherin tumor suppressor in determining
gastric cancer cell sensitivity to ferroptosis, and the potential role of E-cadherin-regulated ferroptosis in gastric
cancer metastasis. Genetically engineered mouse models for gastric cancer, as well as gastric cancer patient-
derived tumor organoids and xenograft mouse models, will be used for this preclinical investigation. Taken
together, success of the proposed research will unveil in-depth mechanisms of ferroptosis, as well as its
functional communication with various cancer-relevant intercellular and intracellular molecular events. The
proposed research will also lead to the identification of biomarkers that predict cancer responsiveness to future
ferroptosis-inducing cancer therapy.","452635",

Biliary fibrosis is a process of peri-portal scarring within the liver that is caused by diseased bile ducts and

understanding how epigenetic dysregulation in bile duct cells (cholangiocytes) leads to the release of

Cholestatic fibrogenesis is a pathobiological process of the bile ducts, characterized by biliary strictures,
cholestasis, and progressive peri-portal fibrosis. During biliary fibrosis, diseased cholangiocytes become
highly secretory, releasing a variety of paracrine signaling molecules that subsequently activate hepatic
stellate cells (HSC). Progression toward end stage disease is characterized by an exaggerated fibrogenic
response to chronic injury, culminating in peri-portal deposition of matrix molecules that progresses to
biliary cirrhosis. The release of paracrine, cholangiocyte-derived factors that subsequently activate hepatic
stellate cells (HSC) is an early, important, and potentially reversible step in the progression of biliary
fibrosis. Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) is a key epigenetic regulator that enzymatically mediates
the tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) to silence transcription. Our novel line of
investigation proposes that, in normal cholangiocytes, transcription of HSC-activating genes is
homeostatically silenced by EZH2. We also propose that the p300 acetyltransferase can lead to H3K27
acetylation (H3K27ac) to initiate transcription. We have generated the following novel preliminary data: 1)
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq have identified a network of cholangiocyte-derived paracrine activators of HSCs,
including fibronectin (FN), that are silenced by EZH2; 2) TGF-β induces loss of silencing through
proteasomal degradation of EZH2; 3) Human livers with biliary fibrosis demonstrate accumulation of p300
and H3K27ac along with peri-portal deposition of FN; 4) p300 forms a transcription factor complex
downstream of TGF-β and leads to H3K27ac on the FN promoter; and 5) Genetic or pharmacologic
inhibition of EZH2 in vivo leads to exaggerated fibrosis in mouse models of biliary disease. Based on this
preliminary data, we propose the central hypothesis that changes in H3K27me3 and H3K27ac,
epigenetically initiate fibrogenic cross talk between cholangiocytes and HSC. In Aim I, we will test the
subhypothesis that EZH2 leads to homeostatic silencing of FN and other gene targets through H3K27
methylation and this process is regulated by TGF-β through proteasomal degradation of EZH2. In Aim II,
we will evaluate the subhypothesis that a p300 complex downstream of TGF-β activates FN transcription
through H3K27 acetylation and promotes paracrine HSC activation. In Aim III, we will investigate the
subhypothesis that reciprocal regulation at H3K27 by EZH2 and p300 controls cholangiocyte FN
deposition, HSC activation, and biliary fibrosis in vivo. The significance of these studies lies in the novel
concept that epigenetic regulators allow specific membrane signals in cholangiocytes to re-write the
histone code and generate fibrogenic paracrine molecules that subsequently promote HSC activation. In
turn, interventions targeting these newly discovered pathways with epigenetic pharmacology may have the
capability to prevent or reverse the extracellular matrix events that drive biliary fibrosis.","321975",

subpopulation of highly migratory premalignant airway epithelial cells that were observed to migrate through
microscale constrictions at up to 100-fold the rate of the control unselected cells. These highly migratory cells
demonstrate enhanced metastatic behavior in vivo. We isolated and characterized exosomes from these highly
migratory premalignant human airway epithelial cells, as well as, malignant pleural effusion (MPE)-derived
metastatic cancer cells. In both settings of premalignancy and metastatic disease, exosomes containing unique
omic signatures transferred the metastatic phenotype to non-motile cells. From these signatures, we have
identified potential candidates mediating the transfer of metastatic behavior and immunosuppression. To
facilitate the study of metastatic disease, we will utilize our MPE-biobank for exosome isolation and
characterization from individual patient's MPE-derived metastatic lung cancer cells. While exosomes are known
to serve as functional mediators in cell interaction leading to cancer metastasis, this will be the first
comprehensive study to fully characterize the mechanisms underlying these events in the context of pulmonary
premalignant migration, as well as, in the context of metastatic cells from MPEs. In order to characterize and
understand the mechanisms of this process in regulating the promotion of migratory capacity and
immunosuppression in premalignant and metastatic lung cancer cells we will: 1) Determine the capacity of
exosomes to drive disease progression across the spectrum of disease in NSCLC by characterizing the
exosomal cargo derived from premalignant and metastatic cancer cells, 2) Determine the mechanisms of
exosome-dependent promotion of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migratory capacity of epithelial
and lung cancer cells and, 3) determine the mechanisms of exosome-dependent immune suppression. While

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by elevated lung pressures,
right heart failure, and premature death. Current therapies fail to prevent disease progression due to their inability
to suppress and/or reverse pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) driven muscularization of distal
microvessels. The origin of these highly proliferative PASMCs remains incompletely understood, but may be
closely related to the maladaptive behavior of contiguous pericyte (PC) populations. In addition to providing
mural support to capillaries, PCs can differentiate into other cell types in response to stress. We recently reported
that human PAH lung PCs share lineage markers and functional properties with PASMCs, such as morphology
and contractility. We thus hypothesize that PASMCs in PAH vascular lesions originate from capillary PCs.
Fate-mapping of PCs in chronic hypoxia mice revealed that PCs dissociate from capillaries and relocate to
precapillary arterioles, where they co-express markers of mature SMCs and contribute to muscularization.
Through single cell and bulk RNA-seq analysis, we discovered that the HIF2A/SDF1 signaling pathway is a
master regulator of differentiation of PCs into SMC and a major modifier of PC dysfunction in PAH. We
propose to: 1) demonstrate that HIF2a/SDF1 activation causes PC dissociation from pulmonary capillaries, 2)
define the molecular mechanism by which HIF2a/SDF1 signaling drives PC differentiation into PASMC-like in
human and mice, and 3) determine whether manipulation of HIF2a/SDF1 in PCs can alter the severity of vascular
remodeling in animal models of PH. This project will provide novel insight into pericyte pathobiology and establish
HIF2a/SDF1 as a potential therapeutic target in PAH, for which the first drugs to reverse muscularization and
improve outcomes in PAH may be found.","398250",

 Hypospadias is a birth defect wherein the urethral opening is displaced from the distal end of the penis
and instead terminates on the ventral side of the penis, or in severe cases, on the scrotum or perineum.
Hypospadias is one of the most common birth defects, affecting approximately 1 in 125 live male births.
Surgery is currently the only treatment, which comes with a risk of complications and recurrence. Recent work
has demonstrated that both genetic factors and environmental factors such as embryonic exposure to
endocrine disrupting chemicals can increase the rate of hypospadias. Despite these studies, we still do not
have a good grasp on what aspects of genitalia morphogenesis become disrupted and result in hypospadias.
 The embryonic genital tubercle (GT) gives rise to either the penis or clitoris, and contains tissues from
all three germ layers. The endodermal component of the GT primarily gives rise to the urethra, mesodermal
cells contribute to supportive structures within the external genitalia, and the ectoderm gives rise to the
overlying skin. During GT development, the endoderm and ectoderm are connected at an endoderm/ectoderm
junction (EEJ) on the ventral side of the GT, forming one of very few sites in the body where such a junction
occurs. This junction is remodeled away over the course of penis development and urethral internalization,
leading to distal positioning of the urethral meatus; the EEJ remains intact during and after clitoral
development, resulting in the ventral position of the urethral opening between the clitoris and vagina. This
leads to the hypothesis that EEJ remodeling is necessary for urethral internalization in the penis, and
disruptions to the EEJ cause hypospadias. To test this hypothesis, this proposal uses mouse mutants in the
Fgf signaling pathway as a model to test how disruptions of the EEJ result in GT malformations: mice with
Fgfr2 mutations display endodermal and ectodermal defects in the GT and subsequently develop severe
hypospadias. Aim 1 of this proposal will test how Fgfr2 regulates cell movements at the EEJ during urethral
internalization; this aim makes use of a novel GT organ culture system coupled with four-dimensional live
imaging techniques to directly visualize morphogenesis of the mouse EEJ. Aim 2 will examine the
biomechanical mechanisms underlying urethral internalization and test the role of extracellular matrix adhesion
in contributing to EEJ development.
 The findings from this proposal will generate an atlas of the cell and tissue movements which occur
during urethral formation in the mouse, a resource which is not available for most mammalian organ systems.
The research proposed here will not only shine a light onto the morphogenetic mechanisms underlying normal
external genitalia development, but will also provide insight into how hypospadias arise and will help shape
potential preventative measures for this common congenital defect.","67446",

Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) still lack effective targeted therapy, despite the fact that TNBC often
presents as invasive diseases with poor outcome. Subtypes of TNBC show rare or low pathological complete
response (pCR) rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapies. Despite the newly acquired tumor genomics data,
readily actionable, therapy-effective targets are yet to be revealed or established.
Our recent data mining and other tumor analysis revealed that RORC/RORγ, an orphan member of the
nuclear receptor family of transcription factors, is amplified or overexpressed in over 30% of TNBC and that its
overexpression is significantly associated with poor outcomes. Our functional studies revealed that it is
required for growth and survival of TNBC cells, and that its inhibitors, developed recently by us, are highly
effective in killing TNBC cells selectively and stopping tumor growth and metastasis at relatively low doses,
without overt toxicity. With other preliminary studies, we hypothesize that overexpression and/or
hyperactivation of RORγ drives TNBC progression through a novel cholesteromic feed-forward loop and that
targeting RORγ with a potent tumor-selective, small-molecule inhibitor, either alone or in combination with
chemotherapy, can be a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for TNBC. The hypothesis will be tested in 3
specific aims: Aim 1 will establish that overexpressed RORγ drives tumor growth and therapeutic resistance
through its function in reprogramming lipid/cholesterol metabolism; Aim 2 will establish that induction of an
epigenetic switch underlies the superior anti-TNBC potency of the RORγ inhibitor, and Aim 3 will thoroughly
examine the anti-tumor efficacy of the optimized inhibitor using PDX and other tumor models. Successful
completion of the proposed studies should, for the first time, establish RORγ as a new, major driver of TNBC
and effective therapeutic target.","406082",

including breast cancers caused by amplification of the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase HER2
(HER2+ BC). In metastatic HER2+ BC, however, resistance occurs even to combinations of anti-cancer
drugs, and preventing its emergence is essential for converting remissions to cures. “Drug-tolerant persisters”
(DTPs) survive exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and other anti-neoplastics in a non-proliferative,
quiescent (dormant) state via reversible, non-genetic mechanisms. DTPs are implicated in resistance of
EGFRmut non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), BRAFmut melanoma, and other cancers, but a potential role in
in HER2+ BC had not been explored thoroughly. We found that HER2+ BC lines treated with HER2-TKIs
(lapatinib, tucatinib) give rise to two types of DTPs, which have luminal or mesenchymal transcriptomes. As
in other cell lines, a fraction of HER2+ BC cells transit stochastically through G0 after exiting mitosis, instead
of proceeding directly into G1. Remarkably, luminal DTPs arose uniquely from these transient G0 cells (“pre-
DTPs”), which also express a subset of DTP genes. HER2+ BCs are highly proliferative, yet like other tumors,
they also have significant numbers of G0 (Ki67-) cells, and our initial analyses of samples from TKI-treated
HER2+ BC patients comport with DTP generation from G0 cells. Thus, in contrast to current models, which
contend that the drug-tolerant, quiescent state is induced by TKIs and other targeted
therapies/chemotherapies, our data indicate that pre-DTPs might already be present in the drug-naïve
population.
 We hypothesize that the chromatin of such transient, G0/pre-DTP cells has a globally distinct
organization that primes them to induce the complete DTP transcriptome and become drug-tolerant upon
TKI exposure. Whether this “G0 selection/induction” model applies to mesenchymal-like HER2+ DTPs, DTPs
induced by other agents, and/or more broadly to bona fide HER2 tumors remains unclear. Because DTPs
comprise a potential cellular reservoir for seeding stable resistance to HER2 TKIs and other
targeted/conventional therapies, delineating their ontogenetic mechanisms could reveal novel cancer
vulnerabilities and ultimately, new therapies. Our focus on the unique features of gene regulation in G0 cells
could also have implications for tumor dormancy. This proposal joins experts in epigenetics/chromosome
organization (SKOK) and cancer biology/cell signaling (NEEL) to address these timely, relevant questions
Specifically, we will: (1) Characterize chromatin architecture and gene regulation in HER2-TKI pre-DTPs and
DTPs from luminal-like HER2+ BC lines, (2) Test the hypothesis that HER2-TKI DTPs from mesenchymal
HER2+ BC lines also arise from G0-like pre-DTPs and have condensin II-organized chromatin, and (3) Test
the pathophysiological significance of lapatinib DTPs in in vivo models of HER2-TKI DTPs.","702264",

Bone disorders and deformities are prevalent in children and young adults. Due to lack of effective modalities
to regenerate growing bones, these young patients often undergo multiple surgical interventions, posing a
significant burden on them, their family and society. During bone growth, chondrocytes and osteoblasts are
continuously generated to make bones bigger and stronger. Endogenous bone stem cells that serve as the
source of these cells have not been completely understood. Fundamental knowledge of how these bone stem
cells coordinate the two processes of endochondral and intramembranous ossification is essential to develop a
reliable approach to regenerate growing bones. In this project, the characteristics of distinct types of bone stem
cells that actively promote bone growth will be identified. We hypothesize that a subset of resting chondrocytes
in the postnatal growth plate behave as growth-associated bone stem cells, and become a source of
mesenchymal stromal progenitor cells in bone marrow; these two types of bone stem/progenitor cells
concertedly promote proper bone growth and maintenance. Identifying characteristics and molecular
regulations of bone stem cells will facilitate our endeavor to reproduce these cells through regenerative
engineering. In Aim1, we will identify molecular mechanisms regulating properties and fates of resting
chondrocytes. The working hypothesis is that resting chondrocytes of the postnatal growth plate exhibit unique
characteristics as growth-associated bone stem cells, whose properties and fates are regulated by Hedgehog
signaling. We will first identify a self-renewing multipotent subpopulation of resting chondrocytes using in vitro
colony-forming assays and in vivo transplantation of isolated growth plate cells. We will second identify the
unique gene expression profiles of self-renewing colony-forming resting chondrocytes. We will further define
roles of Hedgehog signaling in determining self-renewal and differentiation of resting chondrocytes by
modulating its signaling components, while simultaneously tracing their behavior both in vivo and in vitro. In
Aim2, we will define formation and fates of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal progenitors in growing bones.
The working hypothesis is that growth plate chondrocytes undergo hypertrophy and transform into Cxcl12-
abundant reticular (CAR) cells in bone marrow that behave as regional and reactive mesenchymal stromal
progenitor cells. We will first define differentiation potentials of CAR cells into osteoblasts and adipocytes in
vivo through intermittent PTH administration and a high-fat diet containing rosiglitazone. We will second
determine CAR cells' response to injury using a semistabilized tibial fracture model. We will also identify effects
of these manipulations on CAR cells' expression levels of key transcription factors that regulate cell fate choice.
We will third define the properties of CAR cells as mesenchymal stromal progenitors through in vitro colony-
forming assays and in vivo transplantation of isolated bone marrow cells. We will further define roles of β-
catenin signaling as a cell fate determinant of osteoblast versus adipocyte differentiation using its floxed allele.","333450",

Additionally, the
need to properly form bone is vital to successful outcomes from surgeries ranging from joint replacement to
spinal fusion to dental implants. In an aging population, the biomedical need is even greater. The recent
identification of skeletal progenitor cells, composed of 8 subpopulations, capable of forming all three
components of the skeleton, bone, cartilage and stroma, promises to have a major impact on improving the
outcomes for these therapies. A key question that remains is what are the factors affecting eventual cell fate of
these skeletal progenitor cells. Our data on the matricellular protein DEL1 have shown it has an impact on
skeletal repair. We have preliminary data indicating that it has a direct effect on skeletal progenitor cell biology
and we propose that DEL1 plays an important role in their biology.
 Prior to this, our data had shown DEL1 had a biological effect on chondrocytes, but not on osteoblasts. We
demonstrated decreased numbers of mouse skeletal stem cells (mSSCs), and bone, cartilage, stroma
progenitors (BCSPs), the skeletal progenitor most important in fracture healing in the fracture callus, and we
propose the mechanism for decreased bone formation after fracture is due to an effect on skeletal progenitors
ability to expand after fracture. We plan on examining this first by isolating mSSCs and BCSPs, from knockout
(KO) and wild type (WT) mice and comparing their biology. We will examine the biology of BCSPs using in vitro
assays for cell proliferation, osteogenic and chondrogenic potential. BCSPs develop a different phenotype
termed the fracture BCSP (f-BCSP) that has greater proliferative ability and osteogenic potential after fracture,
and we will test whether the same change occurs in our KO mice. We will perform in vivo assays for
osteogenesis by implanting BCSPs into the renal capsule to examine how well they form bone.
 A key question in understanding how DEL1 affects formation of bone after fracture is to understand what
happens to skeletal progenitors after fracture in WT and KO mice. We will use lineage tracing techniques with
mice currently in our laboratory to examine the fate of daughter cells from individual clones of skeletal
progenitors cells.
 The final series of experiments represent our initial approaches to translating use of DEL1 into potential
therapies. First, we will perform a carefully controlled microarray experiment to identify pathways altered in KO
skeletal progenitors compared to WT. We will examine the ability of exogenous DEL1 to promote viability and
growth of skeletal stem cells grown in vitro. We will test the ability of DEL1 to stimulate bone and cartilage
formation of skeletal progenitor cells implanted into the renal capsule. Finally, we will examine whether
exogenous DEL1 protein placed at a fracture site can enhance normal fracture healing. We will also use a
separate model of poor fracture healing with mice that have undergone hindlimb irradiation.
 In summary, we will examine how Del1 affects the biology of skeletal progenitor cells. In addition to
providing steps to potentially translate these discoveries into therapies, these experiments can provide us with
mechanistic answers about how lack of Del1 leads to decreased bone in fracture healing. They will provide
insight into the factors that affect the potential fate of skeletal progenitor cells."," ",

Malignant gliomas continue to be the most aggressive and lethal of all brain tumors. In spite of improvements in
surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, median survival remains ~18-24 months. Gliomas are infiltrative
tumors that invade the surrounding normal brain tissue making total surgical resection impossible. Tumor cells
that remain after surgery eventually lead to tumor recurrence, causing the demise of the patients. Collagen
plays an important role in the progression of various tumors such as breast, prostate and pancreatic tumors. Its
role in gliomas, however, remains poorly understood. Cellular, molecular and functional preliminary data have
identified Collagen1A1 (Col1A1) as an important determinant of tumor progression and invasion. An important
role of Col1A1 in patient survival is supported by the analysis of TCGA, and GLASS, data from human primary
and recurrent gliomas that indicate that median survival is inversely correlated with levels of Col1A1. Human
and experimental mouse gliomas contain fascicles of elongated mesenchymal-like tumor cells that represent
areas of collective motion within the tumor invasive border, and the tumor core; an increase in the density of
these areas is associated with worse prognosis in preclinical mouse models and in human patients. scRNAseq
followed by RNAscope identified two types of cells that express significant levels of Col1A1. High Col1A1-
expressing cells are found within perivascular stroma cells, and glioma cells themselves express lower, but
significant levels of Col1A1. Using laser-microdissection of the mesenchymal-like structures followed by
RNAseq we confirmed that areas of collective motion are enriched in mesenchymal markers such as Col1A1
and ACTA2. These experiments predict an important role for Col1A1 in tumor progression. This was examined
by expressing a shRNA for Col1A1 during the induction of genetically engineered mouse models of glioma
(GEMMs) using our Sleeping Beauty system. Indeed, knockdown of Col1A1 from tumor cells from incipient
GEMMs increased median survival and eliminated areas of fascicles of elongated mesenchymal-like tumor
cells; however, tumors still progressed, animals became moribund, and perivascular expression of Col1A1
remained. This raises the possibility that expression of Col1A1 in perivascular stromal cells plays an important
role in glioma progression. What is not known is if Col1A1 depletion from either tumor or perivascular stromal
cells within established tumors will delay tumor progression and reduce collective motion. Thus, there is a
critical need for a mechanistic understanding of how Col1A1 contributes to glioma progression and invasion.
Our overall objectives are to establish the role of each cellular compartment that expresses Col1A1 on glioma
growth and invasion (AIM 1), the functional role of Col1A1 expression in either cellular compartment on glioma
dynamics (AIM 2), and the role of collagen and its receptors on the response of gliomas to radiation (AIM 3).
Our central hypothesis is that Col1A1 expressing cells play a significant role in glioma progression and
invasion and that blocking Col1A1 and/or its receptors could uncover a novel therapeutic target for GBM.","529012",

Bacterial pneumonia kills more than one million infants around the world each year. Type 3 innate
lymphoid cells (ILC3) are critical for lung mucosal defense against bacterial pneumonia in the
newborns. However, the signals that guide pulmonary ILC3s development are incompletely
understood. A wave of ILC3s accumulate into the newborn lungs during the first week of life
contemporaneous with postnatal lung growth and colonization by commensal microbiota. Clinical
interventions in premature infants, for instance, the use of antibiotics alter microbiota and are
associated with decreased lung ILC3s and increased risk of pneumonia. Similarly, therapies such as
mechanical ventilation and corticosteroids interrupt the postnatal lung growth leading to
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Infants with BPD have decreased lung ILC3 and increased
likelihood of morbidity due to respiratory infections. Therefore, understanding this relationship is
clinically important. In published studies, we found that ILC3s localized to the alveoli in the newborn
lungs, where they intimately associated with a subset of Gli1+ stromal cells creating a pulmonary ILC3
niche. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)1 was an essential component of the pulmonary ILC3 niche. We
found that developmental signals operating in the niche cells instructed the differentiation and
functional fitness of lung ILC3. The convergence of postnatal lung growth and colonization by
commensal microbiota during the `critical window' of the newborn period allows the developing lung
and evolving microbiota to `instruct' rapidly maturing pulmonary mucosal defenses. Such convergence
ensures long-lasting protection against respiratory pathogens. We hypothesize that carefully timed
signals from commensal bacteria act cooperatively with developmentally programmed cues in the
unique lung niches to pattern the immune environment in the lung. The proposed studies will resolve
the following knowledge gaps regarding lung ILC3 development. 1) When is the lung ILC3 niche
endowed during development and how is it maintained throughout childhood (Aim 1)? 2) How does
ILC3 niche instruct the development, differentiation and functional fitness of lung ILC3 (Aim 2) ? 3)
How does the lung niche integrate the signals from commensal bacteria (Aim 3)?
Together, these aims will use developmentally appropriate models to answer a vital and unknown
question: how the newborn's lungs are seeded with ILC3 and how they are regulated at their lung niches
via local and extrapulmonary inputs throughout childhood.","440745",

The kidney performs a vital role in filtering waste products from the bloodstream and directing urine through a

of all birth defects that involve the kidney and urinary tract. This project proposes to use engineered tissues to

Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) account for ~50% of childhood chronic
kidney disease cases. Many CAKUT defects involve imprecise sizing or spacing of kidney collecting duct
structures, such as duplicated ureters, cystic collecting ducts, and renal hypoplasia, which can lead to severe
health problems including end-stage kidney disease. As such, there is a critical need to understand how
developmental processes promote proper sizing, spacing, and positioning of kidney structures, so that CAKUT
defects can be corrected. Kidney development begins through tree-like outgrowth of the ureteric bud
epithelium (the future collecting duct network) into a loose connective tissue or mesenchyme. Precisely
positioning ureteric bud tubules within this network requires tight control of Ret kinase signaling. Ret responds
to secreted glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) from surrounding mesenchymal cells and mutations
that affect Ret-GDNF signaling cause CAKUT defects. While Ret-GDNF signaling drives the proliferative
expansion of ureteric bud epithelial cells, emerging evidence suggests that “planar cell polarity” (PCP) – a
mechanism by which cells sense their planar positions within sheets and tubes – controls the shape of the
collecting duct network. Significantly, recent findings indicate that mesenchymal cells expressing the PCP
genes Fat4 and Dchs1 prevent improper ureteric bud branching and mutations in these genes cause CAKUT
defects in mice and humans. However, it is unclear how interfaces between PCP-expressing mesenchymal
cells and Ret-expressing epithelial cells enforce the precise sizing and spacing of collecting duct tubules and
avoid defects. The objective of this proposal is to create controlled spatial interfaces between PCP-expressing
cells and Ret-expressing cells and study their impact on Ret-GDNF signaling levels and the resultant effect on
the size and shape of epithelial structures. Aim 1 of this proposal establishes a DNA-based cell patterning
technology that enables the production of cell interfaces in engineered tissues. This cell patterning technology
will be used to create interfaces between PCP-expressing cells and Ret-expressing cells. Cells expressing
fluorescence-based kinase activity reporters and mathematical modeling will be used to study how these
spatial interfaces influence Ret-GDNF signaling. Aim 2 of this proposal will pattern the two cell types in 3D
tissue scaffolds and study the effects of interfaces on the size and shape of resulting epithelial structures. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that PCP-expressing cells locally restrict Ret-GDNF-driven epithelial
tissue growth at interfaces, thereby producing structures of defined size and shape. Together, the approaches
developed in this proposal will improve our understanding of the cellular mechanisms that cause CAKUT
defects and create new tools to build defined tissue structures in organoid models of human disease.","68562",

Age is a significant risk factor for the development of cancer. The mechanisms that drive this risk are complex
and involve both the accumulation of cell autonomous mutations within incipient tumor cells and pro-tumorigenic
changes in the tumor microenvironment. Investigation into the impact of an aging microenvironment on
tumorigenesis has revealed that senescent stromal cells can directly stimulate preneoplastic and neoplastic
growth. Because senescent cells accumulate with age, these observations raise the possibility that senescent
cells are an important contributor to age-related increases in tumorigenesis. To understand how senescent
stromal cells contribute to tumorigenesis, we developed the FASST mouse (Fibroblasts Accelerate Stromal-
Supported Tumorigenesis) that allows us to control the spatial and temporal activation of senescence in
mesenchymal cells. Using this mouse, we found that senescent mouse skin fibroblasts (MSFs) support increased
tumorigenesis in immunocompetent mice. Strikingly, we found that MSFs that arise independently of neoplastic
cells mediate their pro-tumorigenic properties by modulating the host immune system and creating
immunosuppression that limits CD8 T cell activity, thus allowing increased tumor growth. Previous work has
focused on the ability of senescent fibroblasts to directly stimulate tumor cell growth. Thus our work is the first to
show that senescent MSFs can promote tumor growth by modulating the immune system. Because we find that
senescent MSFs in our model cause localized recruitment of immunosuppressive cells, similar to what we find in
aging human skin, we propose that they contribute to age-related increases in tumorigenesis by creating regions
of local immune suppression that shelter incipient tumor cells and allow their outgrowth. To understand the
dynamics of immune modulation in the FASST model, we propose to determine the temporal pattern of immune
cell infiltration, the mechanisms that drive immune cell infiltration, and the senescence-specific factors that drive
the development and maintenance of the suppressive microenvironment present in the FASST mouse. Further
we propose to examine the impact of senescent stromal cells on a spontaneous model of squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC, K14-HPV16) where 100% of animals develop hyperplasia yet only 20% convert to SCC. Here
we propose that the activation of senescence within the stromal compartment will increase the penetrance in this
model by altering the immune landscape. Finally, we will ask how p38MAPK-dependent senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP) factors contribute to the immunosuppressive environment created by senescent
stromal cells and ask in a preclinical setting if targeting p38MAPK or its downstream kinase MK2 is a valid
approach to reducing senescent stromal-supported tumorigenesis. Data from this proposal will provide vital
mechanistic insight and novel therapeutic targets that may reduce age-related increases in cancer.","321458",

 Myocardial infarction (MI) induces the massive death of cardiomyocytes. Quiescent cardiac fibroblasts
(CFs) are rapidly activated after MI. They proliferate and differentiate into cardiac myofibroblasts (CMFs),
mediating cardiac fibrosis. We recently found that in more stabilized infarct scar CMFs further differentiate into
matrifibrocytes, a state resembling partially differentiated chondrocytes, which indicated an advanced level of
fibrosis. The post-MI fibrotic response in the heart stabilizes the infarcted myocardium, which may prevent
cardiac rupture but also reduce ventricle wall compliance and conductivity, and even interfere with regeneration
efforts. Understanding the mechanisms regulating post-injury CF activities will help the development of treatment
strategies that enhance the beneficial effect of CFs and inhibit their deleterious effects. We found that in response
to MI the expression of runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) in CFs increased significantly during both
myofibroblast and matrifibrocyte differentiation. Our preliminary study showed that Runx1 promoted CF
proliferation and inhibited their differentiation into myofibroblasts in vitro. In addition, we identified Ccn2 as a
potential target of Runx1. Ccn2 plays multiple roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation
through interacting with different cofactors. Thus, we hypothesize that Runx1 functions to balance the
proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation of CFs during the acute phase of MI and promote matrifibrocyte
differentiation in more stabilized infarct scars through direct targeting Ccn2, which is critical for maintaining tissue
integrity but also promotes adverse remodeling. In Aim #1, CF-specific tamoxifen-inducible Runx1 knockout (KO)
mice and wild type mice will be subjected to MI injury. Immunohistochemical staining, RNA-seq, and functional
assay will be employed to study the function of Runx1 in the proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, and
matrifibrocyte differentiation of CFs after MI. In Aim #2, the mechanism through which Runx1 regulates the
expression of Ccn2 will be studied using CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq, Hi-C, and co-IP coupled to mass spectrometry.
The unbiased approach will also identify other direct and indirect targets of Runx1. In Aim #3, CF-specific
tamoxifen-inducible Ccn2 KO mice will be employed to compare the effect of Ccn2 KO and Runx1 KO on CF
proliferation and differentiation after MI. The requirement of Ccn2 in the regulation of CF proliferation and
differentiation by Runx1 will also be studied. The synergistic effect between Ccn2 and its cofactors, HB-EGF and
TGFβ3, on cardiac fibroblast proliferation and differentiation will be studied as well.","427737",

Elevated platelet counts are detected in about 30% of ovarian cancer patients and associated with a poor
prognosis. We found that thrombocytosis in ovarian cancer is not just epiphenomena of an advanced
malignancy, but in fact, platelets promote tumor growth. By reducing platelet counts, we reduced the growth of
primary tumors in murine models of ovarian cancer. While most of the previous studies focused on the role of
platelets in promoting metastasis, we discovered that platelets increase the growth of primary tumors by
enhancing proliferation of cancer cells. The basis for the effect of platelets on tumor growth is the interactions
between platelets and cancer cells. We found that ovarian cancer cells activate platelets by secreting ADP, and
activated platelets secrete Tgfβ1 that promotes cancer cell proliferation. Blocking or deficiency of P2Y12 ADP
receptors on platelets, blocking or deficiency of Tgfβ1 in platelets, or reducing Tgfβ1 receptor 1 (TgfβR1) on
cancer cells reduced the pro-growth effects of platelets on ovarian cancer. During studies on ovarian cancer
tumors resected from patients and tumor-bearing mice, we observed extravascular platelets inside tumors. We
propose that the main effects of platelets on cancer are mediated by extravasated platelets. Migration of platelets
outside of blood vessels is not a well-known phenomenon, despite the fact that platelets possess the molecular
machinery required for extravasation, and are able to undergo drastic structural changes necessary for
extravasation of neutrophils that are professional migratory cells. Our in vivo and in-vitro studies on platelet
extravasation into tumors showed that this process is an active process and is reduced by antiplatelet agents
(aspirin or ticagrelor). In the first aim of this proposal, we will study the stimuli from tumors that initiate platelet
extravasation. We will identify the molecular mechanism of transendothelial migration of platelets, and
investigate the facilitatory effects of pericytes on platelets extravasation. After exiting blood vessels, platelets
become activated by cancer cells and tumor stroma. In the second aim of this proposal, we will investigate the
mechanism of platelet activation in the cancer by dissecting the role of various G-protein-coupled receptors on
platelets in tumor growth. We will study the redundancy, synergism, or opposing effects of different platelet G-
proteins on platelet-cancer cell interactions. In the third aim, we will investigate the correlation between our
findings in the murine models of ovarian cancer and the behavior of ovarian cancer in patients. We have used
advanced imaging studies to accurately and objectively quantify platelet density in tumor tissues. We will
determine platelet density in tumor specimens resected from 60 patients diagnosed with ovarian cancer in M.D.

our institution). We will correlate platelet density inside tumors with the response rate to surgery, chemotherapy,

Inner ear development requires the assembly of diverse cells from multiple embryonic lineages. The epithelial,
neuronal, and glial components of the inner ear are ectoderm-derived, whereas the mesenchymal components
are predominantly mesoderm-derived. A major engineering challenge is to establish multi-lineage inner ear
tissues in vitro, which researchers could use to study human hearing and balance-related diseases, investigate
developmental biology questions, and evaluate promising therapeutics. The routine use of patient-derived
inner ear explants for research is not feasible because the human inner ear is difficult to biopsy. Therefore, our
long-term goal is to define the chemical and physical signals required to recapitulate formation of functional
human inner ear tissue in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). This project builds upon a recent
technological innovation reported by our laboratory: a multi-stage 3D culture system for generating inner ear
organoids that contain sensory hair cells and neurons. Despite significant progress, there are remaining
questions about how faithfully inner ear organoids mimic normal embryonic development. Moreover, there are
technical hurdles that may limit integration of inner ear organoids into tissue-chip drug discovery platforms.
Specifically, organoid production efficiency is variable and the full range of cell types in organoids is unclear.
Moreover, our ability to track the development or physiology of inner ear sensory cells in real-time is limited.
Our research plan will define a next-generation inner ear organoid system. For Aim 1, we will use high-
throughput single-cell analysis to generate a cell fate map of developing inner ear organoids. In Aim 2, we will
generate dual-reporter hPSC lines for real-time monitoring of inner ear organoid sensorineural networks. In
Aim 3, we will engineer chemically-defined inner ear organoids with improved fidelity to mammalian
development. Finally, we will verify inner ear organoid production from a set of four human induced pluripotent
stem cell lines to ensure the reproducibility of our results. Together, completion of this project will deepen our
characterization of the human inner ear organoid model and facilitate transfer of the technology to other
research laboratories. Future investigations could pursue unexplored cell signaling mechanisms, model genetic
diseases, or integrate organoids into tissue-chip systems. We anticipate that our study will provide broadly
applicable insights that should aid the production of organoids of other sensory systems and should provide a
powerful tool for otolaryngology research.","460157",

PDAC is
highly invasive and forms metastases in distant organs at the very early stage of tumor progression. To better
understand PDAC metastasis, tumor-blood vessel interactions need to be evaluated further, as tumor cells
spread primarily through the blood circulation. However, how PDAC interacts with blood vessels and establishes
distant metastases are poorly understood. Recently, our study using both three-dimensional (3D) biomimetic
PDAC-on-chip and multiple in vivo mouse models showed that PDAC cells invaded blood vasculatures and
actively replaced endothelial cells via ALK7 signaling, leading to a formation of tumor-vessel hybrid structure in
PDAC tumors. We refer to this phenomenon as tumor vessel replacement. Despite the novelty of the finding, it
is unknown what the biological consequences of the tumor vessel replacement in PDAC are. Understanding the
phenotypic consequences of the tumor vessel replacement is critical to determine the clinical relevance and
significance of blocking ALK7 in PDAC. We hypothesize that PDAC tumor vessel replacement increases tumor
vessel permeability; then promotes tumor intravasation and metastasis by facilitating tumor cells’ entering the
blood circulation through the leakier vessels. In order to test these hypotheses, we aim to determine—in both in
vitro and in vivo—(i) if tumor vessel replacement induces tumor vessel leakiness and promotes metastatic
dissemination and (ii) if ALK7 inhibition or ALK7 knock out (KO) ameliorates or reverses tumor vessel leakiness
and metastasis. In Aim 1, we will assess the role of ALK7 in PDAC vessel permeability in pericyte-covered blood
vessel on-chip by co-culturing microvascular endothelial cells and pericytes to mimic physiological blood vessels
surrounded by pericytes (Aim 1.1). Next, we will evaluate the role of ALK7 in PDAC vessel dysfunction in vivo.
We will generate an orthotopic PDAC model using wild-type or ALK7-KO PDAC cells, and examine PDAC tumor
vessel permeability by intravenously injecting dextran molecules (Aim 1.2). In Aim 2, we will examine ALK7 in
PDAC metastasis in vitro by establishing pre-metastatic liver microenvironment in the reservoirs that are
connected to the engineered blood vessel. Multiple PDAC lines will be assessed to test whether ALK7-mediated
tumor vessel replacement affects metastatic spreading (Aim 2.1). We will then evaluate the role of ALK7 in PDAC
metastasis in vivo using human patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models in collaboration with Dr. Manuel Hidalgo.
Metastatic tumor burdens in control vs. ALK7 KO groups will be assessed, and the number of circulating tumor
cells and overall survival rate will be determined (Aim 2.2). In summary, our 3D PDAC-on-chip system will provide
a unique platform to better investigate PDAC interactions with blood vessels and metastatic progression. We will
decipher the roles of ALK7 signaling in mediating tumor vessel dysregulation and metastasis; and assess
whether we will be able to reduce PDAC progression and metastasis by targeting ALK7.","183164",

Based on “seed and soil” theory, certain tumors exhibit a predilection for metastasis to particular organs. For
example, bone is the most common site of metastasis for prostate cancer, happening in ~90% of patients with
advanced stages of prostate cancer. Organ-on-a-chip models of cancer metastasis have emerged as a powerful
predictor of cancer progression. However, despite the development in organ-on-a-chip platforms for in-vitro
studies in metastasis, research in bone metastasis on-a-chip remains largely underdeveloped, and the only few
available models in the literature lack the complex mineralization and the inclusion of bone cells, especially
osteoclasts into the system, which are essential elements in order to study bone remodeling. Here, (aim 1) we
will use a novel organ-on-a-chip platform with a highly mineralized and calcified cell-laden hydrogel including
osteoclasts to determine the influence of mineralization and the cross-talk of prostate cancer cells and bone cells
on the process of preferential prostate cancer growth in bone and the consequent bone resorption. A potentially
rate-limiting step in metastasis formation is the extravasation process that involves adhesion of tumor cells to
endothelial cells and their transmigration through the endothelial cell monolayer and basement membrane. It has
been well-established that pericyte-support of EC capillaries is required for formation of non-leaky vessels and
perturbation of the EC-hMSC linkage, therefore results in leaky vessels. The role of pericytes in tumor metastasis
has been mostly focused on tumor angiogenesis and the research on the role of this cell type on cancer
extravasation has remained underdeveloped. Here, (aim 2) we will use the bone metastasis-on-a-chip platform
to test the role of pericytes in a vasculature embedded in a mineralized bone matrix in inhibiting human prostate
cancer extravasation as well as the effects of factors released by cancer cells on vasculature integrity. We argue
that this multi-pronged strategy will enable the engineering of in-vitro bone metastasis-on-a-chip model system
to understand the preferential metastasis of prostate cancer to the bone and bone destruction as well as the role
of pericytes in prostate cancer extravasation through the vasculature. Ultimately, this project will lead to model
systems that can be used for studying cancer metastasis to bone and developing new treatments.","215985",

closely mimic areas of retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) and choriocapillaris loss. I have also
observed Müller cells anterior to drusen expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and appearing
to migrate to the ONL in eyes with AMD. These data indicate Müller cell activation and remodeling in
AMD. The stimuli for and consequences of these changes, however, are not understood. We
hypothesize that changes to the subretinal milieu in non-neovascular AMD stimulate Müller cell
activation and remodeling that exacerbates AMD pathology.
 The first Aim of this proposal will investigate how Müller cells are affected by subretinal changes that
occur in AMD. We will investigate Müller cell morphological and metabolic changes anterior to drusen in
human donor eyes with AMD. We will then evaluate the Müller cell response to drusen components,
amyloid beta and oxidized lipids, in vitro. The second subAim of Aim 1 will determine the effect that
RPE cells exert on Müller cells. While these cells are normally separated by the photoreceptor
segments, subretinal pathology as well as their abnormal migration and extension allows them to touch
in eyes with AMD. We will analyze the RPE influence on Müller cells using human AMD tissue and cell
culture experiments.
 The second proposed Aim focuses on how Müller cells in the subretinal space affect neighboring
cells. We will first investigate how Müller cells affect RPE cells using cell culture experiments. We will
also investigate extracellular vesicle release by Müller cells and, if present, determine what effect these
have on RPE cells. We will also investigate the composition of the subretinal glial membranes that we
have observed in GA. Since it is not possible to determine in human retinas how early in the disease
process glia intrude the subretinal space, we have developed a rat model with focal RPE cell atrophy.
We will also determine whether these glial membranes form a scar which will prevent the flow of
material, including future stem cell therapy, from the retina to subretinal space. Finally, we will inhibit
the membrane and determine how this affects disease progression in our rat model of RPE atrophy.
 These studies will determine the role glia play in AMD pathology, potentially identifying novel
treatments. By investigating extracellular vesicle and exosome release from Müllers, our studies will
identify how Müller cells interact with other cell types in the normal and diseased retina.","368437",

Metastasis, the spread of cancer from primary tumor site to distal organs, is the cause of over 80% of deaths
from cancer. The brain is one of the common metastasis locations. Brain metastasis, which develops in the late
course of illness, has become a significant problem in clinic due to its rising incidence as a consequence of
prolonged survival and limited efficacy of existing systemic therapies. Metastasis is a multi-step process that
requires the complex interplay between cancer cells and the stromal cells, a process commonly referred to as
“seed and soil hypothesis” coined over a century ago. The ‘soil’, the microenvironment, not only decides the
outgrowth of metastatic cancer cells, but also contributes to therapy resistance. The ‘seed’, the invaded cancer
cells, directly modifies the surrounding brain stromal cells. Our long-term goal is to dissect the complex
interactions between cancer cells and brain stromal cells during metastasis.
We have developed novel in vivo and in vitro models to address the gaps in our understanding of brain
microenvironmental control of metastatic outgrowth. Our data implicate that astrocytes, the unique and most
abundant brain cells, activate PPAR signaling in brain metastatic melanoma cells. Through an integrative
approach using in vitro co-culture assays and in vivo brain metastatic mouse models, Aim 1 will delineate the
role of PPAR pathway in melanoma cells during brain metastasis. We will track the dynamic changes and effect
of PPAR signaling in melanoma cells throughout the whole brain metastatic process. Moreover, PPAR
antagonist will be used in our pre-clinical mouse models to test its potential to treat melanoma brain metastasis.
Aim 2 will address how astrocytes activate PPAR signaling in the invades melanoma cells. We hypothesize
that astrocytes serve as ‘donor’ of unsaturated fatty acids, natural agonist of PPAR, to the invaded melanoma
cells. The gained insights may enable us to mechanistically deconstruct melanoma brain metastasis and develop
new treatment strategies for patients with little clinical recourse.","367319",

Diabetes Mellitus is an ever-growing disease that results from functional pancreatic b-cell loss, causing severe
and life-threatening complications in suffering patients. Importantly, b-cells do not function alone but in structures
called islets that are crucial for regulation of blood glucose. Understanding the transcriptional regulation that
dictates initial appearance, development, and formation of these islet structures will lead to enhancement of our
ability to design cell-based treatments to improve diabetic quality of life and survival.","NIDDK","10307990","11/18/2021 12:00:00 AM","PA-19-195","5F31DK120217-03","5","F31","DK","120217","03"," ","CASTLE, ARTHUR","12/1/2019 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2022 12:00:00 AM","ZDK1-GRB-2(O1)"," ","15429914","TOREN, ELIANA ","Not Applicable","07","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","063690705","YND4PLMC9AN7","063690705","YND4PLMC9AN7","US","33.506935","-86.809252","1288803","UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM","BIRMINGHAM","AL","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","352940001","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2022 12:00:00 AM","847","Training, Individual","2022"," "," ","NIDDK","44756"," "," ","PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic islets are comprised of five hormone-secreting cell types and are vital regulators of glucose
homeostasis in mammals. Specifically, glucagon producing α-cells and insulin producing b-cells act
synchronously to tightly regulate blood glucose and allow for normal metabolic function in tissues. During
diabetes, loss of functional b-cell mass leads to severe complications in suffering patients. With diagnoses of
diabetes rising at an alarming rate worldwide, key to future diabetes treatments is a greater
understanding of the transcriptional complexes mediating not only early b-cell, but whole islet
differentiation and formation. The first step of specification of all islet cells is the delamination of endocrine
progenitors (marked by Neurogenin3, Ngn3) out of the ductal epithelium through a process known as epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT), mediated by the Snail2 transcription factor. This step occurs as early as
embryonic day (E)10.5 in mice and is absolutely required for formation of mature islets. Our lab previously
showed that a transcriptional co-regulator, LIM domain binding protein 1 (Ldb1) is required for pancreatic
development at various stages. In a pancreas-wide Ldb1 knockout, we observed disrupted progenitor pools at
E13.5, and a severe loss of Ngn3+ endocrine progenitors at E15.5. Upon birth, these mice lack islet structures,
highlighting the importance of Ldb1 in the development of endocrine cells and formation of islet structures.
Additionally, these neonatal mutant mice exhibited an abnormal clustering of immature endocrine cells along the
ducts. This observation, plus the loss of Ngn3+ cells, suggests that there is a delamination defect during
development. For this training plan, I propose to investigate the role of Ldb1 in pancreatic endocrine
progenitor delamination and the mechanisms by which Ldb1 complexes impart their effects. My
overarching hypothesis is that Ldb1 is required for development of the endocrine progenitor population. In Aim
1, I will determine the contribution of Ldb1 to endocrine progenitor delamination, by assessing canonical EMT
markers throughout development, as well as lineage tracing to determine the fate of endocrine progenitors in the
absence of Ldb1. In Aim 2, I will characterize Ldb1-mediated regulatory mechanisms, with a focus on Ldb1
regulation of Ngn3 and Snail2. I will use Chromatin ImmunoPreciptation (ChIP)-Seq to determine targets directly
bound by Ldb1, and RNA-Seq to gain insight into the genome-wide effects of Ldb1 loss in endocrine progenitors.
A greater understanding of transcriptional control of EMT in the developing pancreas gained from this research
will provide a deeper understanding of how islets arise, benefiting future diabetes therapies, including directed
stem cell differentiation strategies.","44756",

HNSCC is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Most deaths are caused by metastasis after
treatment failure, but unfortunately, a firm understanding of the molecular pathways that drive treatment
resistance remains elusive. For example, it is unclear why the vast majority of tumor cells are successfully
eliminated by treatment, yet a few escape destruction. Are these cells in a privileged cell state that enables
evasion of these drugs? Or does resistance emerge adaptively upon treatment? Given the morbidity and
mortality associated with HNSCC, there is an urgent need to answer these questions, but this has been
prevented by two major obstacles. First, HNSCC tumors are highly heterogeneous, so bulk genomic methods
cannot discern subpopulations of cells that might give rise to resistant clones. Second, nearly all existing genomic
methods are destructive and require specimen lysis at the time of measurement. This “destruction upon
observation” has made it impossible to correlate molecular events that occurred in the past with the final fates of
the cells in which these events took place. To overcome these barriers, we have recently utilized single-cell RNA-
seq (scRNA-seq) to characterize heterogeneity among HNSCC tumors, defining a partial epithelial-to-
mesenchymal (p-EMT) program which predicts HNSCC outcomes (Puram et al., Cell). We have also developed
a novel single-cell ‘Calling Card’ (scCC) technology that can record the genome-wide interactions of any
transcription factor (TF), creating a permanent molecular memory of all binding events that occur at a given
moment or epoch (Moudgil et al., Cell). This allows transient molecular interactions to be captured non-
destructively and read out later (e.g. after drug treatment), allowing us to “go back in time” and determine which
cell states enabled a cell to resist treatment. We accomplish this by fusing any TF to the piggyBac transposase,
which bestows the TF with the ability to direct transposon insertion into the genome near where it binds. We will
use this technology to define the mechanisms by which HNSCC cells persist after cetuximab treatment and then
evolve to produce resistant clones, identifying genes and pathways that can be targeted by adjuvant therapies.
Specifically, we hypothesize there are subpopulations of tumor cells in a pre-existing p-EMT state that
confers immunity to drug treatment. To test this hypothesis, we will first use our molecular memory tool to
determine why some cells acquire p-EMT but others do not (Aim 1). This Aim is critical because EMT plays a
key role in the development of cetuximab resistance, and our extensive experience with p-EMT will allow us to
use this system to mature and benchmark our molecular memory tool. To probe pathways specific to cetuximab
resistance, we will utilize scCC to evaluate HNSCC lines with cetuximab resistance and sensitivity and record
both pre-existing and adaptive changes in cell state. We will validate these findings in vivo, establishing a set of
genes and molecular pathways responsible for therapeutic resistance and thereby revealing new targets to
overcome these mechanisms as well as biomarker predictors of treatment response.","275625",

fundamental basis for IL-17 signaling, with the premise that defining the molecular
mediators of disease pathology will ultimately help lead to development of the most
effective or specific therapeutic targets, diagnostics or biomarkers. IL-17 regulates
downstream inflammatory genes by transcriptional mechanisms, mainly involving the
canonical NF-κB pathway as well as CCAAT/Enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs). IL-17
also activates numerous post-transcriptional mechanisms that control mRNA stability
and translation. In a screen to identify new intermediates involved in IL-17-dependent
downstream signaling, we discovered that IL-17 induces a novel RNA binding protein
(RBP) that was never previously linked to IL-17 signaling, T cells or autoimmune
pathology. Strikingly, cells lacking this RBP exhibited markedly impaired in IL-17
signaling, especially activation of NF-κB and C/EBPδ. In vivo, mice lacking this RBP
were refractory to IL-17-driven inflammatory diseases, including experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, and AGN, a model of

We have developed a 3D bioengineered human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived model of IPF that
displays progressive fibrosis and closely phenocopies several characteristics associated with IPF. This model is
an extension of our 2D model of progressive fibrosis (Vijayaraj et al., Cell Reports – in press). To make our
progressive fibrosis model specific to IPF, we have developed it into a model system that utilizes the lung 3D
architecture and specific cell types. Our 3D model displays additional features of IPF such as airway epithelial
cell (AEC) apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and replacement of alveolar architecture.
Our proposal aims to improve and validate this 3D model such that it will be amenable to a high throughput drug
discovery platform in a patient specific manner for precision medicine. Our project aims to use our unique
stem/progenitor cell models of IPF to increase our understanding of the disease and for drug discovery.

A. To validate the 3D model of IPF by performing extensive characterization of the model compared to human
 IPF lung tissue.
B. To characterize the heterogeneity of IPF seen across different patients.

Specific Aim 2 – To use our 3D bioengineered iPSC-derived model to study cellular plasticity in IPF
To profile cellular plasticity of AECs in our 3D model of IPF and compare it to human IPF tissue using single cell

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy with poor outcomes for those with
serous histology. Chemotherapy resistance is common in recurrent disease and very few targeted therapies
are available. However, there is growing evidence that some serous or molecularly serous-like ECs have
evidence for homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRD). Here we show that EC patient derived
xenograft (PDX) models also revealed a higher frequency of HRD in serous EC, as determined by a genomic
score of HRD (based on telomeric allelic imbalance, large state transitions, and loss of heterozygosity). Serous
EC were also more sensitive to rucaparib, a poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (PARPi), in an ex
vivo 3D culture system. To confirm the dependence of an HRD-high EC on HR DNA repair, SN38 was used to
provoke single- and double-strand DNA breaks concurrently with rucaparib and indeed, the observed synergy
was consistent with a deficiency of HR repair. Further validation of HRD was demonstrated in an in vivo PDX
study showing the combination of rucaparib plus a novel formulation of SN38 (PLX038A) resulted in a marked
and unparalleled regression of tumors. Remarkably, four of eight mice had undetectable tumors. However,
several questions require investigation to facilitate the clinical use of PARPis and/or the combination with
PLX038A. It is unknown whether the HRD score of other ECs (e.g serous-like, regardless of histology) will
predict response to a PARPi and if the genetic HRD score can be improved by including another omics data to
more accurately predict response to a PARPi. To test the hypothesis that an HRD score in ECs can predict
response to a PARPi and the synergy with SN38 is dependent on HR deficiency, the following aims are
planned. We propose to i) predict PARPi sensitivity using the genomic HRD score and a novel mRNA
signature of PARPi response, ii) determine the efficacy of rucaparib alone and in combination with SN38 in a
larger cohort of EC PDXs ex vivo and in vivo, and iii) evaluate a dual-omics score in relation to PARPi
response in fresh surgical specimens of primary patient tumors ex vivo. The data generated from this
application will be used to justify clinical use of PARPis in a molecularly defined subset of ECs. In addition,
since rucaparib + PLX038 is currently in phase 1 trials (NCT04209595) with plans to open a phase 2 trial in
ovarian cancer, these data will support an expansion cohort in EC.","222998",

Patients with glioblastoma (GBM) have a 12-14 month median survival rate, ~10% chance of 5-year survival,
and ~90% likelihood of recurrence, even after receiving standard of care (SOC), which involves tumor resection,
fractionated radiation therapy (XRT), and chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ). There is growing evidence
that this poor prognosis and dismal therapy responsiveness emerges from interplay of tumor cell heterogeneity
and non-genetic, treatment-induced shifts of cellular phenotypic states. Notably, the SOC has been shown to
drive a shift of tumor cells from a drug-susceptible proneural (PN) subtype to a drug-resistant mesenchymal
(MES) subtype. This partly explains why primary GBM tumors of the classical or PN subtype often recur as the
more aggressive and drug-resistant MES subtype. To complicate matters further, extrinsic signals and stressors
can drive dedifferentiation of a heterogeneous tumor cell population into immature, glioma stem-like cells
(GSCs), which have been implicated in tumor recurrence. GSCs are resistant to multiple cytotoxic drugs like
TMZ, which motivates the need for discovering novel cytotoxic drugs, including drugs repurposed from other
indications, to treat GBM. Notably, we have discovered that off-label FDA-approved drugs are effective against
patient-derived GSCs (PD-GSCs) increasing median survival of patients by >3X, but can also induce transition
of a surviving subpopulation from a susceptible PN subtype to a MES subtype – called PN-to-MES transition
(PMT). Here, we propose to elucidate at single-cell resolution the mechanisms by which diverse drugs induce
PMT within a heterogeneous population of GSCs. We hypothesize that early response to drug treatments will
vary by mechanisms of action of drugs and patient-specific characteristics of PD-GSCs, but cytotoxic events will
drive these responses onto a common pathway that can be targeted with genetic and chemical interventions to
block drug-induced PMT. We will test this hypothesis by single-cell profiling of longitudinal changes in
transcription (scRNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq), and phenotypes of up to 34 patient-derived
GSCs (PD-GSCs) across 76 FDA approved anti-proliferative compounds. We will integrate the longitudinal multi-
omic profiles to discover the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) that mechanistically drives drug-induced
PMT in each PD-GSC. By comparing TRNs across PD-GSCs and drug treatments, we will identify, perturb, and
characterize mechanisms of drug-induced PMT in each PD-GSC. Using FDA-approved drugs mapped to
validated mechanisms, we will perform high throughput screens to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of our
model-driven approach to identify drug combinations that synergistically kill PD-GSCs, without inducing PMT.
Outcomes of this project include (i) methodology to elucidate single-cell resolution TRNs within subpopulations
of a heterogeneous tumor, (ii) insight into mechanisms of drug-induced PMT in PD-GSCs, and (iii) a rational
strategy to repurpose, and tailor FDA-approved combination drug regimens for off-label use in treating GBM.

 Obesity is a growing epidemic, with more than two-thirds of adults in the United States overweight or
obese. Although diet-induced weight loss reduces obesity-related complications, it is increasingly recognized
that serious complications of weight loss occur, including fractures and sarcopenia. This is an important public
health issue given the large number of adults seeking weight loss, and the increasing prevalence rates of
osteoporosis and sarcopenia. However, little is known about the effects of different pharmacologic therapies for
weight loss on bone and muscle. The proposed research will investigate whether the glucagon-like peptide 1
receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), liraglutide, which is FDA-approved for the treatment of obesity, mitigates bone
resorption and muscle mass loss associated with weight loss. If this is true, then liraglutide may be a preferred
pharmacologic therapy for weight loss, especially in adults with obesity and osteoporosis or sarcopenia.
 Preclinical data suggest that GLP-1 RAs may be anabolic to bone and muscle. GLP-1 promotes bone
formation while suppressing bone resorption in vitro. In rodent models, GLP-1 RAs increase bone density and
strength and increase muscle mass. However, clinical data regarding the effects of GLP-1 RAs, as prescribed
for weight loss, on bone metabolism markers, as well as muscle mass and strength, are lacking.
 Osteoblasts and adipocytes are differentiated from common mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells.
Weight loss increases marrow adipose tissue (MAT), which can be measured by MR spectroscopy in humans,
and is associated with decreased bone mineral density. In vitro data suggest that GLP-1 RAs inhibit marrow
adipogenesis while promoting osteoblast differentiation, but whether decreasing MAT is a mechanism by which
GLP-1 RAs affect bone mass in humans is not known.
 Our hypothesis is that 3 months of daily subcutaneous liraglutide will result in lower bone
resorption markers, higher bone formation markers, less muscle mass loss, and a reduction in MAT
compared to a lifestyle intervention resulting in a comparable amount of weight loss, Healthy Habits for
Life (HHL), in 40 otherwise healthy adults with obesity. The current proposal is a pilot study with two aims:
Aim 1 investigates the effects of liraglutide on bone metabolism markers and MAT compared to an intensive
lifestyle intervention for weight loss, while Aim 2 investigates the effects of liraglutide on muscle mass and
strength compared to an intensive lifestyle intervention for weight loss.
 The proposed protocol builds on Dr. Melanie Schorr Haines’s K23 project and growing area of expertise
in the endocrine determinants of body composition, with a focus on muscle, and their contribution to
cardiometabolic disease and skeletal integrity. This pilot study will provide critical preliminary data for an R01
proposal to conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to determine whether GLP-1 RAs result in
preservation of bone density and muscle mass despite weight loss in individuals with obesity.","112264",

adults. The cause of IPF is not fully understood, and it is frequently progressive, often leading 
to death within several years of diagnosis. In IPF, there is loss of alveolar epithelial cells, 
including type 1 cells (AEC1s), which line the alveolar airspace surface, and type 2 (AEC2s), which 
secrete surfactant, self-renew, and give rise to AEC1s and development of honeycomb cysts. These 
cysts are lined by ""bronchiolized"" epithelium, so-called because of expression of airway and 
secretory cell markers such as p63, KRT5, KRT17, and MUC5B. The origin of the cells lining these 
cysts is not understood, but have generally been thought to be the result of migration of airway 
epithelial cells (basal and/or club), in a failed attempt at alveolar repair. Recent single-cell 
RNA (sc-RNA) sequencing studies have uncovered widespread AEC2 and other epithelial cell 
abnormalities in end-stage IPF tissue, such as intermediate/transitional cell states and ectopic 
expression of genes associated with airway cells (such as KRT5+ AEC2s). Our lab has recently shown 
that AEC2s are capable of reprogramming into KRT5+ basal-cell like cells in in vitro organoid 
cultures. These suggest a new hypothesis that the bronchiolized epithelium lining honeycomb cysts 
may actually be derived from reprogrammed AEC2s. This study seeks to characterize whether the 
epithelial abnormalities present in end-stage IPF tissue are also present earlier in the IPF 
disease course and to determine the role of TGFβ1 in regulating the aforementioned reprogramming. 
Samples from patients undergoing surgical biopsy for the purpose of clinical diagnosis will be 
analyzed by sc-RNA sequencing, to characterize the AEC2 and other epithelial cell populations and 
reconstruct estimated lineages, especially surrounding the induction of the basal-cell 
differentiation master- regulator Sox2 within AEC2s. These samples will be compared to normal and 
end-stage IPF tissue, in order to test the hypothesis that AEC2 reprogramming is an early feature 
of IPF. In addition, diagnostic biopsy samples will be obtained from patients who took 
epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) for two weeks prior to biopsy. EGCG is a mesenchyme-specific 
inhibitor of TGFβ signaling under study in humans and will therefore allow us to examine the 
hypothesis that AEC2 reprogramming abnormalities seen in diagnostic biopsies can be reversed by 
TGFβ blockade. Finally, organoid co-cultures and precision-cut lung slices cultures will be used to 
examine the contribution of important signaling pathways, such as TGFβ, Wnt, and Notch, in driving 
AEC2 reprograming towards a SPC-/KRT5+ basal-cell like state. Knowledge of the mechanisms driving 
AEC2 reprograming in IPF may provide fundamental insight into the cause of this disorder and 
contribute to the development of targeted therapies for this incurable and frequently fatal 
disease. This proposed project will be performed as part of the research phase of Pulmonary & 
Critical Care Medicine Fellowship at UCSF and utilizes comprehensive institutional support and 
resources, in order to prepare the applicant for an independent research career.","74886",

variety of processes including remodeling of chromatin structure, cell migration and invasion, and
apoptosis. The elevated level of NatD in human lung and colorectal cancer tissues correlates with
poor clinical outcomes. Moreover, loss of NatD suppresses human lung cancer cell invasion and
decreases the tumor growth in colorectal cancer xenograft mice models. Hence, we hypothesize
that NatD is a compelling target for the development of novel cancer therapeutics for lung and

we will employ a series of facile and reproducible high-throughput screening (HTS) assays with
orthogonal readouts to screen 400,000 diverse compounds from selected chemical libraries at
the Chemical Genomics Facility at Purdue Institute for Drug Discovery. Then we will characterize
active compounds in structural, mechanistic, selectivity, and cell-based studies. Upon completion

Understanding the role of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN in human disease is challenging because its protein
product controls many aspects of cellular physiology, including cell division, DNA repair, and cytoskeletal
organization. This challenge is exemplified by the myriad of phenotypes observed in patients with germline PTEN
variants and the difficulty in classifying clinically-sequenced PTEN missense variants as pathogenic versus
benign. In light of these difficulties, this project aims to systematically catalogue the effect of thousands of PTEN
missense variants on multiple cellular phenotypes, with the goals of better understanding the role of PTEN in
disease and helping classify clinically-observed PTEN missense variants. To do this, three high-throughput
functional assays – testing for cell growth, resistance to genotoxic agents, and cellular morphology – will be
employed in cultured human cell lines. By examining the relationships between these cancer-related cellular
phenotypes, PTEN missense variation, and clinical outcomes, it will be possible, for the first time, to
comprehensively dissect the role of PTEN in germline inherited disease and somatic cancers.
First, a high-throughput, growth-based functional assay will be used to measure the effect of a library of nearly
all possible PTEN missense variants for their ability to inhibit cellular growth, the primary PTEN function thought
to be important for human disease. The growth assay will be repeated in the presence of genotoxic agents to
measure the effect of PTEN variants in protecting against DNA damage. Second, a microscope-based selection
for cell morphology will be performed using a new technology we developed that analyzes millions of cells and
separates them based on microscopic visual phenotypes. Each of these high-throughput assays will annotate
each missense variant with a quantitative score documenting the effect of that variant on the selected phenotype.
Third, once the data are collected, the relative contribution of each PTEN function to disease will be examined
by comparing which functions are lost in variants annotated as pathogenic in ClinVar and in variants commonly
found in tumors.
These high-throughput experiments will be completed under the supervision of Dr. Douglas Fowler, who
pioneered large-scale, sequencing-based functional assays. The lab has already published a paper quantifying
the effect of PTEN missense variants on a much simpler phenotype, protein abundance, and so already has the
tools and knowledge required for studying this critical tumor suppressor. Courses that focus on the responsible
conduct of research and the biometric statistical analyses will be pursued to ensure the reproducibility and proper
analysis of the data. Additional help with interpreting the findings’ clinical utility will be provided by Dr. Mary-
Claire King, who works with patients harboring PTEN variants, and by Dr. Colin Pritchard, who is the head of
Lab Medicine at the University of Washington and oversees the clinical sequencing core.","51036",

the most common cause of acquired heart disease of childhood in the developed world. Despite current best
treatments, approximately one quarter of patients will have persistent morbidity. This proposal presents a five
year research career development program with a focus on the study of inflammation in KD, with the goals of
expanding understanding of KD and cardiac inflammation, and developing of skills and experience of the
applicant. The study builds on the candidate's initial human finding and subsequent murine data relating to the
role of an important cardiac-related protein known as Follistatin-Like Protein 1 (FSTL-1) in KD. FSTL-1 has
been shown to have defined and critical roles in protecting cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts after myocardial
infarct, but its role in inflammation has not been well characterized. Preliminary data shows that FSTL-1 is
associated with inflammation in Kawasaki disease in humans, and that in a mouse model, knockout of the
protein aggravates disease while treatment with exogenous protein attenuates inflammation. Glycosylated
FSTL-1 can downregulate macrophage inflammatory responses, and macrophages are critical for the
development of KD. The candidate will study the role of FSTL-1 in cardiac inflammation, hypothesizing that
the glycosylated form of FSTL-1 is a counter-regulator of cardiac inflammation, promoting a Th2 T-cell
phenotype and down-regulating the macrophage inflammatory response.
 The aims of the proposal are 1): Determine whether exogenous glycosylated FSTL-1 promotes a Th2 T-
cell phenotype and downregulates the inflammatory macrophage response in the mouse model of KD. 2)
Establish whether glycosylated and non-glycosylated FSTL-1 differentially affect the human macrophage
inflammatory response in vitro. 3) Define whether inflammatory stimulus in KD induces differential FSTL-1
isoforms in cardiac tissue lines, using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).
 The accomplishment of these aims would clarify the role of FSTL-1 (a critical mediator of cardiac function)
in the setting of cardiac inflammation and allow investigation into novel methods of modulating cardiac and
systemic inflammation. The candidate is an assistant professor at the Columbia University School of Medicine
and is firmly committed to a career in basic and translational research in inflammation and immunology. The
candidate has 75% protected time for research, laboratory and office space, and funding for supplies,
equipment and personnel. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to
advance the candidate's skills and in molecular biology required for developing expertise in immunology and
cardiac inflammation. Under the guidance of his mentor and advisory team, he will advance his basic and

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) results from hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transformation by the BCR-
ABL tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are effective in inducing remission and prolonging survival
in CML patients, but fail to eliminate primitive leukemia stem cells (LSC) that can regenerate disease. Most
patients need ongoing TKI treatment to maintain remission, and remain at risk of toxicity, financial hardship and
non-adherence. The long-term goal of our research is to improve understanding of mechanisms of LSC
resistance to treatment, to support development of effective and safe strategies for LSC targeting, and enhance
possibilities of treatment-free remissions in CML patients. Mitochondrial metabolism plays a critical regulatory
role in normal HSC function. CML LSC demonstrate increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) compared to low OXPHOS in normal HSC. However, mitochondria also play important roles in
metabolic processes besides OXPHOS, including fatty acid, glutamine and glucose oxidation, and generation of
biosynthetic intermediates. The rationale for our studies is that specific mitochondrial metabolic alterations that
contribute to altered LSC growth and TKI resistance are not known. Our preliminary studies show initial inhibition
of OXPHOS in CML LSC after TKI treatment, but subsequent restoration of OXPHOS, and increased fatty acid
oxidation (FAO), with continued treatment. A SIRT1, P53 and MYC regulatory network plays an important role
in LSC propagation. We show that SIRT1 and its target PGC-1α play an important role in increased OXPHOS in
CML LSC. PPARa, a PGC-1α-coactivated transcription factor and a key regulator of FAO, shows increased
expression in CML LSC after TKI treatment, and contributes to increased OXPHOS, proliferation and survival.
We will explore the hypothesis that increased FAO following BCR-ABL kinase inhibition, together with
maintenance of high levels of OXPHOS, glycolysis and glutaminolysis, contributes to TKI resistance in CML
LSC, and that metabolic regulatory mechanisms represent potential targets for elimination of TKI-treated CML
LSC. In Specific Aim 1 we will use a combination of gene expression, extracellular flux, metabolite profiling and
in vitro and in vivo metabolic labeling to study effects of TKI treatment on mitochondrial metabolism in CML LSC,
examine the role of SIRT1, PGC1a and PPARa in metabolic alterations, and study interactions of MYC and p53
regulatory networks with mitochondrial metabolism. In Specific Aim 2 we will investigate the role of increased
OXPHOS and FAO in promoting TKI resistance in CML LSC. Bone marrow microenvironment niches play a
critical role in maintaining quiescent, TKI-resistant LSC populations. However, the role of the microenvironment
in metabolic regulation of LSC growth is not known, and will be evaluated here . These studies are significant
since they are expected to identify mechanisms of metabolic regulation underlying TKI resistance in CML LSC,
establish connections between metabolism and other regulatory mechanisms in CML LSC, and identify new
targets for therapy. The concepts developed here will have broad implications for other malignancies.","382717",

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults and is virtually
incurable. Despite aggressive treatments that include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, the average
survival is 15.4 months, with less than 5% of patients surviving > 5 years. Immunotherapy is a promising new
approach to treat GBM as it harnesses one’s own immune system to recognize and kill aberrant cancer cells.
Unfortunately, ongoing trials with immunotherapies show disappointing results in most GBM patients, indicating
that we need to better understand the intricate and dynamic interactions between glioma and immune cells that
generate and maintain highly immune suppressive microenvironment in GBM.
The major goal of this application is to test our hypothesis that S100A4 is a critical regulator of the GBM
immune landscape. S100A4 is a small calcium binding protein that functions intracellularly as well as
extracellularly. We recently reported that S100A4 is necessary for human and mouse glioma stem cell self-
renewal. Our single cell RNA-sequencing analyses of human GBM shows that S100A4 is expressed in both
glioma cells and immune suppressive leukocytes. Consistently, TCGA data analyses indicate that S100A4
expression is strongly correlated with primary and recurrent GBM patient survival, the mesenchymal subtype,
and immune-suppressive macrophage markers (such as CD163, CD206, and IL10). Importantly, our
unpublished results show that S100A4 in human and mouse glioma cells regulates expression of chemokines
and cytokines that control immune cell infiltration and polarization towards immune suppressive phenotypes.
Notably, knocking down S100a4 in glioma cells is sufficient to reprogram the immune environment and allow
dramatic increase in T-cell infiltration and activation in mouse gliomas. Furthermore, deletion of S100a4 in the
host mouse is also sufficient to reprogram the glioma immune landscape and extend survival (manuscripts in
preparation). Therefore, we hypothesize that S100A4 functions in both glioma and immune to promote
immune-suppressive environment in GBM through multiple mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we will:
1) elucidate mechanisms through which S100A4 expression in glioma cells promotes local immune-suppressive
microenvironment in GBM (Aim 1); and 2) determine mechanisms through which S100a4 expression in immune
cells controls myeloid and T cell trafficking, polarization, and function (Aim2). Successful completion of this study
will reveal how S100A4 regulates glioma associated immune cell infiltration/polarization and identify a potential
novel immunotherapy target to treat GBM.","394788",

is resistant to current therapies as the local micro-environment provides signals that protect the tumor cells.
Herein we will discern those signals, to development biomarkers for detecting cryptic disease, and disrupt the

severely; BrCa is also more prevalent and morbid in military women. Localized primary carcinomas are often
found and removed, curing up to 80% of the women and few men afflicted. Once the cancer has disseminated,
current therapies, even newer biologics and immunotherapies, prolong life for just a few years. Signals and cell
behaviors that enable metastatic survival and outgrowth of disseminated tumors are critical transition points.
 Our investigations during the present and previous Award periods demonstrated that upon dissemination to
the ectopic microenvironment, the parenchymal cells direct the tumor cells to re-express epithelial markers
including the defining E-cadherin. This cell-cell cohesion marker forms heterotypic binding that renders the
tumor cells more resistant to killing by chemotherapies and death cytokines and down-regulate targets of
immunotherapy. This protection from death signals proceeds through E-cadherin-triggered signaling involving
at least the PI3 kinase-AKT pathway with the specific pathways being targeted herein.
 We also investigate that this epithelial reversion also likely leads to tumor cell dormancy, a complication of
tumor dissemination. We have modeled this to demonstrate that quiescence of the entire organ underlies the
dormancy, but that this non-proliferative state is plastic with stimulated cells being `awakened' and regaining an
aggressive mesenchymal phenotype secondary to activation of the supporting nonparenchymal cells by
specific stressors leads to inflammation-triggered outgrowth that will be investigated herein.
Hypothesis: Our foundational model posits that E-cadherin-ligandation signals promote tumor cell dormancy
and survival via select signaling pathways that can be targeted to reverse the chemo-resistance and possibly
immune-escape. By discerning the operative signals and pathways we can develop novel approaches to
micrometastases in targeting the emergent breast cancer cells. The interplay of tumor cells with cells of the
metastatic microenvironment dictates both responsiveness to tumor-targeted therapies and dormancy/
outgrowth. This hypothesis leads to two linked questions – what are the mechanisms that confer the resistance
of metastasis, and why do the tumor cells then later emerge from this dormant stage to grow as lethal tumors.
These topics will lead to novel approaches by which these emergent carcinoma cells will be targeted.
Specific Aims: Two linked but independent aims will be pursued simultaneously:
I. Define the key tumor cell mechanisms that provide for resistance to killing in the micrometastatic
niche and determine if targeting them can enhance chemosensitivity. E-cadherin promotes survival, at
least in part, by signaling via the canonical AKT pathway, with our preliminary data supporting that targeting
these intermediary kinases can abrogate the chemoresistance of metastasis. However, different AKT isoforms
confound the efficacy. Enhanced chemo-sensitization will be established in a combination of preclinical models
in culture, and innovative ex vivo microphysiological systems/bioreactor, and then validated in animal models.
II. Determine the cues that activate the micrometastatic niche to trigger emergence from dormancy.
Emergence from dormancy heralds the lethal stage of disseminated breast cancer. We found that the micro-
metastatic niche both reflects and supports the quiescent during dormancy and activation driving outgrowth.
We will determine critical signals in inflammatory response/tumor growth event for biomarker development and
intervention using patient-derived tumor cells and serum specimens, validating in preclinical models.
 The successful completion of these experiments will shed new light on how to manipulate molecular controls
of cell behavior that are subverted in breast carcinoma to promote progression. Validation of even components
of our foundational model and our initial translational effort would highlight future avenues for rational
interventions for the therapeutically refractory stage of cancer, clinically undetectable micrometastases.

layer of elastic and muscular arteries, specifically on elastic fibers, leading to arterial stiffening and tearing. An
independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in diabetic and chronic kidney-disease patients, it
predisposes patients to cardiovascular mortality and lower extremity amputation. There are no treatments to
reverse calcification. Elastin protein has a half-life of >60 years with almost no turnover. During aging and disease
processes, elastic fibers degrade and are prone to calcification. We have developed unique nanoparticles that
can be targeted to degraded elastic lamina in vasculature while sparing healthy arteries. This project is focused
on removing mineral deposits by targeting chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) to the
degraded and calcified elastin in arteries. Then, nanoparticles loaded with pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) will be
targeted to seal calcium-binding sites, inhibit enzymatic degradation, and restore lost elastin to improve vascular
elasticity. Our strong published data show that such targeted EDTA chelation therapy, based on albumin
nanoparticles, reverses experimentally created vascular calcification and avoids possible side effects of systemic
chelation therapy. We would like to take this approach forward in a clinically relevant animal model of chronic
kidney failure caused by adenine and high phosphorus diet.
In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that reversal of elastin-specific vascular calcification is possible
when targeted nanoparticles deliver a chelating agent, EDTA, to the site of vascular calcification in a rat model
of adenine-induced uremia that causes vascular calcification. We will also determine whether calcification returns
after termination of EDTA therapy by monitoring animals for extended periods and whether such therapy has
any adverse effect on bone density and organ health. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that dual
therapy of targeted NPs carrying EDTA (to remove mineralization) followed NPs carrying PGG (to block calcium
binding sites) will prevent return of vascular calcification and improve vascular function irrespective of CKD
disease in a rat model of adenine-induced uremia. Such PGG therapy will also prevent further enzymatic
degradation of elastin and reverse chondro/osteogenic phenotypic change of vascular smooth muscle cells. In
Specific Aim 3, using genetically altered mice, we will test the hypothesis that permanent reversal of calcification
will lead to vascular homeostasis through reversing transdifferentiation of VSMC-osteoblast-like cell transition or
by repopulation of media with new VSMCs from either pericytes, endothelial to mesenchymal transition
(EndoMT), or hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) migration.
With successful completion of these studies, we will, for the first time, have developed a targeted therapy
approach to remove vascular calcification. This research, if successful, will lead to new therapies to improve
vascular health in CKD and diabetic patients with vascular calcification.","492812",

receptor, expressed in primary cilia, in both preadipocytes to trigger adipogenesis and in pancreatic b cells to enhance insulin secretion. The proposal extends from a recent discovery in the Jackson lab of a dramatic requirement for primary cilia in de novo adipogenesis and for the accumulation of fat mass in mice (Cell 2019). Using a knockout of TULP3, a critical regulator of ciliary GPCR trafficking, the group has established a requirement for ciliary GPCR signaling and screened 36 candidates to discover that the w-3 fatty acid (FA) receptor FFAR4/GPR120 is critical. Using FFAR4 and ciliary markers, the group finds that ciliated FFAR4+ preadipocytes comprise a perivascular stem cell population in all fat pads. Further, DHA-FFAR4 signaling synergizes with insulin signaling to direct adipogenic fate change and that FFAR4 agonists rapidly activate localized cAMP in the cilium. To better define the steps in adipogenesis downstream of FFAR4, two genome-wide CRISPR screens for genes important in adipogenesis were conducted, one using a traditional adipogenesis formulation and the other activated by FFAR4 agonists. These screens recapitulated most known requirements
for adipogenesis and provided a wealth of new genes important for the adipogenic program. Among these there is a strong requirement for new factors controlling translation initiation and cap-independent translation. Finally, looking for the importance of FFAR4 in other metabolic systems, the group discovered that all pancreatic islet cell types are ciliated, but that both b and a cells express FFAR4 in cilia. Detailed pharmacology and genetics show that FFAR4 agonists can drive glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in isolated b cells or islets at levels comparable to known secretagogues like GLP-1. FFAR4 agonists also stimulate glucagon secretion in a cells. Both effects require ciliary trafficking. The first Aim will focus on validating and explaining new adipogenesis factors found in the screen. This will focus on identifying specific adenylate cyclases, phosphodiesterases, cAMP effectors, and translational control genes. Aim 2 will focus on FFAR4 signaling in pancreatic b cells to understand the mechanisms of how FFAR4 and cAMP drive insulin secretion and how another w-3 fatty acid receptor, FFAR1, drives calcium influx to cooperate with FFAR4. Finally, in Aim 3, the focus is to use mouse models systematically knocking out both FFAR4 and FFAR1 to examine the cooperation of these pathways in obesity, insulin secretion and diabetes.

ABSTRACT
Innate immune signaling is a key mammalian defense against pathogens. Importantly, these signaling
networks are critically linked to human disease even outside the realm of infections. This facet of innate
immunity remains largely elusive and forms the subject of my research. My thesis focuses on the
pseudokinase RNase L, which is most strongly activated during infection. RNase L is triggered by 2'-5'-linked
iso-RNAs, produced by oligoadenylate synthetases (OASs) upon sensing double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
commonly thought to come from RNA viruses. RNase L is essential for coping with bacterial and viral
infections. RNase L is also a major regulator of cell cycle progression, differentiation, and apoptosis, processes
often misregulated in cancers. Notably, many RNase L mutations predispose men to an elevated risk of
inherited prostate cancer. Moreover, my preliminary results uncover that dampened RNase L expression
strongly correlates with increased breast cancer aggressiveness. The effect of RNase L on tumor suppression
is striking but its molecular mechanism is unclear. My work identifies the first cellular targets of human RNase
L outside infection, tackling a challenge faced since the discovery of RNase L in 1980. Serendipitously, RNase
L targets perfectly overlap with those of a well-established tumor-suppressor, miR-200, and one of their
common targets is the master regulator of metastasis, ZEB1. These results suggest a direct molecular
mechanism for the role of RNase L in controlling metastasis, which I seek to examine during my F99 phase. In
addition, I will isolate endogenous dsRNAs, predicted to be elevated in cancers, which can feed into the
OAS/RNase L axis. Thus, I will test if OASs are a dsRNA surveillance mechanism against not only viruses but
also cancer. This work will uncover the molecular mechanism for a major non-immune function of the
OAS/RNase L axis, informing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against metastasis. My thesis
initiates me into the emerging field of innate immunity in cancer and seeds my postdoctoral research
directions. With rigorous training and an exciting potential to serve human health, I am on a perfect trajectory to
launch an independent career at the forefront of cancer immunology.","102889",

predisposes patients to cardiovascular mortality and lower extremity amputation. There are no treatments to
reverse calcification. Elastin protein has a half-life of >60 years with almost no turnover. During aging and disease
processes, elastic fibers degrade and are prone to calcification. We have developed unique nanoparticles that
can be targeted to degraded elastic lamina in vasculature while sparing healthy arteries. This project is focused
on removing mineral deposits by targeting chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) to the
degraded and calcified elastin in arteries. Then, nanoparticles loaded with pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) will be
targeted to seal calcium-binding sites, inhibit enzymatic degradation, and restore lost elastin to improve vascular
elasticity. Our strong published data show that such targeted EDTA chelation therapy, based on albumin
nanoparticles, reverses experimentally created vascular calcification and avoids possible side effects of systemic
chelation therapy. We would like to take this approach forward in a clinically relevant animal model of chronic

In Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that reversal of elastin-specific vascular calcification is possible
when targeted nanoparticles deliver a chelating agent, EDTA, to the site of vascular calcification in a rat model
of adenine-induced uremia that causes vascular calcification. We will also determine whether calcification returns
after termination of EDTA therapy by monitoring animals for extended periods and whether such therapy has
any adverse effect on bone density and organ health. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that dual
therapy of targeted NPs carrying EDTA (to remove mineralization) followed NPs carrying PGG (to block calcium
binding sites) will prevent return of vascular calcification and improve vascular function irrespective of CKD
disease in a rat model of adenine-induced uremia. Such PGG therapy will also prevent further enzymatic
degradation of elastin and reverse chondro/osteogenic phenotypic change of vascular smooth muscle cells. In
Specific Aim 3, using genetically altered mice, we will test the hypothesis that permanent reversal of calcification
will lead to vascular homeostasis through reversing transdifferentiation of VSMC-osteoblast-like cell transition or

 Despite rapid advances in cancer therapeutic development, acquired drug resistance continues to
threaten the long-term efficacy of existing chemotherapeutic agents, necessitating the expansion of treatment
options targeting novel mechanisms to induce tumor cell death. To that end, induction of ferroptosis, a non-
apoptotic, regulated cell death modality, has been shown to be a promising anti-cancer strategy. To date,
ferroptosis susceptibility has been demonstrated in many cancer cell types, including clear-cell renal carcinoma
and hepatocellular carcinoma25. Ferroptosis has also been shown to be involved in the therapeutic mechanism
of existing therapies including sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, and immune checkpoint blockade
therapy26,27,30. Furthermore, multiple studies have reported that therapy-resistant cancer cells that persist after
conventional first-line drug treatments or that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition exhibit an
increased dependency on a druggable phospholipid hydroperoxidase enzyme, namely glutathione peroxidase
4 (GPX4)22-24, the central component and major inhibitor of the ferroptotic cell death pathway. Therefore,
defining the molecular mechanisms governing ferroptosis will likely reveal potential targets for the development
of novel cancer therapeutics.
 Ferroptosis is characterized by extensive lipid peroxidative damage to biological membranes that
overwhelms the ability of GPX4 to detoxify these lipid reactive oxygen species, eventually leading to cell death.
While the central mechanisms of this regulated cell death pathway have been elucidated, the mediators of
ferroptosis susceptibility are not fully characterized and the molecular signals and events that ultimately result
in cellular demise remain unknown. Our lab and others have demonstrated that widespread changes in the
cellular lipidome occur during ferroptosis, characterized by the significant upregulation of lysophospholipids
and certain polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing diacylglycerols (PUFA-DAGs)2-7. The mechanisms that
mediate these changes and the functions they play in ferroptosis are as yet unknown. In this study, I will use
small molecule dose response, genetic modulation techniques, and lipidomic profiling to investigate the role of
phospholipase A2s (PLA2s, lipid remodeling enzymes that generate lysophospholipids), and PUFA-DAG
signaling pathways in ferroptosis. I propose that specific phospholipase A2 enzymes (specifically, ABHD12,
PLA2G15, and PLA2G10) are active in the removal of key sensitizing lipid species from the membrane and
potentially in the repair of oxidatively damaged membranes during ferroptosis (Aim 1). I further propose that
specific PUFA-DAGs coordinate downstream signaling cascades through activation of certain protein kinase C
subtypes, which have been implicated in oxidative stress pathways15, directing the cell toward cell death (Aim
2). A tipping of the balance between these opposing processes may determine cell fate.","46060",

Obesity is a key risk factor for many secondary chronic illnesses, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular
disease. Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is well-established as an important regulator of mesenchymal cell
fate determination and differentiation, inhibiting adipogenesis and promoting osteoblastogenesis. Emerging
genetic evidence in humans has linked various Wnt pathway members to body fat distribution, obesity, and
metabolic dysfunction, suggesting that this pathway is operative in terminally-differentiated adipocytes. Indeed,
recent studies in mice have uncovered compelling evidence suggesting that the Wnt pathway plays important
roles in adipocyte metabolism, particularly under obesogenic conditions. However, the exact functional roles of
the Wnt pathway and its underlying molecular mechanisms in this context remain unclear. In our initial
experiments to characterize the importance of this pathway in terminally-differentiated adipocytes, we deleted
Wntless, a dedicated intracellular chaperone for Wnt protein secretion, or β-catenin, the central signaling
molecule canonical Wnt pathway from cultured adipocytes and in adipose tissue. Both approaches revealed
that loss of adipocyte-derived Wnts or canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling in adipocytes coordinately down-
regulates lipogenic gene expression, resulting in impaired de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid
monounsaturation. Further, these effects on lipid metabolism are mediated by repression of Srebf1 and Mlxipl,
known master transcriptional regulators of lipogenic enzyme expression. In vivo, deletion of Wntless or β-
catenin does not influence global metabolism in mice maintained on chow diet. However, our studies revealed
a striking phenomenon by which adipose tissues are able to defend adipocyte-specific loss of Wntless or β-
catenin by compensatory up-regulation of Wnt signaling in surrounding stromal-vascular cells. Finally, long-
term overnutrition overrides this compensatory mechanism, such that both Wls-/- and β-cat-/- mice are resistant
to diet-induced obesity and protected from metabolic dysfunction. Herein we propose experiments to
investigate further the roles of Wnt signaling in adipose tissue. Specifically, we will investigate the mechanisms
by which Wnt/β-catenin regulates adipocyte gene expression and cell functions, and how intercellular Wnt
signaling monitors and compensates for the loss of Wnt signaling in adipocytes. Successful completion of
these aims will improve our understanding of how this ancient signaling pathway is critical for the physiology
and pathophysiology of adipose tissues.","444600",

Long-lived plasma cells (LLPC) sustain protective antibody production for a lifetime and are the cellular basis of

definitively linked the long-lived viral serum antibodies to the BM cellular compartment within the healthy human

vitro BM microniche cultures that mimic the BM microenvironment to sustain PC survival. In this application, we
plan (1) to develop a novel in vitro biomarker of vaccine durability using this novel in vitro BM mimic and to
dissect the mechanisms of early blood ASC of long-lived vaccines, acute viral infections, compared to short-lived

study mechanisms of LLPC generation in disease models of Systemic Lupus Erythematosis which is
characterized by high levels of long-lived antibodies and an abundance of LLPC. In summary, these studies will
distinguish the cellular and molecular programs of LLPC generation and maintenance after immunization.","255683",

protein in TNBC and possibly by targeting p27Kip1, which is a cell growth regulator, and microRNA-10b (miR-10b)
which is known as a mediator of invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. However, therapeutic application of
CCN5 remains unknown; this critical knowledge is required before CCN5-based drugs can be developed and
moved into a clinical setting. Thus, the goal of this application is to create and establish an innovative approach
for CCN5 therapy for TNBC growth and metastasis by synthetic modification of CCN5 protein through the
amalgamation of polyethylene glycol (CCN5 PEGylation; PEG-CCN5). In our preliminary studies, we have
demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed method. We have shown that that PEGylation decreases plasma
clearance of CCN5 protein. Treatment of TNBC cells with p27Kip1 and miR-10b targeting PEG-CCN5 results in
blocking cell growth, invasion, and sphere-forming ability, restoring ER-α expression and sensitizing it to
chemotherapy. The results of the in vivo studies suggest that subcutaneous delivery of PEG-CCN5 to tumor-
bearing mice leads to robust tumor uptake and suppresses tumor growth and metastasis. These preliminary
findings form the basis for the current application, in which we propose to extend these studies to identify an
optimal PEG-CCN5 derivative by determining functional efficacy and mechanism of action (Aim 1), MTD,
biodistribution, and toxicity in vitro and in vivo (Aim 2). Finally, antitumor and anti-metastatic efficacy in
combination treatment of anti-hormone, chemotherapy or both will also be determined in cell-derived orthotopic
TNBC xenograft, syngeneic models and PDX model (Aim 3). These studies are expected to identify an optimal
PEGylated protein that will inhibit TNBC growth and progression as well as sensitize TNBC cells to tamoxifen
and Paclitaxel with minimal systemic toxicity or ill effects on healthy cells or organs. These approaches should
significantly advance knowledge on therapeutic utility of CCN5 and its mechanistic insights in the suppression
of TNBC.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) possess the remarkable capacity to self-renew and sustain the entirety of the
blood and immune system throughout the lifetime of an individual. HSC maintenance depends upon signals
and paracrine factors produced by the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment or “niche.” HSC regeneration
following myelotoxicity requires regeneration of vascular ECs within the niche. However, the precise
mechanisms through which BM ECs regulate HSC regeneration remain incompletely understood. Elucidation
of the mechanisms that govern HSC regeneration could have significant medical impact since a substantial
percentage of cancer patients receive HSC-depleting high dose chemotherapy, radiation therapy or
myeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation in the treatment of their disease. Hematopoietic toxicities from
such regimens commonly cause hospitalizations, infectious complications and delays in curative therapy. We
have identified an autocrine mechanism in which BM ECs secrete a protein, semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A), in
response to myelotoxic irradiation, and this protein binds to an EC receptor, NRP1, causing increased BM EC
death and delayed BM vascular regeneration. We hypothesize that targeted inhibition of SEMA3A or its
receptor, NRP1, on BM ECs will block SEMA3A-NRP1 signaling in BM ECs following injury, thereby facilitating
the regeneration of BM ECs and the BM vascular niche wherein HSCs reside. In so doing, we propose that
early restoration of the BM vasculature will promote HSC regeneration and early hematopoietic reconstitution
after myelosuppression. Indeed, our preliminary results suggest that antibody-mediated inhibition of NRP1
decreases BM apoptosis following irradiation and accelerates BM vascular regeneration in irradiated mice.
Importantly, systemic anti-NRP1 treatment also promotes the early recovery of white blood cells, neutrophils,
myeloid progenitor cells, HSCs with long-term repopulating capacity, and increases survival of irradiated mice.
We propose to utilize pharmacologic and cell-specific genetic models to characterize the functions of SEMA3A
and NRP1 in regulating BM vascular regeneration and hematopoietic regeneration. We will also interrogate the
role of integrin function in mediating SEMA3A effects on BM EC function and will evaluate the effects of
modulation of SEMA3A-NRP1 signaling on human BM EC function and human hematopoietic regeneration.
Our broad, long-term objective is to define the role of the SEMA3A-NRP1 pathway in regulating BM vascular
regeneration as a novel platform for therapeutic human hematopoietic regeneration.","375750",

This proposal focuses on cell division cycle 7-related protein (CDC7). The overarching goal of this proposal is
to test whether inhibition of CDC7 kinase might represent a powerful therapeutic strategy in treatment of
human cancers carrying mutated p53 protein. In our study, we will utilize human cancer cell lines as well as a
mouse cancer model. Our work may lead to a novel therapeutic approach for cancer patients, specifically
targeting p53-mutated human cancer cells. CDC7 is a cell cycle kinase that is activated through a physical
interaction with regulatory subunits, DBF4 or DRF1. DRF1 represents the activator of CDC7 during
embryogenesis, while DBF4 functions mainly during divisions of somatic cells. The DBF4-CDC7 kinase
becomes activated at the end of G1 phase and phosphorylates components of the pre-replication complexes
(pre-RCs), thereby triggering entry of cells into DNA synthesis phase (S phase). CDC7 was reported to be
essential for cell division in all organisms studied, from yeast to humans. Several reports documented that
human cancer cells with mutated p53 are particularly sensitive to CDC7 inhibition. Depletion of CDC7 protein,
or inhibition of its kinase activity in p53-mutant cancer cells was shown to trigger tumor cell apoptosis. For
these reasons, we decided to further study the CDC7 protein and its role in normal cell proliferation as well as
in tumorigenesis. Previous work by others has established that CDC7 knockout mice die very early during
gestation, thereby precluding analyses of CDC7 in an adult organism. To circumvent this limitation, and to
study CDC7 function at later stages, our laboratory developed a novel mouse strain that allows us to turn off
CDC7 protein. These mice and cells derived from them offer us tools to study the molecular functions of
CDC7. In Aim 1, we will study the molecular role of CDC7 in cell division of normal, non-transformed cells.
Our preliminary results indicate the presence of a novel, previously unanticipated molecular mechanism of cell
division, which will be examined in this Aim. In Aim 2, we will analyze additional functions of CDC7 in human
cancer cells, through which CDC7 may play important roles in tumorigenesis. In Aim 3, we will utilize a mouse
model that faithfully recapitulates p53-mutant triple-negative breast cancers. Using these mice, we will test the
requirement for CDC7 during tumorigenesis. The expected overall impact of this proposal is that it will change
our understanding of mechanisms governing cell division, will elucidate novel roles of CDC7 in tumorigenesis,
and will test the utility of targeting CDC7 in cancer treatment.","419565",

innovative therapies. BRMS1 is a metastasis suppressor gene that is decreased in LUAD and is associated
with increased cancer migration, invasion, and poor prognosis. Mutations in DNA binding domain (DBD) of p53
are common in LUAD and are associated with increased metastases. We have made a novel observation
that BRMS1 functions as transcription factor for selected metastasis-related genes in p53mut but not
p53WT LUAD. Specifically, we show that BRMS1 binds promoter regions containing active p53 responsive
elements to transcriptionally regulate metastasis-related genes, Maspin and Serpine1, in p53mut but not p53WT
LUAD. Moreover, we demonstrate that BRMS1 expression is related to biologically distinct histologic subtypes
of LUAD and that restoration of BRMS1 using the CK2 inhibitor CX4945 results in significantly less cell
migration and invasion in p53mut compared with p53WT LUAD. Our overarching goal is to determine the
importance of maintaining BRMS1 in the context of p53 mutations using clinically relevant, human LUAD
samples, patient-derived organoids (PDO), and conditional GEMM models. Two Specific Aims will test our
hypotheses: Aim 1) Identify downstream targets and associated components of BRMS1-mediated transcription

LUAD cells. We will then determine the functional significance of BRMS1-DNA binding on transcriptional
regulation by performing RNA-seq in BRMS1WT and BRMS1KO LUAD isogenic cells with different p53 status.
Next, using shRNA screens combined with reporter gene assays to characterize gene-specific components,
we test the hypothesis that BRMS1 differentially regulates transcription via interaction with unique transcription
co-factors in p53mut LUAD. Aim 2) Determine the requirement for BRMS1 in regulating metastases in human
p53mut LUAD. We will leverage our extensive, clinically-annotated biorepository of >2000 human LUAD
specimens with varying p53 mutational profiles, pathologic stages, and histologic subtypes to characterize the
spectrum of LUAD tumors. We then examine the efficacy of the CK2 inhibitor, CX4945, in preventing BRMS1
degradation and decreasing metastases in specific histological subtypes of LUAD using our newly developed
LUAD patient-derived organoid (PDO) model of metastases. We use this PDO model modified with an
inducible expression system to assess the importance of maspin, and serpine1 on BRMS1-mediated
metastasis suppression. Finally, using our newly created Brms1-/-/KrasG12D GEMM with intratracheal delivery of
p53mut CRISPR we create a metastatic LUAD mouse model to assess the requirement of BRMS1 for CX4945-
mediated suppression of metastases. Impact: Our work will provide mechanistic and translational evidence to
support future clinical trials that target BRMS1 in p53mut LUAD with biologically distinct histologic subtypes.","373341",

Hijacking of normal developmental programs is a common mechanism of tumorigenesis and epigenetic
deregulation of developmental transcription programs is central to the genesis of most, if not all, pediatric
cancers. Ewing sarcomas, aggressive bone and soft tissue tumors that predominately arise in adolescence,
continue to be associated with high rates of mortality and novel approaches to therapy are needed. Ewing
sarcomas are characterized by the presence of pathognomonic driver fusion oncogenes, most commonly
EWS/FLI1, and their likely cellular origin is mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSC). EWS/FLI1 initiates
tumorigenesis by inducing widespread disruption of transcriptional regulation as a consequence of altered
recruitment of chromatin remodelers to target gene enhancers and promoters. We have reported that posterior
HOXD genes, in particular HOXD13, are aberrantly over-expressed by Ewing sarcoma and that posterior
HOXD genes contribute to maintenance of the tumorigenic phenotype. Our preliminary studies suggest that
EWS/FLI1 can induce expression of HOXD13, in a cell context dependent fashion, and that this activation is
mediated by aberrant activation of developmental enhancers that are otherwise active in only very discrete
spatiotemporal developmental windows. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies have
demonstrated that in EWS/FLI1+ cells the HOXD13 promoter is preferentially enriched with the MLL-
dependent activating histone modification H3K4me3 and bound by both MLL and menin proteins. Significantly,
exposure of Ewing sarcoma cells to novel small molecule inhibitors of MLL:menin interaction, that are currently
in preclinical development for MLL-fusion positive leukemias, leads to a dramatic loss tumorigenicity and
concomitant loss posterior HOXD gene expression. Thus, these studies demonstrate that that, like MLL-fusion
positive leukemias, maintenance of the oncogenic phenotype of Ewing sarcoma is critically dependent on
MLL:menin-dependent activation of developmental HOX genes. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis
that HOXD13 functions an obligate cooperative oncogene in Ewing sarcoma and that dependency on its
continued expression presents a previously unrecognized tumor-specific vulnerability that can be
therapeutically exploited. In Aim 1 will use innovative Bru-seq technologies and functional validation studies to
define the downstream transcriptional targets of HOXD13 that promote tumorigenicity. In Aim 2 we will use
targeted ChIP assays and chromatin conformation studies to determine how EWS/FLI1 leads to epigenetic
activation of HOXD13. In Aim 3 we will test the therapeutic potential of MI-503, a small molecule inhibitor of
MLL:menin protein:protein interaction, in in vivo tumor models. These studies will together elucidate the
contribution of HOXD13 to Ewing sarcoma pathogenesis and test the potential of a new class of epigenetic
modifying agents for Ewing sarcoma-targeted therapies.","387672",

HCC is one of the most common cancers worldwide, accounting for an estimated 600,000 deaths annually.
The incidence of HCC has increased in the United States over the past 25 years and the incidence of and
mortality rate for HCC are expected to double over the next 10 to 20 years. The increased incidence rate
is exacerbated by high mortality rate of HCC. The overall five-year survival rates of patients with HCC in
the United States are around 16%, making HCC the most lethal cancer type after pancreatic cancer.
Despite its importance, HCC is understudied compared to other major lethal cancers, and hence, our
knowledge of the genetic or epigenetic alterations associated with the initiation, progression, and clinical
outcomes of HCC is still fragmentary. Furthermore, there is only a limited arsenal of treatment options for
HCC as less than one-third of patients with HCC are eligible for potentially curative treatments such as
resection, transplantation, or percutaneous ablation. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic
and anti-proliferative effects, has been shown to improve survival in these patients, and has become the
standard of care in advanced HCC. However, unfortunately, benefit of sorafenib treatment appears to be
marginal extending only 2.8 months of overall survival and a dismal response rate of only 2%, highlighting
the urgent need for new targeted agents or finding new ways to overcome resistant to sorafenib.
 By analyzing proteomic and genomic data from human HCC, we uncovered three molecularly and
clinically distinct proteomic subtype of HCC. Analysis with integrated proteomic data with genomic data
further showed that PEA15 is highly amplified in HCC genome and its amplification and expression are
significantly associated with poor prognosis. Its amplification is not limited to HCC as amplified in bladder
cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. We demonstrated that PEA15 is up-regulated in vast majority of
HCC cell lines and it is essential for proliferation and survival of HCC cells. We further demonstrated that
PEA15 promotes invasion of cancer. Our study also showed HCC cells with high PEA15 expression is
accountable for angiogenesis.
 In proposed study, we aim to (1) determine roles of PEA15 in HCC developments. (2) determine
roles of PEA15 in angiogenesis. (3) determine if PEA15 is good therapeutic targets for treatment of
HCC. If successful, this will open up new opportunity for development of novel therapeutic approaches for
poor prognostic patients with HCC. Furthermore, knowledge obtained from this study can be used in other

The proposed research is relevant to public health because health care costs associated with care for elderly
individuals suffering from age-related stem cell disorders, such as myeloproliferative diseases or
myelodysplastic syndromes, are rapidly increasing. Despite emerging experimental evidence that HSC myeloid
bias is as a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of these conditions, it cannot be targeted by currently
available pharmacological agents. Our discovery of Sema4a as a specific niche-derived regulator of myeloid-
biased HSC will open a new avenue in therapeutics directed at preservation of stem cell function with age and
prevention of myeloid disease development. These aims closely align with the NIH SHINE initiative (PAS-19-

Despite substantial experimental evidence for the important functional role of myeloid-biased HSC (myHSC) in
stress, inflammation and aging, the mechanisms which control myHSC quiescence and self-renewal are not
known. The long-term goal of this project is to understand how myHSC self-renewal can be regulated by the
bone marrow microenvironment in order to identify novel signaling pathways that can be activated to enhance
hematopoietic regeneration, and blocked if they become dysregulated in myeloid malignancy. The overall
objective in this application is to understand at the mechanistic level how Sema4a, a newly-defined niche
factor, selectively promotes quiescence and self-renewal of myHSC, and to test potential therapeutic utility of
its pro-regenerative effect in clinically relevant models of proliferative stress and HSC exhaustion. The central
hypothesis is that Sema4a is released from osteoprogentiors and endothelial cells in the bone marrow
microenvironment and binds to Plexin D1 on myHSC, which triggers a cascade of inhibitory signals that shield
myHSC from exhaustion, premature differentiation and DNA damage. The rationale for this project is that
identification of Sema4a-induced myHSC-specific pathways and testing their protective effect on myHSC in
pre-clinical models of proliferative stress is likely to offer a strong scientific framework for future therapeutic
strategies to improve myHSC self-renewal and hematopoietic regeneration. The central hypothesis will be
tested under two specific aims: 1) Determine molecular and cellular mechanisms of Sema4a effects on
myHSC; and 2) Define therapeutic opportunities for Sema4a as a myHSC “protector” from proliferative stress.
Under the first aim, genetic mouse models, single-cell RNA Sequencing and intravital microscopy will be used
to evaluate the effect of microenvironmental deletion of Sema4a or its putative receptor, Plexin D1, on myHSC
and to uncover the role of Sema4a as myHSC-specific hematopoietic regulator. Under the second aim, my-
HSC protective properties of Sema4a will be explored in clinically relevant models of functional HSC loss, such
as exposure to cytotoxic chemotherapy and ex-vivo HSC culture during gene modification procedure. The
research proposed in this application is innovative, in candidate’s opinion, because it builds on a novel
discovery of Sema4a as a potent and indispensable regulator of myHSC in vivo, and provides substantive new
experimental evidence for the concept that functionally specialized HSC are controlled by distinct regulatory
circuits. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to serve as a scientific justification for
future therapeutic strategies to improve hematopoietic regeneration following chemotherapy and stem cell
transplantation, enhance engraftment of gene-modified HSC and prevent myeloid bias, age-related HSC
dysfunction and evolution to myeloid malignancy in the elderly.","438321",

Abstract:
Long-lived plasma cells (LLPC) sustain protective antibody production for a lifetime and are the cellular basis of
vaccine durability and require the bone marrow (BM) microniche to sustain survival. In our lab, we have
definitively linked the long-lived viral serum antibodies to the BM cellular compartment within the healthy human

vitro BM microniche cultures that mimic the BM microenvironment to sustain PC survival. In this application, we
plan (1) to develop a novel in vitro biomarker of vaccine durability using this novel in vitro BM mimic and to
dissect the mechanisms of early blood ASC of long-lived vaccines, acute viral infections, compared to short-lived

study mechanisms of LLPC generation in disease models of Systemic Lupus Erythematosis which is

Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease (ILD) of older adults characterized
by disruption of distal lung architecture that ultimately leads to scar formation, abnormal gas exchange, and
respiratory failure. A key barrier to developing better therapeutic outcomes for IPF has been a dearth of
translationally relevant preclinical models. Based on a recent paradigm shift wherein the concepts of repetitive
injury to a dysfunctional, vulnerable, alveolar epithelium coupled with an abnormal wound healing response are
postulated as disease “drivers”, new opportunities are emerging for therapeutic discovery in IPF. Mutations in
the alveolar type 2 cell (AT2) restricted, Surfactant Protein C [SP-C] gene [SFTPC], have been found in
sporadic and familial IPF and provide important clues for understanding IPF pathogenesis. To address the
unmet need for IPF patients, this proposal builds upon on a strong foundation of our prior work characterizing
the cell biology of SP-C biosynthesis that culminated in generation of two novel knock-in mouse models of
spontaneous lung fibrosis already in hand which express clinical SP-C mutants in AT2 cells in an allelic and
inducible fashion. Our Published Data has demonstrated that clinical IPF associated SFTPC mutations
produce aberrant SP-C proprotein isoforms that functionally segregate into 2 AT2 phenotypes: ER stress
induced by intracellular SP-C misfolding (BRICHOS) or autophagy/mitophagy impaired from proSP-C
mistrafficking to non-native organelles (Non-BRICHOS). When expressed in the lung epithelium in vivo, both
the non-BRICHOS mutant (SftpcI73T) and the BRICHOS mutant (SftpcC121G) are extremely toxic to the lung and
each is sufficient to evoke a time-dependent, physiologically restrictive peripheral fibrotic lung phenotype that
elaborates translationally relevant biomarkers reported in human IPF. This proposal will leverage these unique
models for Discovery, Target ID/ Validation, and Proof of Concept studies aimed at mapping cell
subpopulations and uncovering novel pathways driving lung fibrosis whilst providing a compelling translational
platform to interface with other preclinical/translational platforms in this U01 consortium to accelerate IPF
therapeutic development. In 3 specific aims, we propose to utilize Sftpc mutant mice to map cell populations,
transcriptomic profiles, and cell-cell crosstalk repertoires arising during evolution of spontaneous fibrotic lung
phenotypes [Specific Aim 1], identify novel disease relevant biomarker candidates elaborated during the
aberrant injury-repair process [Specific Aim 2], and assess the important contributions of and mechanisms by
which aging and sex impact IPF phenotypes [Specific Aim 3]. Importantly, many of the endpoints defined in
Sftpc models will be cross-validated and contextualized using lung tissue and serum from a well-phenotyped
human IPF biorepository. When completed, the impactful deliverables produced from this project will include a
new platform to better understand IPF pathogenesis from its onset through disease progression and serve as a
resource for the broader research community to identify and test novel therapies to treat this disease.","721248",

therapeutic modalities. PDAC tumors are very heterogeneous carrying alterations in many critical pathways
and require a broad form of therapy that can activate multiple tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs)
simultaneously. We have shown that in PDAC over-expression of the nuclear exporter protein Exportin 1
(XPO1) leads to functional inactivation of TSPs (such as FOXO3a, p27, Par-4) through their mislocalization.
We were the first to demonstrate that inhibition of XPO1 by CRISPR/Cas9 validated Selective Inhibitor of
Nuclear Export (SINE) selinexor and analogs can restore the anti-tumor function of multiple TSPs leading to
PDAC cell death and tumor inhibition in orthotopic models. More significantly, our findings show that SINE
synergize with gemcitabine (GEM) and nab-paclitaxel leading to enhanced PDAC growth inhibition, apoptosis,
reversal of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and spheroid disintegration of PDAC derived cancer
stem cells (CSCs). The observed synergy was due in part to enhanced nuclear localization of TSPs and
suppression of CSC and EMT markers. Pathway analysis showed enhancement in cell death signaling and
suppression of CSC sustaining networks. Most importantly we observed activation of fibroblast specific cell
death pathways highlighting an as of yet unexplored role of XPO1 in sustaining fibroblast growth that is
recognized to support high desmoplastic reaction (DR) in PDAC. Our multi-model pre-clinical work has led to a
Phase Ib/II clinical study involving GEM-nab-paclitaxel-selinexor for metastatic PDAC (NCT02178436). In this
proposal we hypothesize that XPO1 inhibition will enforce the nuclear retention of TSPs, restore their anti-
tumor function leading to enhancement of cytotoxic efficacy of GEM-nab-paclitaxel in PDAC. To validate our
hypothesis, we propose to integrate high-throughput RNA-Seq and SILAC-MS methodologies in primary
cellular and transgenic mice models and in a Phase Ib/II trial combining selinexor with Gem-nab-paclitaxel in
PDAC patients. We anticipate that our holistic analyses will, for the first time, delineate the impact of XPO1
inhibition in re-programming of PDAC CSC and DR networks that leads to the enhancement in the efficacy of
GEM-nab-paclitaxel in tumors. In Aim1 we will demonstrate in vitro synergy between GEM-nab-paclitaxel and
selinexor in primary PDAC models using high-throughput methodologies. In Aim2 we will demonstrate the
efficacy and synergy of GEM-nab-paclitaxel-selinexor in LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+;Pdx-1-Cre mice
model. These studies will identify sensitivity and/or resistance markers that will support our phase Ib/II trial in
Aim3 in which we intend to determine the safety and efficacy of selinexor when combined with GEM-nab-
paclitaxel in patients with metastatic PDAC. Biopsies from this trial will be used to validate locked
pharmacodynamic markers of selinexor target engagement in patients. Clinical Impact: The successful
completion our studies will bring forward a new therapy to improve the survival of patients with PDAC.","317047",

diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States (U.S.) each year, and 40,000 women will
die of breast cancer this year alone. Basal-like breast cancer accounts for 15-20% of all
diagnosed breast cancer depending on patient population. These patients are commonly
known as triple negative breast cancer because most cases often lack expression of
estrogen receptor α (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER-2). The absence of PR, ERa, and HER-2 commonly found in basal-like
breast cancer leads to these patients unlikely to respond to hormone therapies or HER-2
targeted therapies. Thus, basal-like breast cancer is highly aggressive, and often results in
lung and brain metastasis. Understanding risk factors for basal-like breast cancer invasion
and metastasis is urgently needed for identification of novel and specific molecular targets.
Because women represent the fastest growing demographic in the US Veteran population,
breast cancer is an increasingly significant public health issue for the Veterans Health
Administration. Our proposed studies will investigate the transition from early-stage basal-like
breast cancer to invasive breast cancer.
Objectives: Palmitic acid is one of the predominant saturated fatty acids in the western diet.
The goal of this study is to determine how high-palmitic acid (HPA) intake acts as a risk
factor to facilitate basal-like breast cancer invasion. Based on our preliminary studies, we
hypothesize that HPA increases the endothelial lipase ( LIPG) activity, which is a key driver
of invasive progression in early-stage basal-like breast cancer. We also hypothesize that
HPA initiates defective myoepithelial cell differentiation or loss of the mature myoepithelium,
which allows tumor cell invasion.
Methods: Specific Aim 1 will examine how HPA converts quiescent LIPG-negative tumor
cells into LIPG-positive tumor-initiating cells for early-stage basal-like breast cancer invasion.
Specific Aim 2 will investigate how LIPG signaling pathways contribute to loss of normal
myoepithelial cell function in HPA conditions. We have initiated studies screening natural
compounds combined with computational drug discovery approaches, and identified a potent
LIPG inhibitor DDL-1. Specific Aim 3 will determine if inhibition of LIPG prevents early-stage
basal-like breast cancer to invasive breast cancer progression in HPA conditions. We have
developed a new nanoparticle-based drug delivery system to deliver DDL-1 into mammary
myoepithelial cells and tumor cells. We will use mouse models of early-stage basal-like breast
cancer to study the effect of DDL-1 administration on the incidence of invasive breast cancer
and circulating tumor cells in HPA conditions.
Results: By identifying a mechanism by which breast cancer invasion occurs, we are hopeful

Completion of both
endochondral and intramembranous ossification entails a highly intricate but well-coordinated process of
patterning, cell fate commitment, differentiation, growth, and remodeling. These events are specified by a
coordinated temporal and spatial pattern of gene expression. At first, secreted morphogens such as
hedgehog, bone morphogenetic proteins, wingless proteins, and others, signal to key transcription factors
to specify gene expression. Runx2 is an essential transcription factor for both chondrocyte and osteoblast
differentiation. Runx2 gene deletion results in embryonic lethality due to a complete failure of bone
formation. In humans, mutation of the Runx2 gene causes cleidocranial dysplasia, a dominantly inherited
skeletal disorder. Another master regulator of skeletogenesis is the Specificity protein-7 (Sp7). Sp7 belongs
to the Sp subgroup of the Krüppel-like family of transcription factors characterized by three zinc-finger DNA-
binding domains. Deletion of Sp7 gene results in failure of osteoblasts, and bone formation. In humans,
mutation of the Sp7 gene is linked with the recessive form of osteogenesis imperfecta, skeletal fragility and
delayed tooth eruption. However, very little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism for the
surprisingly similar phenotype from the two seemingly unrelated proteins. Runx2 is required for the
expression of Sp7, as mice with targeted disruption of the Runx2 gene completely lack expression of Sp7.
In sharp contrast, the Runx2 expression is normal in the skeletal cells of Sp7 null animals. The functional
incompetency of Runx2 in the Sp7 null mice suggests that Sp7 presence is obligatory for completion of the
Runx2 osteogenic activity. It is important to note that the observation of Runx2 expression in Sp7 null mice
is limited to only RNA, determined by in situ hybridization of embryonic tissues. Our data show that despite
normal levels of Runx2 mRNA, Runx2 protein is highly unstable in skeletal tissues of Sp7 null mice. We
further demonstrate that Runx2 and Sp7 proteins form a molecular complex and their transcriptional activity
is regulated by unique posttranslational modifications. Our findings strongly suggest that in skeletal cells,
Sp7 acts as a molecular rheostat and is necessary for functional stability and turnover of Runx2 protein.
Our experiment will assess endogenous levels of Runx2 protein in Sp7 null background and by a regulated
and selective gene reconstitution in osteoprogenitor cells. The goal of this application is to identify and
define a) spatial and temporal organization and assembly of Runx2 and Sp7 regulatory complexes for the
formation and/or maintenance of osteoblasts and b) mechanisms supporting the stable complex formation
and retention of competency for skeletal gene expression. Knowledge obtained from this study will provide
molecular insights into components of a bone regulatory complex that can be targeted for innovative
therapy to improve cartilage and bone formation and repair.","318703",

Basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) consistently expresses genes typical of normal basal/myoepithelial cells of the
breast and comprises up to 25% of all breast cancer. It is associated with aggressive clinical behavior and a
high rate of metastasis to the lung. The organ-preferential metastasis of BLBC is poorly understood. Of note,
the vast majority of breast tumors arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers display a basal-like phenotype. Little is
currently known about the molecular basis of the tissue and subtype-specific features of BRCA1-mutant breast
cancer. We found that the transcription factor FOXC1 is exclusively induced in BLBC including BRCA1-mutant
breast cancer and correlates with poor clinical outcome. It regulates breast cancer cell function by inducing NF-
κB and other cancer-associated signaling pathways. Its overexpression in the mouse mammary gland
increases the luminal progenitor population, which is postulated to be the cell of origin of BRCA1-mutant breast
cancer. We also found that FOXC1 and its targets CXCL1, 2, and 8 chemokines are essential for BLBC lung
metastasis. These chemokines act in concert with lung fibroblasts to induce endothelial cell migration in vitro.
We therefore hypothesize that FOXC1 counteracts the detrimental effects of BRCA1 mutations in breast cells
and plays a critical role in basal-like BRCA1-mutant breast cancer development. In addition, we hypothesize
that the chemokines CXCL1, 2, and 8 mediate the effect of FOXC1 on BLBC lung metastasis by engaging lung
fibroblasts to induce angiogenesis. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of FOXC1 in the development of
BRCA1-mutant breast cancer with the basal-like phenotype. BRCA1-mutant breast cancer cell models will be
used to test whether FOXC1 signaling pathways regulate cell function and counteracts the increase of reactive
oxygen species in breast epithelial cells with BRCA1 mutations or deficiency. We will determine whether
FOXC1 regulates mammary tumorigenesis in BRCA1-mutant xenograft models and a mammary-specific
BRCA1-deficient mouse model. In Aim 2, we will define a FOXC1/chemokine-mediated mechanism for BLBC
lung metastasis. Tail vein injection mouse models will be used to investigate whether the FOXC1-induced
chemokines promote the proliferation and survival of metastatic breast cancer cells in the lung tissue
microenvironment. We will determine whether FOXC1 overexpression in BLBC leads to increased
angiogenesis in lung metastases mediated by chemokine-directed crosstalk between metastatic breast cancer
cells and lung fibroblasts. We will further investigate the mechanism whereby FOXC1 regulates the three
chemokines in BLBC cells. Basal-like BRCA1-mutant breast cancer development and BLBC metastasis are
poorly understood areas that are of paramount importance in breast cancer. Our results will shed light on their
biological basis and will lay down a foundation for new approaches that can prevent and treat FOXC1-
overexpressing breast cancer.","374062",

Bacterial meningitis is the most common serious infection of the central nervous system (CNS) and a major
cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in children. Although antibiotic therapy has changed
bacterial meningitis from a uniformly fatal disease to an often curable one, the overall outcome remains
unfavorable, with mortality of 5 to 10% and permanent neurologic sequelae occurring in 5 to 40% of survivors,
depending on patient age and pathogen. Disruption and dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a
hallmark event in the pathophysiology of bacterial meningitis. Little is known, however, about the very first and
crucial interaction between a bacterial pathogen with the BBB that initiates this chain of events, and may
ultimately determine a poor or favorable neurological outcome in meningitis patients. This proposal seeks to
elucidate the molecular mechanisms of BBB disruption during bacterial infection, and why it fails as a
neuroprotective barrier during bacterial meningitis. We have shown that bacterial infection induces an epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT) program in endothelial cells (EndoMT), disrupting tight junctions in BBB
endothelium through the upregulation of host transcription factor Snail1, a global repressor of tight junctions.
Further, we have discovered that a bacterial adhesin interacts directly with vimentin, an intermediate filament
protein that is induced during EMT/EndoMT. I hypothesize that BBB disruption may be due to the combined
effect of bacterial entry and modulation of host signaling pathways that results in compromised barrier function.
Further that bacterial pathogens associated with CNS disease possess the unique ability to penetrate brain
endothelium, which ultimately leads to BBB dysfunction. These hypotheses will be addressed with both in vitro
and in vivo models of BBB penetration using Group B streptococcus (GBS) as a model human pathogen
associated with meningitis. AIM 1: Characterize the bacterial determinant(s) that initiate Snail1 activation and
the contribution of Snail1 to BBB breakdown during GBS meningitis; AIM 2: Characterize the host factors that
contribute to Snail1 activation during GBS infection; AIM 3: Determine the contribution of GBS-vimentin
interaction to BBB penetration and the development of meningitis. These studies should increase our
understanding of the bacterial and host factors involved in the interaction with brain endothelium that leads to
barrier disruption, pathogen transit into the brain, and disease progression.","323112",

only modestly effective. Tyrosine kinase inhibition with Nindedanib has proven to be a successful therapeutic
strategy for a number of pulmonary fibrosis disorders. However, due to the nonspecificity of Nintedanib it is
unclear which tyrosine kinases are most critical for driving fibrosis. Future mechanistic studies should focus on
identifying specific tyrosine kinases and cell types involved in fibrosis which may enable more precise targeting
of critical pro-fibrotic pathways. We have identified discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) as an attractive
therapeutic target. DDR2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor activated by fibrillar collagens such as type I collagen
and we have recently shown that type I collagen signaling promotes further fibroblast activation leading to a
feed forward/postive feedback loop culminating in progressive fibrosis. Furthermore, unlike DDR1, which is
highly expressed by many cell types, DDR2 expression is heavily skewed with much higher expression on
fibroblasts than other cell types. This is critical because we have recently reported that activation of ubiquitous
intracellular signaling pathways can have opposing effects on fibrosis depending on the cell type with pro-
fibrotic activation within fibroblasts but anti-fibrotic effects within epithelial cells. Thus, DDR2 may enable more
specific targeting of fibroblasts which are the primary fibrogenic effector cells. Recently a novel DDR2-specific
inhibitor has been shown to improve outcome in a model of lung cancer through inhibition of cancer associated
fibroblasts and DDR2-expressing cancer cells which have undergone mesenchymal transition. In preliminary
data we find that this inhibitor is also effective at inhibiting fibrosis. Our preliminary data also support a novel
mechanism by which DDR2 signaling regulates PIK3C2α, a poorly understood member of the PI3 kinase
family which has recently been shown to regulate TGFβ receptor internalization necessary for TGFβ signaling.
PIK3Cα has also been shown to regulate PDK1/Akt signaling consistent with our report that DDR2 regulates
fibroblast survival through PDK1/Akt. Finally, a recent report found that targeting fibroblast specific markers
using a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell approach was effective at attenuating cardiac fibrosis.
Collectively, this support our central hypothesis that DDR2 promotes fibrosis through fibroblast specific effects
on PIK3C2α/TGFβ signaling, resistance to apoptosis via PIK3C2α/PDK/Akt signaling and that DDR2
represents an attractive target for anti-fibrotic therapy. In addition to testing the importance of DDR2 with a
small molecule inhibitor, given skewed high fibroblast expression of DDR2, we will develop CAR-NK cells
targeting DDR2 for immunotherapy of pulmonary fibrosis. Unlike T cells, NK cells are not MHC restricted, do
not undergo clonal expansion and may therefore serve as off-the shelf therapeutic solution with minimum
toxicity. These studies will advance our understanding of a critical pro-fibrotic signaling pathway as well as
advance and refine the potential for adapting CAR immunotherapy for fibrosis.","618378",

druggable PDAC driver, and it can be suppressed by Zoledronic acid (ZA) under tissue culture conditions.
Regrettably, the weak availability in the target tissue limits the therapeutic efficacy of ZA. Thus, the goal of this
proposal is to evaluate a new approach for an iRGD-mediated-hypoxic/pH-responsive nanocarriers (ZA-iPRNCs)
based therapy, which can efficiently release ZA from the nano-capsule exclusively in the hypoxic

iPRNCs in different PDAC cell lines. We have also obtained results indicating that after intravenous delivery to
tumor-bearing mice, ZA-iPRNCs lead to robust tumor uptake detectable by in vivo imaging and, importantly,
results in suppression of CYR61 expression and tumor growth. Building on these exciting preliminary findings,
we now propose to unravel the mechanism of regulation of CYR61 by ZA, and determine whether ZA, via
blocking CYR61, inhibits PDAC growth and metastatic progression as well as makes cancer cells sensitive to
GEM using genetically engineered cell lines and mouse models. Further, we will also explore an additive impact
of nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane, NPac) on GEM sensitivity in tumor-bearing mice treated with ZA-iPRNCs, GEM,

nano carrier-based ZA therapy alone or in a combination of ZA-iPRNCs, GEM, and NPac leads to improved
tumor control and mouse survival in KPC and PDX mouse models. To achieve these aims, we have standardized
a non-invasive ultrasound imaging technique that reveals the various steps of tumor progression in mouse
models. With the help of these techniques and the unique collaborative expertise of the multidisciplinary team,
we will establish a new therapeutic approach for future clinical trials."," ",

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Allograft rejection remains an issue in long term success of allotransplantation and is also likely to negatively
impact the function and longevity of tissue engineered grafts being explored as a possible solution to the
shortage of available organs. In the direct pathway of allorecognition, rejection is typically initiated by activation
of resting host T effector memory cells that cross-react with non-self MHC/peptide complexes, a process that
requires graft cells to provide additional signals such as co-stimulators and cytokines. Graft cells capable of
doing this are “immunogenic”. Such T cells then differentiate into effector cells that are capable of killing cells
that express the same non-self MHC/peptide complexes. Graft cell types that express the same alloantigens
and can be recognized and killed by effector T cells but are unable to initiate the differentiation of resting
effector memory into effector T cells are said to be “antigenic” rather than immunogenic. Two immunogenic
human cell types implicated in initiating rejection are graft dendritic cells (DCs) and graft endothelial cells
(ECs). While DCs (and other passenger leukocytes) can be purged from a natural graft or left out of a
bioengineered graft, ECs are essential for lining the blood vessels that sustain graft viability. We have
proposed strategies to reduce rejection by limiting the immunogenicity of the graft to complement the current
practice of suppressing the host immune response. It is unclear if removing DCs and altering ECs to be non-
immunogenic will be sufficient to protect a graft from rejection. Here we propose to answer this question.
Addressing this question requires that it be performed with human ECs because commonly used rodent ECs
do not exhibit the same immunogenic capabilities as their human counterparts. To do so, we will bring to bear
5 novel technologies: a). genetic engineering of ECs to render them non-immunogenic and non-antigenic; b).
nanomedicine to modulate the immunogenic capacity of ECs; c). 3D printing of a human skin composed of
multiple different cell types as a target for rejection; d). a state-of-the-art human immune system mouse as a
graft recipient; and e). cutting edge high dimensional serial immunofluorescence to determine the effects of our
interventions on the rejection process. We will initially test our model mouse model and optimize our assays
using natural human skin (aim 1) and then proceed to test our 3D skin constructs (aim 2) in which we will
modify cell types to determine the role, if any, of human cells other than ECs and DCs. We acknowledge that
there is some risk in a proposal that merges multiple technologies which have not been previously combined
and therefore have chosen to use the R21 exploratory mechanism to support this research. However, the
successful conduct of this project will not only provide an initial answer to an important question for human skin
cells, but will also create a platform for further studies of allotransplantation with more complex human tissues
and provide valuable insights for bioengineering of replacement organs.","209375",

This R01 competitive renewal application focuses on a novel mechanism of acquired resistance to hormone
therapy in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) called lineage plasticity. During the initial 5 year
funding cycle, we focused primarily on two other mechanisms of resistance: mutation or amplification of the
androgen receptor (AR) and bypass of AR signaling through upregulation of the closely related glucocorticoid
receptor. This work is described briefly in the Progress Report section of the Research Strategy and in the
papers cited in the Progress Report Publication List. Here we shift our attention to a third mechanism of
acquired resistance that we recently reported called lineage plasticity, in which prostate cancers escape
hormone therapy by changing their identity from an AR dependent luminal lineage phenotype to an AR
independent non-luminal lineage. This resistance mechanism occurs primarily in tumors deficient in the tumor
suppressor genes TP53 and RB1 (which account for ~15% of CRPC) and is explained, in part, by upregulation
of the reprogramming factor SOX2 which enables luminal epithelial cells to acquire characteristics of basal
epithelial, mesenchymal and neuroendocrine cells that are no longer dependent on AR signaling for survival.
We have developed genetically-defined mouse and human prostate cancer models (using organoid
technology, xenografts and orthotopic tumor models) that recapitulate all the phenotypes of lineage plasticity
observed in CRPC patients with reproducible, defined kinetics that make these models suitable for detailed
mechanistic investigation. In Aim 1, we will identify the regulators of these lineage transitions, starting with a
series of timecourse experiments using RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, chromatin ChIP-seq and single cell RNA-seq to
define the transcriptomic and chromatin landscape changes associated with these changing phenotypes. Aim
2 will address the mechanism by which antiandrogen therapy can accelerate the development of lineage
plasticity, which we postulate is through disruption of an AR-driven transcriptional program that helps maintain
luminal identity. The results could have implications for the timing and context in which hormone therapy is
used clinically. In Aim 3, we will identify candidate drug targets that block the development of lineage plasticity
by conducting a pooled CRISPR screen of a library focused exclusively on chromatin modifying enzymes
(selected based on our recent data implicating EZH2 as one such target). We will characterize the hits from
this screen with the long range goal of developing combination therapy regimens (with antiandrogen therapy)
that prevent resistance. In summary, this application will generate novel mechanistic insight into lineage
plasticity in prostate cancer, with obvious implications for the clinical challenge of drug resistance. The findings
are also likely to have relevance for other epithelial tumor types such as lung cancer, breast cancer and
melanoma where evidence implicating lineage plasticity as a cause of drug resistance has also emerged.","363690",

contributing to incomplete surgical resection and inevitable tumor recurrence. A better understanding of the
specific molecular pathways responsible for cell infiltration in GBM may thus provide novel and potentially more
effective opportunities for therapy. The biology of tumor cell infiltration/migration is complex and intimately
linked to its microenvironment, including adaptations for unique metabolic, hypoxic, motility, extracellular
matrix, and neuroinflammatory stressors. The pathways are difficult to recapitulate in glioma models that rely
on cell culturing. As cell fate decisions converge on the level of epigenetic control, one attractive strategy
to study the intricate biology of migration is to use epigenetics to define the transcriptional regulators of
migration in a system that closely resembles the native tumor cell state. In this proposal, we take advantage of
our lab's epigenetic expertise to study cell fate states in glioma stem cell populations (GSCs), directly
isolated from their tumor niche without pre-culture artifact [37-38,57]. Through the unique comparison of
open chromatin in freshly derived GSCs and normal germinal matrix progenitors, we were able to distinguish
the transcriptionally accessible regions in GSCs that specifically relate to cell migration (in final revisions). This
allowed us to infer the most salient transcription factor (TF) motifs within tumor-specific regulatory regions
linked to migration, where the TEAD family emerged as a top candidate. The TEAD TFs, along with their co-
activators YAP/TAZ, are the main effectors of the Hippo pathway, and have been studied for their oncogenic
regulatory role predominantly outside of the brain. To test the functional role of YAP-TEAD in GBM growth and
migration, we generated TEAD1 knockout in patient-derived GSCs using CRISPR/Cas9 and employed the
YAP-TEAD inhibitor, Verteporfin, to inhibit TEAD activity. Using both methods to inhibit TEAD1 activity, we
detected reduced capacity for cell migration in vitro and robust downregulation of EGFR and pERK expression.
EGFR knockout similarly displayed reduced migration in vitro, as well as decreased TEAD activity.
Based on this, here we hypothesize that TEAD activity regulates infiltrative growth in GBM, mediated at
least partially through an EGFR regulatory loop. To test this hypothesis, we aim to 1) systematically define
TEAD occupancy at open chromatin and downstream TEAD-target genes across GBM subtypes; 2a) dissect
mechanistically the relationship between Hippo-YAP/TAZ-TEAD and EGFR/RTK-ERK; 2b) define the role of
TEAD1 in regulating migration and growth in vitro and in/ex vivo, and its synergy with EGFR; and 3) test the
potential therapeutic efficacy of YAP-TEAD inhibitors, such as Verteporfin. We envision YAP/TAZ-TEAD as an
important regulator of infiltrative growth in GBM, where pharmacologic inhibition of its activity alleviates tumor
burden while also blocking oncogenic RTK effects, thus offering new therapeutic options for patients with GBM.","333702",

SCC prognosis is
context-dependent and does not seem to be determined by driver gene somatic mutations, which are similar
across different body sites and pathological grades. Our study of SCC arising in the rare genetic skin disease
Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) has identified genetic similarities between this deadly,
tissue damage-driven cancer, and a related cancer arising in the oral cavity, termed head and neck SCC
(HNSCC). Our unpublished research into HNSCC has demonstrated that this similarity extends beyond genetics
and has identified the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM) within the tumor microenvironment as a
potential predictor of poor outcome. Our current proposal leverages the similarities between RDEB and certain
sub-types of HNSCC to explore initiation and progression events that are likely driven by different environmental
stimuli but which result in the same outcome; SCC with poor prognosis. In RDEB, ~90% of patients develop
cutaneous SCC by age 55 and 5-year survival is close to 0%. SCC in the skin of RDEB patients arise within
chronic wounds, an environment quite different to most head and neck cancers. Nevertheless, analysis of
mutations in these tumors suggests that similar mechanisms are driving tumor initiation, and analysis of gene
expression and ECM proteins suggests that similar mechanisms also drive tumor progression. We have
developed a novel assay of mutation in cultured keratinocytes which will determine the extent of existing mutation
in single cells isolated from peri-tumoral, normal-appearing tissue, a tissue region that is prone to cancer
development (a phenomenon known as ‘field cancerization’). Using this approach, we will also determine the
relationship between elements associated with risk factors in HNSCC, and mutagenesis driven by endogenous
deaminases of the AID (activation-induced cytidine deaminase) and APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing
enzyme, catalytic polypeptide) family, which have been shown to be active in all SCC genomes. To address the
role of ECM in progression of SCC, we will utilize a novel assay of tissue fibrosis that recapitulates the continual
collagen remodeling observed in SCC fibroblasts (in both RDEB and HNSCC) when compared with normal
fibroblasts isolated from the same patient which do not exhibit such collagen remodeling. We will interrogate the
role of thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) in driving tumor cell invasion through two separate but related mechanisms,
activation of transforming growth factor-beta signaling and regulation of ECM secretion. In parallel, we will
determine the timing of mutational processes resulting from tissue damage by assessing mutation acquisition in
APOBEC transgenic animals. Importantly, these studies will also enable us to evaluate APOBEC inhibition as
a potential preventative or treatment intervention for SCC in a pre-clinical setting. Together, our integrated in
vitro and in vivo studies will provide the rationale and platform to develop clinically relevant strategies for
improved SCC treatment and prevention.","321165",

This is an application for a K08 for Dr. Stephanie Gaw Valderramos, an Assistant Professor in Maternal-
Fetal Medicine at the University of California at San Francisco who is establishing herself as a young
investigator in multidisciplinary translational studies of placental malaria. This award will provide Dr.
Valderramos with the support necessary to test the theory that placental malaria causes local inflammatory
changes in the placenta, leading to dysregulation of placental function and consequently fetal growth
restriction. To achieve this goal, Dr. Valderramos has assembled a mentoring team comprised of Dr. Susan
Fisher, an expert in placental biology; Dr. Philip Rosenthal, an international expert in translational studies of
malaria; and Dr. Margaret Feeney, an expert in pediatric immune responses to malaria. Little is known
about placental development in the setting of malaria, despite fact that maternal infection is responsible for
up to 35% of low birth weight infants, and that in high transmission areas, up to 70% of fetal growth
restriction cases and 36% of preterm deliveries are attributable to malaria in pregnancy. In placental
malaria, P. falciparum-infected red blood cells accumulate in the maternal intervillous spaces of the
placenta. It is believed that the inflammatory response to infection underlies the mechanisms by which
placental malaria leads to fetal growth restriction; however, the consequences of the differential
inflammatory signatures in remain unexplored. Dr. Valderramos’ recent work has shown that maternal and
fetal macrophages have distinct gene responses to placental malaria. These differences correlate with birth
weight, and depend on the mother’s pregnancy history, suggesting a new explanation for the increased
susceptibility to pregnancy complications seen in first-time mothers. She will test the hypothesis that the
type I interferon pathway plays an important role regulating the balance between inflammation and
immunity in placental malaria, and that more severe dysregulation of this inflammatory response may have
a greater negative impact on placental development and pregnancy outcome. Specifically, she will 1) apply
a combination of laser capture microdissection and RNAseq approaches to placental biopsies (malaria
cases vs. controls) she collected in Uganda, which will enable global transcriptional profiling of immune and
other responses of individual placental cell types; and 2) test the effects of differentially expressed
molecules that could impact placental development using in vitro models of this process. These studies will
identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. Through a focused program of mentored training and
coursework, the she will develop advanced skills in placental biology, bioinformatic analysis, translational
immunology, and the design and conduct of translational studies of malaria in resource-limited settings. At
the completion of this award, Dr. Valderramos will be well positioned to develop an R01 application to
further define correlates and mechanisms of pathologic inflammatory responses to placental malaria.","189986",

Generally
speaking, metastasis is incurable and results in a median survival of only 1.5 to 3 years for patients with
metastatic disease. In fact, treatment goals for women with metastatic disease no longer aim to produce a
cure, but instead focus on symptom management and prolonging the length and quality of life for these
patients. A major barrier to eradicating BC reflects the paucity of knowledge related to how metastatic latency
is initiated, maintained, and overcome, and to how these metastatic “time bombs” can be defused in BC
patients. Information derived from our highly innovative and medically relevant studies will (i) provide valuable
information on how disseminated BC cells undergo and eventually emerge from latency, as well as on how the
novel long noncoding RNA, BORG, drives the long-term survival and reactivation of proliferation programs in
metastatic BC cells; and (ii) map the epigenomic landscape and its reprogramming as disseminated BC cells

molecular mechanisms that govern this event remains incomplete. Interestingly, many BCs disseminate long
before their primary tumors become symptomatic. In fact, ~50% of women diagnosed with small tumors of the
breast (4 mm) already harbor disseminated carcinoma cells in their bone marrow. Moreover, these
micrometastases escape clinical detection by remaining latent for years before reemerging as incurable
secondary tumors that are insensitive to chemotherapies that were originally effective against the primary tumor.
A major barrier to eradicating BC reflects the paucity of knowledge related to how mammary tumors acquire
metastatic and recurrent phenotypes, which underlies the inability of science and medicine to detect and treat
latent micrometastases. These knowledge deficits are especially problematic for triple-negative breast cancers
(TNBCs), which are highly aggressive and prone to rapid relapse; they also lack FDA-approved targeted
therapies necessary to improve their dismal overall survival rates. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have
recently emerged as powerful global regulators of chromatin remodeling and gene expression in diverse
physiological settings, including cell and tissue homeostasis, embryogenesis and development. Moreover, an
ever expanding array of scientific evidence related to the pathophysiology of lncRNAs in human disease led us
to postulate that developing and progressing TNBCs hijack the global chromatin reprogramming ability of
lncRNAs, thereby eliciting emergence from metastatic latency and initiating lethal disease recurrence.
Accordingly, we identified BORG (BMP/OP-Responsive Gene (BORG), as a powerful oncogenic lncRNA whose
aberrant expression correlated with the acquisition of EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and metastatic
phenotypes in (a) human and murine TNBCs cells; (b) human breast tumors and their corresponding CNS
metastases; and (c) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of human BC as compared to normal breast
epithelial cells. Additionally, BORG is sufficient in driving latent disseminated TNBCs cells to reactivate
proliferative programs both in vitro and in vivo, events associated with epigenomic reprogramming operant in
repressing cellular senescence programs, and in activating cell survival programs. Based on these and other
preliminary findings, we hypothesize that BORG drives TNBC metastasis and recurrence by (i) remodeling the
epigenome to reactivate proliferative programs that circumvent quiescence- and senescence-associated
transcriptomes, and (ii) promoting the induction of survival signaling systems coupled to the acquisition of
chemoresistant phenotypes. These hypotheses will be addressed by two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine
the mechanisms whereby BORG:TRIM28 complexes form and drive TNBC metastasis and recurrence. We will
identify the minimal BORG determinants necessary to bind TRIM28, as well as the domains in TRIM28 that bind
BORG. Additionally, we will map the chromatin alterations provoked by BORG by performing TRIM28 and
H3K4me1 ChIP-seq analyses in BORG-proficient and -deficient TNBCs, findings that will be validated in human
breast cancer specimens. Aim 2 will determine the mechanisms whereby BORG:RPA1 complexes and NF-kB
promote TNBC survival and chemoresistance. Similar to Aim 1, we will identify the minimal BORG sequences
necessary to bind RPA1, and conversely, the regions in RPA1 that interact with BORG. The impact of preventing
BORG:RPA1 complex formation on TNBC survival and chemoresistance will be determined, as will the role of
ATM in regulating the interplay between TRIM28 and RPA1 when bound to BORG. Finally, the impact of these
events in mediating TNBC resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy will be assessed in vitro, and in preclinical
therapy trials. Collectively, the findings obtained in this innovative application will provide novel molecular insights
into how BORG drives TNBC to acquire metastatic, recurrent, and chemoresistant phenotypes.","410791",

effects on many US veterans. An estimated 44 million Americans, or 55 percent of the people
50 years of age and older, are currently at risk for osteoporotic fracture. Improved treatment
options for the disease require a greater understanding of the cellular events and signaling
pathways that control bone metabolism. The proposed research capitalizes on a recently
identified secreted inhibitor of Wnt glycoproteins. The long-term goal of the proposed project is
to investigate whether targeting a new, secreted inhibitor of Wnt signaling—Notum--can improve
bone properties and reduce fracture susceptibility. In the first aim we propose to determine the
cell type in which Notum inhibition exerts its effects on bone homeostasis, by crossing
conditional Notum mutant mice to different Cre drivers that are active during different stages of
the mesenchymal cell lineage. We will also look the gene expression changes induced by
Notum inhibition to see if the canonical Wnt pathway, the noncanonical Wnt pathway, the
Hedgehog pathway, or some other pathway, is primarily affected. We will also identify
downstream nodes in the pathways altered by Notum inhibition, to see if there are more readily
targetable effectors of the HBM phenotype induced by Notum inhibition. I the second aim, we
will conduct functional studies targeting Notum, which has direct applicability to future
therapeutic approaches in patients. Glucocorticoids are widely used among the veteran
population for numerous conditions, including organ transplant, rheumatoid arthritis,
inflammatory bowel disease, and others, but side effects are not trivial, and bone wasting is a
major concern among glucocorticoid-treated patients. Likewise, mechanical disuse is a major
problem among veterans, which results from long term bedrest, paralysis, and other
complications. We will inhibit Notum in these preclinical models to determine whether Notum
inhibition represents a viable strategy for preserving bone mass and function during two relevant
bone wasting conditions. In this renewal Merit application, we address these questions in order
to identify new ways to improve bone health among the veteran population, and among the
public in general."," ",

Further,
melanoma is a significant problem in Veterans, and it is among the five most frequently diagnosed cancers
among VA cancer patients. Malignant melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, and the existing
therapeutics, including recently approved BRAF inhibitors, have not been fully effective in melanoma
management due to acquired resistance. Therefore, novel target-based approaches are needed for the
management of this neoplasm. We have an ongoing research program to define the role of sirtuins in
melanoma. The mammalian sirtuins constitute a family of seven members (SIRT1 – SIRT7), which play critical
roles in important cellular processes, and are involved in a variety of diseases, including cancer. The role of
SIRTs in cancer is complex, and they appear to have dichotomous functions depending on cell context. Recent
studies have implicated sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a predominantly nuclear protein, in regulating pathways involved in
gene transcription, glucose homeostasis, DNA repair and telomere integrity. SIRT6 has been found to
suppress tumorigenesis in the intestine and liver. However, SIRT6 also has a pro-proliferative role in skin and
prostate cancer, suggesting that its function may be tissue- and context- dependent. Interestingly, SIRT6 has
also been shown to modulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promote metastasis in certain
cancer types. In a recent study, we have demonstrated that SIRT6 is overexpressed in human melanoma cells
and tissues, and SIRT6 inhibition via shRNA-mediated RNA interference resulted in a marked antiproliferative
response (growth inhibition, cell cycle alternation, inhibition of cell migration, senescence and autophagy
dysregulation) in melanoma cells. Our preliminary data and published study together with other published
research provide a strong scientific premise to our investigation into the role and potential therapeutic
significance of SIRT6 in melanoma and supports our proposed hypothesis that SIRT6 plays a critical role in
melanocytic transformation and melanoma progression and together with other driver pathways, can be
therapeutically exploited for melanoma management. The following specific aims are proposed: 1) To define
the role of SIRT6 in melanoma development and progression and its association with critical melanoma driver
pathways employing a tissue microarray (TMA) created from retrospective melanoma tissues from Veteran
patients. In this aim, we will determine the role of SIRT6 in melanoma as well as its association with critical
melanoma driver pathways (RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK-, and p16/cyclin D-CDK4/6-RB- pathways); 2) To determine
the functional and mechanistic significance of SIRT6 in melanoma. In this aim, we will determine the effect of
CRISPR/Cas9 mediated SIRT6 deletion on growth and progression of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo; and
3) To determine the therapeutic significance of SIRT6 inhibition alone and in combination with other promising
target-based anti-melanoma modalities in vivo. We will determine the effects of SIRT6 inhibition using small
molecule SIRT6 inhibitor alone and in combination with other clinically relevant melanoma therapies (BRAF
inhibitor, Vemurafenib; and MEK inhibitor, Trametinib) on melanoma development, growth and metastasis in 1)
Braf-Pten mouse model, and 2) patient-derived xenografts (PDX). We expect that our study will define the role,
mechanism, and interactions of SIRT6 in melanoma as well as novel combinations in pre-clinical settings,
which could be useful for future clinical investigations. This may ultimately lead to the development of novel
diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches for melanoma. Hence, our proposed study is relevant and
significant to the health care of Veterans and is in line with the mission of the Department of Veteran Affairs."," ",

this vascular-tropic pattern of growth is associated with poor survival in melanoma patients. The experiments in

Malignant melanoma has an unusually high propensity to metastasize to the brain; among stage IV patients
40-50% will develop clinically detectable intracranial disease, while on autopsy brain metastases can be
detected in over 70% of patients. Additionally, melanoma brain metastases are a marker of poor prognosis and
despite improvements with systemic targeted therapies and immunotherapies, intracranial control still remains
a significant challenge. In the brain microenvironment, melanoma cells are found predominantly in a
perivascular niche where they “co-opt” the vasculature to support their survival and invasion deep into the
cortex. While this vascular co-optive growth pattern has been associated with poor survival in melanoma
metastasis, vascular-mediated mechanisms are poorly understood and represents a unique opportunity to
target the cohesive interactions between melanoma cells and the endothelium to prevent or treat brain
metastases. My preliminary data has uncovered a vascular-mediated induction of transforming growth factor
beta (TGFβ) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) in melanoma cells after contact with
brain endothelial cells. Additionally, this TGFβ-PDGFRβ signaling axis can activate the downstream PI3K/AKT
pathway, which has sustained activation when the tumor suppressor phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN) is
lost. PI3K/AKT activation or loss of PTEN has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of melanoma brain
metastases but has not been explored in the context of vascular-mediated survival or invasion. Thus, in my
proposal I hypothesize that vascular-mediated induction of TGFβ-PDGFRβ signaling in concert with
PTEN loss is important for melanoma cell invasion and survival in the brain microenvironment.
Throughout my proposal, I will generate and utilize isogenic lines with alterations in TGFβ, PDGFRβ, or PTEN
(or combinations of alterations) and will study their effects on migration and apoptosis through a variety of in
vitro co-culture systems, ex vivo brain slice, and in vivo intracranial models. Successful completion of this work
will reveal a novel vascular-derived role for TGFβ, PDGFRβ, and PTEN in melanoma brain metastasis; this will
provide crucial insights and rationale for the development of therapeutics that disrupt cohesive interactions with
the brain endothelium and exploit the survival advantages of the perivascular brain niche. To complete my
goals, I have assembled a team of mentors with diverse but complementary fields of study to support my
proposal. These include Drs. Andrew Dudley (tumor microenvironment/angiogenesis), Craig Slingluff
(melanoma clinician-scientist), Camilo Fadul (brain metastasis clinician), James Mandell (neuropathologist),
Roger Abounader (PTEN biology and brain cancers), David Kashatus (collaborator for the development of
quantitative imaging platform of vessel co-option in the brain), and Hui Zong (advanced imaging and rodent

pathologies. Our understanding of surfactant metabolism in adult pulmonary disease is very limited and this
restricts the potential for therapeutic targeting. In this project, we have generated a new genetic model of
surfactant insufficiency in adult disease by deleting the low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1)
specifically in surfactant producing type 2 cells (AEC2). LRP1 functions as lipoprotein receptor and extracellular
protease clearing receptor and it is associated with decreased respiratory function in patients with COPD and
pulmonary arterial hypertension. Studies in our generated cell line of LRP1 knockdown AEC2 (LRP1 KD) and
tamoxifen-inducible AEC2-specific LRP1 knockout mice (SPC-LRP1-/-) show that LRP1 is required to maintain
surfactant lipid secretion and intracellular lipid homeostasis to ensure optimal pulmonary compliance and
respiratory function. We hypothesize that LRP1 controls surfactant metabolism in AEC2 and we will study the
regulatory mechanisms. In Aim 1 we will decipher the mechanism of action of LRP1 at the membrane level in
AEC2 and its regulation of the lipid source for surfactant synthesis in AEC2. In Aim 2 we will investigate the
epithelial to mesenchymal cross talk and the role of LRP1 in the progressive decline in lung function during
profibrotic challenges and molecular mechanisms responsible. We will attempt a new therapeutic approach to
stop the decline.
 This proposal is innovative conceptually and technically. The role of AEC2 lipid metabolism during adult
pulmonary disease is unknown. LRP1 regulates many cellular functions through lipid metabolism in different
tissues and our study shows that it also regulates pulmonary function through surfactant lipid metabolism. In
addition, we use novel techniques that include inducible and cell-specific genetic knockout models in vivo lipid
tracing and -omics analysis. Surfactant homeostasis enables basic pulmonary function, but the regulation of
surfactant homeostasis in adult disease is very little understood. The significance of this research is further
underscored by the fact that surfactant lipid is altered in multiple pulmonary pathologies, including the most

Kawasaki disease (KD), the most common cause of pediatric acquired heart disease, is a systemic
vasculitis of unknown etiology that results in coronary artery dilation and aneurysm formation in 25% of
children despite timely administration of currently approved therapies. To address an unmet clinical
need, three investigative teams will join forces to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying
disrupted endothelial cell homeostasis and induction of an innate immune response using cultured
cells and mouse models. A pilot study of two therapies designed to block these pathways (anakinra
and atorvastatin) will be conducted in acute KD patients to test the hypothesis that the induction of an
innate immune response and endothelial cell dysfunction can be attenuated with the combined
therapies.","NHLBI","10311990","11/19/2021 12:00:00 AM","PA-16-160","5R01HL140898-05","5","R01","HL","140898","05"," ","BURNS, KRISTIN","1/1/2018 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2022 12:00:00 AM","Atherosclerosis and Inflammation of the Cardiovascular System Study Section[AICS]"," ","7989301","BURNS, JANE C","HOFFMAN, HAROLD M; SHYY, JOHN YJ; TREMOULET, ADRIANA H","52","PEDIATRICS","804355790","UYTTZT6G9DT1","804355790","UYTTZT6G9DT1","US","32.881785","-117.236973","577507","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO","LA JOLLA","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","920930621","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2021 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2022 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2022"," "," ","NHLBI","423343","232838"," ","More than 25% of children with Kawasaki disease (KD), the most common cause of pediatric acquired heart
disease, develop coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs) despite standard therapy with intravenous
immunoglobulin. Once aneurysms have formed, the damage to the arterial wall is irreversible, such as stenoses
and calcification that may lead to ischemic complications. This collaborative team has established that activation
of the IL-1 pathway and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) with downregulation of krüppel-like
factor 4 (KLF4) are key to the pathogenesis of KD vasculitis. Our novel discovery of the central role of TIFA (TNF
receptor-associated factor-interacting protein with a forkhead-associated domain) in NLRP3 inflammasome
activation in endothelial cell (EC) injury is proposed as a further mechanism of KD vasculitis. We propose a bold
plan to unite this research team with expertise in vascular biology, immunology, and clinical KD to unravel the
mechanisms underlying vascular injury in KD and pilot a novel therapeutic approach. The guiding hypothesis
is that acute KD not only activates the IL-1/TIFA/NLRP3 inflammasome in the endothelium, but also reduces EC
homeostasis, both of which are critical in the pathogenesis of KD. The blockade of the IL-1-dependent innate
immune response by anakinra (recombinant IL-1R antagonist) in combination with the restoration of EC function
by atorvastatin will reduce vascular damage in acute KD. Three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis.
Specific Aim 1 will delineate the molecular basis by which anakinra blocks activation of the innate immune
response associated with KD vasculitis. In vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments will investigate the role of IL-1,
TIFA, and NLRP3 in KD-mediated EC dysfunction and vasculitis using pathway-specific siRNA knockdown,
recombinant overexpression, pharmacologic agonists and inhibitors (including anakinra), as well as loss-of-
function mice. Specific Aim 2 will elucidate the molecular basis by which atorvastatin restores EC function in
acute KD. Mouse lines with gain- and loss-of-function of KLF4 as well as lineage tracing experiments will be
performed to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying EC dysfunction in KD vasculopathy. Specific Aim
3 will determine the synergistic effect of anakinra/atorvastatin combination therapy in LCWE-injected mice and
in KD patients. LCWE mouse models, including Tifa-/- and Klf4-/-, will be utilized to test the effect of
anakinra/atorvastatin combination therapy on vascular inflammation and EC function. Furthermore, acute KD
patients with early CAAs will be enrolled in a pilot study of anakinra/atorvastatin combination therapy. Cytokine
levels and MMP activity in sera and transcript abundance in whole blood RNA will be measured pre- and post-
treatment. These sera will also be tested in vitro with cultured ECs with read-outs for EC innate immune
responses and EC dysfunction. The synergistic expertise of the three teams in this multi-PI proposal provides a
unique opportunity to understand molecular mechanisms underlying KD vasculopathy and rapidly translate the
findings into a pilot study in children with in vitro and in vivo assessments of the treatment effect.","656181",

There is significant potential to decrease ovarian cancer incidence through prevention. Oral contraceptives
(OCs) confer a 30-50% reduced risk of developing epithelial ovarian cancer, suggesting that an effective
preventive approach using hormones is possible. Progestin-potent OCs confer twice the ovarian cancer
protection as newer weak-progestin OCs. These data suggest that a progestin-based pharmacologic strategy
may be highly effective for prevention of ovarian cancer. Progestin potency can be enhanced through
combination with vitamin D, a second preventive agent that is also non-toxic when administered as
cholecalciferol; therefore, the two agents may act synergistically on chemopreventive endpoints in the
gynecologic tract such that progestins positively influence vitamin D metabolism. The tissue of origin of ovarian
cancer remains uncertain. There is now compelling evidence that the origin of many high grade ovarian
cancers may be the fallopian tube, thus creating an opportunity for identifying molecular targets in the fallopian
tube for effective ovarian cancer prevention. The proposed research is designed to determine the molecular
mechanisms by which ovarian cancer, whether it originates from the ovary or the fallopian tube, may be
prevented. Prevention of fallopian tube/ovarian cancer using a combination of vitamin D and each of the three
classes of progestins will be tested in the following three aims. First, the impact of these treatments on
molecular pathways that lead to cell death in fallopian tube and ovarian epithelial cells will be investigated.
This will include extension of the active life of vitamin D by inhibition of CYP24A1, as well as increased
sensitivity of these cells to vitamin D by enhanced production of the vitamin D receptor. Secondly, the
interaction between the progesterone receptor and progesterone response elements PRE(s) will be
mechanistically defined in the CYP24A1 promoter through the use of CYP24A1 promoter-luciferase reporter
constructs. Endogenous functional PRE(s) in ovarian cancer cell lines will be selectively inactivated using
CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. The resulting stable cell line(s) harboring non-functional PRE(s) in
the CYP24A1 promoter will then be used to validate loss of synergy between progesterone and vitamin D in
vitro as well as in vivo in mouse xenografts. Thirdly, in vivo experiments using two genetically modified mouse
strains that develop fallopian tube cancer closely resembling human ovarian cancer will be performed to
determine the in vivo impact of progestins and vitamin D on fallopian tube epithelial cancer development.
Understanding the mechanisms by which progestins are integrally involved in each of these processes, will
facilitate development of a robust pharmacologic approach to prevent ovarian/fallopian tube cancer. The goal
of this research is to identify an optimal pharmacologic strategy combining progestins and vitamin D for an
effective ovarian cancer chemopreventive approach that can be tested in women at risk of developing ovarian
cancer.","321432",

 There are an estimated 12,390 cases of glioblastoma (GBM) in the United States with a median survival rate
of only 14.6 months despite advances in surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The microenvironment
of these tumors is often highly infiltrated with immunosuppressive cells, including tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs). Checkpoint blockade therapies rely on the infiltration of tumors with cytotoxic T cells to be effective, and
therefore some GBM patients may not respond well to them. Therefore, GBM has been an attractive target for
treatment with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy to overcome immune evasion often observed in
GBM patients by producing T cells that respond to the GBM tumor neo-antigen epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) variant III (EGVRvIII). Despite some advances in response, the microenvironment can play an important
role in modulating the response of tumors to immune modulatory therapies. GBM patients that do not respond
to checkpoint blockade therapy often have high levels of TAM infiltration, which might limit the efficacy of CAR
T therapy. Previous work has shown that tumor derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can modulate the
microenvironment toward a pro-tumor, immune inhibitory environment. Specifically, they can be taken up by
macrophages to drive them toward a pro-tumor, immune-suppressive phenotype. Numerous studies have
outlined the ability of exosomes to directly bind T cells and block cytotoxic activity against tumors. A blood-based
‘liquid biopsy’ is ideal to determine which patients will respond to immunotherapy without the need for invasive
biopsies. I therefore hypothesize that tumor derived EVs transmit cargo to the immune system regulating
therapeutic response to immunotherapy and this cargo can serve as prognostic biomarkers.
 In the first aim, I will determine the impact of tumor EV secretion on immune infiltrate and immunotherapy
efficacy by reducing EV secretion using Rab27a KO. These models will be tested in both humanized mice as
well as syngeneic models to test the impact of EV secretion of CAR T cell efficacy and checkpoint blockade
therapy (respectively). In the second aim I will use novel microfluidics to capture tumor EVs, measure mRNAs,
test if any of these differentially expressed mRNAs are prognostic or predictive biomarkers. I will additionally
compare these markers to immune infiltrate in the same patients using multispectral imaging.
 My proposal focuses on one major question: How EVs regulate the immune system and the tumor response
to immunotherapy. Insights into EV mRNA cargo, will both identify patients that will respond to immunotherapy
as well as help identify alternative treatments to overcome an immunosuppressive environment.","70458",

 Gemcitabine (GEM), a frontline drug, shows limited efficacy due to its rapid metabolism and inefficient delivery
to the desmoplastic pancreatic tumor site. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling activates pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs)
and plays a critical role in the formation of desmoplasia and proliferation of cancer stem cells (CSCs). KRAS is
predominantly mutated in pancreatic cancer (PC), yet KRAS remains a difficult target. Since inhibition of
mTORC1/2 increases ERK phosphorylation, we propose combination therapy of GEM with ONC201, which is
an AKT/ERK dual inhibitor to effectively treat PC. ONC201 inhibits cell proliferation and induces TNF-related
apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis. Further, we have adopted a stroma depletion strategy
by sequentially administrating Hh inhibitor MDB5 for reducing physical barrier of drug delivery to the tumor site.
While sonic hedgehog (Shh)-deficient tumors have reduced stromal content, such tumors are aggressive with
increased vascularity and metastatic potential. Therefore, reduction of desmoplasia by inhibiting Hh pathway will
allow efficient delivery of ONC201 and GEM loaded into EGFR targeted NPs to the pancreatic tumor site. We
have identified an effective combinatorial treatment strategy using clinically viable inhibitors, which can be
applied to PDAC tumors with different KRAS mutations. In our preliminary studies, (i) compared to free GEM,
mPEG-co-PCC-g-GEM-g-DC NPs increased GEM accumulation in orthotopic tumor by 2.5-fold. To control GEM
release into the tumor, we synthesized mPEG-co-P(Asp)-g-DC-S-S-GEM with GEM payload of 14% w/w. There
was 90% GEM release from the polymer upon incubation with L-glutathione (GSH). Combination of GEM with
ONC201 showed synergy in killing resistant PC cells in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo more effectively
than their monotherapies. We also synthesized 2-chloro-N1-[4-chloro-3-(2-pyridinyl) phenyl]-N4, N4-bis(2-
pyridinylmethyl)-1,4-benzenedicarboxamide (MDB5), which inhibited Hh ligands and CSC markers more
efficiently than vismodegib. Targeted NPs were prepared and optimized by decorating their surface with EGFR
binding peptide GE11 at different ligand density. Systemic administration of MDB5 loaded GE11-NPs into PC
tumor bearing mice resulted in higher drug concentration in the tumor at 4h post administration compared to
non-targeted NPs. Therefore, we hypothesize that sequential administration of MDB5 loaded NPs will increase
GEM and ONC201 delivery to the tumor and result in synergistic inhibition of PC by reversing resistance induced
by desmoplasia and CSC proliferation more efficiently. Our specific aims are to i) assess the effects of ONC201
and GEM combination in GEM resistant PC cells in vitro and in vivo, ii) development of targeted redox sensitive
nanomedicine of MDB5, ONC201 and GEM, and iii) nanoparticulate delivery of MDB5, ONC201, and GEM
combination in orthotopic, PDX and spontaneous KPC mouse models. Long-term impact is to develop novel
strategies to reduce desmoplasia-induced chemoresistance in PC using multifunctional nanomedicine of MDB5,
GEM and ONC201.","454747",

morbidity, high mortality and limited treatment options. The main subsite of HNSCC is the oral cavity, where the
disease presents primarily as tobacco- and alcohol-associated HPV(-) oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
Despite great progress in the understanding of genomic alterations in OSCC, the molecular details underlying
the progression of non-invasive oral lesions to advanced disease with lymph node metastasis remain poorly
understood. To gain insights into the mechanisms that contribute to OSCC progression to metastasis we have
studied the interaction between nuclear β-catenin and cAMP-response element-binding (CREB)-binding protein
(CBP) in OSCC by applying our newly developed computational methodologies coupled with genomic,
epigenetic, molecular, biochemical and functional analyses. Our published and preliminary studies show that
inhibition of β-catenin/CBP activity with small molecule antagonists, ICG-001 and E7386, in a panel of OSCC
cell lines inhibits cell proliferation and mesenchymal phenotype while inducing cellular differentiation. Similarly,
inhibition of β-catenin/CBP signaling in human OSCC cell line-derived tumor xenografts in nude mice inhibits
tumor growth and metastasis and abrogates rapid metastases driven by subpopulations of OSCC stem cell-like
cells, or cancer stem cells (CSCs), in embryonic zebrafish. Our recent global chromatin immunoprecipitation
followed by sequencing (ChIPseq) studies show that β-catenin/CBP collaborates with the histone
methyltransferase, MLL1, to promote global H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at transcription start sites (TSS) of
numerous CSC genes. This finding is supported by our recent genomic analyses based on RNAseq and
scRNAseq data showing that β-catenin/CBP activity is associated with aggressive cell states, including CSCs.
Preliminary analyses also suggest that β-catenin/CBP complexes include the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and
TAZ (YAP/TAZ), which, like β-catenin, are associated with resistance to both chemotherapy and cetuximab in
HNSCC (19,20). Using well characterized OSCC cell lines, we integrated gene expression signatures associated
with the inhibition of the β-catenin/CBP axis with OSCC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to show
that β-catenin/CBP activity is associated with progressive disease and reduced patient survival. Building on these
collective findings we hypothesize that aberrant activation of β-catenin/CBP signaling underlies the expansion
CSCs during HNSCC progression to metastatic disease and that its antagonism may inhibit advanced disease.
This hypothesis will be tested in two aims that will: 1) define the role of the β-catenin/CBP axis in HNSCC
progression to advanced disease; and 2) determine the molecular mechanisms underlying β-catenin/CBP activity
in the induction of CSC phenotypes. Our studies will generate a dynamic integrated map aligning β-catenin-CBP-
activity with distinct aggressive cell states and their associated in gene signatures, signaling networks and protein
assemblies and provide a rationale for the development of new treatment strategies to combat this malignancy.","581066",
