Project Narrative
NeoStem will conduct research on stem cells and explore their enormous promise to produce breakthrough
therapies and cures. The study will investigate the effect of a marrow population of mesenchymal cells (MSCs)
that are very small and have embryonic-like properties (VSEL cells) that can be utilized for bone regeneration
- and ultimately for the treatment of osteoporosis. This study will test in vivo the capacity of human VSEL cells
to form bone in an animal model and regenerate a critical sized boney defect.","NIAMS","7744588","9/29/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-050","1R43AR056893-01A1","1","R43","AR","056893","01","A","WANG, FEI","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-L(10)B]"," ","8839029","RODGERSON, DENIS OVEREND","TAICHMAN, RUSSELL S","07","Unavailable","042403451","USWTE8MPR7H1","042403451; 079577301","USWTE8MPR7H1","US","40.752515","-73.975378","10012001","CALADRIUS BIOSCIENCES, INC.","BASKING RIDGE","NJ","Domestic For-Profits","079204500","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","701","SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","108746",

Deterioration of cartilage due to trauma or disease, most notably arthritis, affects over 20% of adults
in United States, and the frequency of this pathology is projected to further increase with the aging of
population. Healing of damaged cartilage is extremely inefficient, therefore creating cartilage implants
in vitro has recently been put forward as a promising therapeutic approach. The goal of this study is
to characterize the molecular mechanisms that govern cartilage formation both in vivo and in vitro,
and thus to provide molecular tools for bioengineering of robust and stable cartilage implants.","NIAMS","7644225","9/9/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-06-383","1R03AR057126-01","1","R03","AR","057126","01"," ","TYREE, BERNADETTE","9/9/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","ZAR1-EHB-D(M1)"," ","6061673","NURMINSKAYA, MARIA ","Not Applicable","07","BIOCHEMISTRY","188435911","Z9CRZKD42ZT1","188435911","Z9CRZKD42ZT1","US","39.291412","-76.624753","820104","UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE","BALTIMORE","MD","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","212011508","UNITED STATES","N","9/9/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","75000",

Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Weinberg, Robert A.
Relevance
 Much attention has focused in recent years on the promise of using embryonic stem (ES) cells to
regenerate various adult tissues. We believe, however, that for the foreseeable future, a far more viable and
attainable strategy will derive from experimental protocols designed to induce the reprogramming of
differentiated adult cells into committed progenitors and stem cells. These reprogrammed cells can then serve
as vehicles for the regeneration of adult tissues depleted by aging or by various pathological processes. For
this purpose, we intend to develop a cocktail of signaling agents that can be applied to in vitro cultures of
differentiated epithelial cells in order to reprogram them to committed epithelial stem cells via activation of a
latent developmental program. We believe that this strategy can be applied to many epithelial tissues, such as
the skin or mouth mucosa.

Project Narrative
When corneal endothelial cells die due to injury or disease, they do not divide to replace themselves, resulting
in loss of corneal clarity and visual acuity. Successful completion of these exploratory studies to test whether
human umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells can be differentiated to form corneal endothelial cells
could have a major impact on the treatment of corneal disease by providing a new, healthy source of

The spatial localization and cellular constituents forming the hematopoietic stem cell
(HSC) niche are unclear, with studies suggesting that HSC localizes either near
osteoblasts or the vasculature. Preliminary studies supporting this proposal suggest that
bona fide mesenchymal stem cells, peri-vascular and isolatable by Nestin expression,
form a unique HSC niche in the bone marrow. This proposal explores the function of this
candidate niche cell during the normal development and pathological states of bone
marrow attrition and expansion.","NHLBI","7757961","9/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-09-010","1R01HL097819-01","1","R01","HL","097819","01"," ","THOMAS, JOHN","9/5/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-W(M1)"," ","2085323","FRENETTE, PAUL S","Not Applicable","13","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","078861598","C8H9CNG1VBD9","078861598","C8H9CNG1VBD9","US","40.790525","-73.953788","3839801","ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","100296574","UNITED STATES","N","9/5/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","839","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","423750",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Demand for bioengineered teeth is increasing. However, engineering human dental epithelial cells is a critical
hurdle in addressing this demand. Our goal in this proposal is to differentiate human embryonic stem cells into
dental epithelial cells. We hypothesize that human dental epithelial cells can be generated from pluripotent
human embryonic stem cells if the appropriate niches are provided.","NIDCR","7787838","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-07-418","1R03DE019507-01A1","1","R03","DE","019507","01","A","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","ZDE1-JH(39)"," ","9068972","ZHANG, YAN ","Not Applicable","12","DENTISTRY","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","US","37.78689","-122.448998","577508","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO","SAN FRANCISCO","CA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","941432510","UNITED STATES","N","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","115875",

And, it also initiates a metastatic phenotype in late stage cancers. A set of transcription factors including ZFHX1a regulate epithelial and mesenchymal genes to control normal epithelial vs. mesenchymal balance in vivo, and deregulation of these factors is important for initiation of fibrotic disease and cancer metastasis. Studies proposed here are directed at the molecular mechanism of how ZFHX1a regulates transcription. Such fundamental knowledge should provide a foundation for developing therapeutic approaches aimed at controlling fibrotic disease and cancer metastasis.","NEI","7350756","7/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01EY018603-01","1","R01","EY","018603","01"," ","SHEN, GRACE L","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Intercellular Interactions Study Section[ICI]"," ","1877760","DEAN, DOUGLAS CHASE","Not Applicable","03","OPHTHALMOLOGY","057588857","E1KJM4T54MK6","057588857","E1KJM4T54MK6","US","38.185212","-85.660469","4679701","UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE","LOUISVILLE","KY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","402920001","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NEI"," "," "," ","333000",

Project Narrative
Tissue stroma represents a varied and variable constellation of lineages that play a vital
role in regulating tissue development, physiology and repair. This project seeks to
provide in-depth characterization of heart, lung and bone marrow mesenchymal cells as
critical complements and guiding contributors to tissue specific progenitor cell fate.
Mesenchymal cell subpopulations will be molecularly defined enabling their prospective
isolation and functional characterization as determinants of tissue specific progenitor cell
differentiation, self-renewal and integration into physiologically functioning tissue.","NHLBI","7677802","12/6/2008 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-08-012","1R03HL096372-01","1","R03","HL","096372","01"," ","BUXTON, DENIS B","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-J(F3)"," ","1861205","SCADDEN, DAVID T","Not Applicable","08","Unavailable","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","US","42.347465","-71.082058","4907701","MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021142621","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","44000",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Myostatin is being explored as an attractive target for the discovery of function promoting anabolic therapies for
conditions associated with loss of muscle mass and physical function, such as HIV-associated weight loss and
wasting, and aging. This project aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which myostatin regulates skeletal
muscle and fat mass. We will test the hypothesis that myostatin regulates mesenchymal stem cell
differentiation through activation of the TGF-beta/SMAD pathway and cross-communication of the SMAD
signal to the Wnt/beta-catenin/TCF-4 pathway and thereby modulating myogenic and adipogenic
differentiation.","NIDDK","7621214","3/9/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01DK078512-01A2","1","R01","DK","078512","01","A","HAFT, CAROL R","3/9/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","AIDS Clinical Studies and Epidemiology Study Section[ACE]"," ","8089691","BHASIN, SHALENDER ","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","005492160","JZ8RQC4EMDZ5","005492160","JZ8RQC4EMDZ5","US","42.337865","-71.070685","3617301","BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021182908","UNITED STATES","N","3/9/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2010 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDDK"," "," "," ","531914",

Relevance
 These experiments are meant to develop a new therapeutic paradigm, in which patient-specific pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) are corrected by gene targeting and then returned to the patient. They will establish the
feasibility of correcting genetic mutations in iPSCs and using these cells to generate bone, with major
significance for the treatment of genetic diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta.

The goal of the proposed studies is to investigate in greater depth a mechanism for diabetes-enhanced
periodontal bone loss, uncoupling of bone formation and resorption by diabetes. We will use a new animal
model in which bone loss is initiated by the introduction of A. actinomycetemcomitans. This model has the
advantage of a better defined microbial component compared to the original animal model. In addition, we will
investigate additional mechanisms by which this may occur, the impact of diabetes-enhanced inflammation on
proliferation and differentiation of alveolar mesenchymal/osteoblastic cells in vivo.","NIDCR","7832665","9/18/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R01DE017732-04S1","3","R01","DE","017732","04","S","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","7/1/2007 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-K(95)S]"," ","1898737","GRAVES, DANA T","Not Applicable","10","DENTISTRY","781265475"," ","781265475"," ","US","40.741544","-74.191705","10007917","UNIV OF MED/DENT OF NJ-NJ DENTAL SCHOOL","NEWARK","NJ","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","071032495","UNITED STATES","N","9/18/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","99000",

Werner Syndrome (WS) is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by an early onset of
age-related symptoms. WS patients also experience an increased risk of rare non-epithelial
cancers, especially mesenchymal neoplasms such as sarcomas. WRN, the protein defective in
WS is involved in maintenance of genomic integrity and DNA damage repair. To understand
the function of WRN in DNA damage response, we proposed to (i) determine the mechanism by
which WRN is recruited to the sites of DNA damage in vivo, (ii) find out kinases that are
responsible for WRN phosphorylation and (iii) determine the biological significance of WRN
phosphorylation in the process of DNA double strand break repair mediated through non-
homologous end joining and/or homologous recombination. The results obtained with these
experiments will further elucidate the mechanism by which WRN contributes in genome
maintenance, cancer and DNA repair.","NCI","7652143","1/16/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA134991-01A1","1","R01","CA","134991","01","A","PELROY, RICHARD","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Etiology Study Section[CE]"," ","1857780","CHEN, DAVID J","Not Applicable","30","RADIATION-DIAGNOSTIC/ONCOLOGY","800771545","YZJ6DKPM4W63","800771545","YZJ6DKPM4W63","US","32.814772","-96.841146","578404","UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER","DALLAS","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","753909105","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","325775",

differentiation, and survival will likely lead to more effective theapies to selectively promote bone formation.","NIA","7650703"," "," ","2P01AG004875-26","2","P01","AG","004875","26"," "," ","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZAG1-ZIJ-8(J2)","8375","3131924","OURSLER, MERRY JO","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","US","44.022374","-92.465881","4976101","MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER","ROCHESTER","MN","Other Domestic Non-Profits","559050001","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM"," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009","274593","274593"," "," "," "," "," ",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The inner ear contains complex and sensitive structures, which present a significant challenge for therapeutic
interventions. We propose to advance the feasibility of a novel method using patient-derived stem cells to
deliver therapeutic agents to the inner ear, with the long-term goal of benefitting a large proportion of patients
suffering from profound sensorineural hearing loss.","NIDCD","7831780","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-003","1RC1DC010706-01","1","RC1","DC","010706","01"," ","FREEMAN, NANCY","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BST-M(58)]"," ","8236411","HASHINO, ERI ","Not Applicable","07","OTOLARYNGOLOGY","603007902","SHHBRBAPSM35","603007902","SHHBRBAPSM35","US","39.780714","-86.174977","577806","INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS","INDIANAPOLIS","IN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","462022915","UNITED STATES","N","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCD"," "," "," ","415433",

Craniofacial malformations resulting from genetic alterations and/or environmental insults are among
the most common forms of human birth defects. Accordingly, understanding the underlying molecular
mechanisms of epithelial signaling is of paramount importance in understanding facial morphogenesis
and pathogenesis. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to identify epithelial signals that regulate
facial morphogenesis and ultimately to establish molecular targets of therapeutics for craniofacial
anomalies.","NIDCR","7698426","5/12/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01DE019823-01","1","R01","DE","019823","01"," ","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","5/13/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","2563587","LI, XUE SEAN","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","US","42.340629","-71.094923","1504801","BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021155724","UNITED STATES","N","5/13/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","425417",

The goal of this project is to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of adult
hepatic progenitor cells (AHPC); to identify factors and signaling molecules that participate in
AHPC growth regulation; to determine the nature of the supporting cells in the AHPC
compartment, the mesenchymal Thy-1 cells, to establish a long-term propagable culture of
AHPC, capable of reconstituting the injured liver and to establish conditions for somatic cell and
gene therapy in animal models.","NIDDK","7843044","5/14/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R56DK059321-06A2","2","R56","DK","059321","06","A","SERRANO, JOSE","4/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Gastrointestinal Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section[GCMB]"," ","6617620","DABEVA, MARIANA D","Not Applicable","14","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","110521739"," ","110521739"," ","US","40.851026","-73.844361","9433501","ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","BRONX","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","104611900","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","OD"," "," "," ","484562",

Project Narrative
A fundamental question in cellular and developmental biology is how a stem cell niche develops, and how
these niches support and maintain stem cell activity. We have pioneered the use of an in vivo model that we
will now use to functionally characterize our prospectively isolated MSCs. Our projects are designed to
understand the nature of these MSCs and how their microenvironment, including interactions with
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), influences their biologic activity. The overall hypothesis driving our project is
that a true mesenchymal stem cell exists within the bone marrow and the activity of this stem cell - including
interactions with hematopoietic stem cells - is dependent on its niche compartment.

Project Narrative
 The project is aimed at developing novel 3D biodegradable porous polymer
scaffolds with biomimetic extracellular matrix (ECM) coating for tissue engineering
application. In this SBIR Phase I work, we will demonstrate the scaffold manufacturing
feasibility by using a proprietary fabrication technique to produce porous 3D tissue
scaffold with controlled porosity and internal architecture, and then use a cell culture
technique to generate an extracellular matrix (ECM) as biomimetic coating. We believe
that this novel manufacturing process will produce scaffolds with desired both
biophysical properties and biological performance.","NCRR","7611274","7/27/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-013","1R43RR028022-01","1","R43","RR","028022","01"," ","BECK, LAWRENCE A","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-SBTS-E(10)B]"," ","9366874","LIU, QING ","Not Applicable","12","Unavailable","808494939"," ","808494939"," ","US","40.439593","-74.487278","10018026","3D BIOTEK, LLC","NORTH BRUNSWICK","NJ","Domestic For-Profits","089023378","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","389","SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCRR"," "," "," ","99902",

7. Project Narrative
Tooth loss is a major health problem in the USA, experienced by up to 42% of the population in some states
and disproportionately affecting minority and economically disadvantaged communities. Dental implants are
the current state-of-the-art treatment for missing teeth, but are prone to mechanical failure and infections, and
are difficult to use in individuals with significant bone loss. The aim of this proposal is to develop methods for
reactivating embryonic dental signaling pathways in adult oral cells for regeneration of natural teeth and their
associated support tissues, including bone, blood vessels, nerves and periodontal ligament, providing
improved function, sensitivity, durability and appearance.","NIDCR","7816181","9/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-003","1RC1DE020337-01","1","RC1","DE","020337","01"," ","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","9/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-C(58)R]"," ","6623783","MILLAR, SARAH E.","Not Applicable","03","DERMATOLOGY","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","US","39.952982","-75.192768","6463801","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","191046205","UNITED STATES","N","9/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","433351",

Project Narrative
This project proposes an innovative technology and approach for creating osteochondral constructs for the
repair of damaged articular cartilage and subchondral bone. A combination of developmental biological signals
will be utilized in a novel controlled release system to deliver differential signals to induce human mesenchymal
stem cells into appropriate osteochondral phenotypes. This system will increase the scope of techniques
available to tissue engineers for generating anisotropic tissues with multiple cell types.","NIAMS","7690918","7/27/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","5R21AR056076-02","5","R21","AR","056076","02"," ","WANG, FEI","9/20/2008 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","1864036","MIKOS, ANTONIOS G.","Not Applicable","02","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","050299031","K51LECU1G8N3","050299031","K51LECU1G8N3","US","29.720685","-95.393732","9291001","RICE UNIVERSITY","HOUSTON","TX","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","770051827","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","196911",

Project Narrative ---Relevance.
Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death and debilitation in the US and worldwide. There is currently
tremendous enthusiasm for cell-base therapies for heart disease. However, there is also an urgent need to
generate further fundamental information in order to design safe and effective therapies. In the previous
funding period of this grant we have generated some of this fundamental information. The present application

Project Narrative
Musculoskeletal diseases present a major economic burden to the healthcare system,
and negatively affect the quality of life of people of all ages and economic resources.
Research outlined in this proposal examines the mechanism by which BMP3 exerts a
negative effect on bone formation and on mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. A
better understanding of the influences of BMP3 on the skeleton will allow for the
development of novel treatments for musculoskeletal disorders.","NIAMS","7846421","9/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R01AR050174-06S1","3","R01","AR","050174","06","S","CHEN, FAYE H","9/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/22/2010 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-A(96)S]"," ","1944055","ROSEN, VICKI ","Not Applicable","07","DENTISTRY","047006379","JDLVAVGYJQ21","047006379","JDLVAVGYJQ21","US","42.335814","-71.105033","3212902","HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL","BOSTON","MA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","021201616","UNITED STATES","N","9/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/22/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","384258",

NARRATIVE
 This pilot study may lead to a new strategy that uses thermal treatments to enhance the maturature levels
of osteoblasts (bone cells) and chondrocytes (cartilage cells) differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells. With
increased maturature, differentiated cells are better to perform functions similar to adult cells in tissue
generation for the repair of injured or aged organs. In addition, the award of this pilot proposal will help to
establish long term stem cell research in the Biomedical Engineering (BME) Department at the City College of

PROJECT NARRATIVE:
Tumor growth is reliant on other cells of the body to produce supportive stroma, without stroma a tumor will
stop growing. We have uncovered that a normal stem cell population, called mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)
play a key role in tumor stroma formation, and their recruitment into the tumor. This project relates to the better
understanding of why MSC are recruited to tumors and provides a rationale for potentially targeting stroma as
a method to control or eliminate tumor growth.","NCI","7826261","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-003","1RC1CA146381-01","1","RC1","CA","146381","01"," ","MOHLA, SURESH","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-OBT-A(58)R]"," ","7722857","MARINI, FRANK C","Not Applicable","09","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","OD"," "," "," ","500000",

Project Narrative:
Completion of this proposal will provide insight both to the basic science of understanding corneal stromal
development and to achieving our ultimate goal, which is the ex vivo generation of a functional, biomimetic
artificial cornea from natural components. Given recent advances in biomaterials engineering and stem cell
research (which are combined in this proposal) we expect to ultimately enhance the ability of clinicians to offer
patients with significant morbidity viable alternative treatment options based on engineered tissue.

Malignant gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor, accounting for the majority of cancers in
the adult central nervous system. They are increasing worldwide and carry a poor prognosis with most
patients succumbing to their disease regardless of treatment. We are investigating the role of the cells
responsible for driving long-term tumor growth and resistance to treatment using methods and techniques
commonly used to study normal adult stem cells. The project should unveil the stem cell characteristics of
brain tumor cells and provide insight in how to regulate the behavior of the cancer cells.

Project Narrative.
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease affecting almost exclusively women,
for which lung transplantation is the only proven treatment. In this proposal we will define
the expression characteristics of LAM cells, enabling dissection of its lineage, and define
the genomic alterations that occur in LAM. These studies will provide insight into how
this disease develops, and enable novel treatment approaches to prevent lung
destruction in women with LAM.","NHLBI","7837882","9/18/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-003","1RC1HL100655-01","1","RC1","HL","100655","01"," ","PEAVY, HANNAH H","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CVRS-B(58)R]"," ","1898020","KWIATKOWSKI, DAVID J.","HENSKE, ELIZABETH P","07","Unavailable","030811269","QN6MS4VN7BD1","030811269","QN6MS4VN7BD1","US","42.334978","-71.105987","1080401","BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021156110","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","499988",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Neurulation is defined as a series of morphogenetic movements that result in the formation of
the neural tube, a dorsal hollow nerve cord that constitutes the rudiment of the entire adult
central nervous system. Knowledge of the mechanisms of secondary neurulation are
essential, given the high incidence of human posterior spinal cord malformations. However,
despite decades of research, the cellular and genetic basis for this type of neurulation
remains poorly understood. The goal of this research proposal is to use the various genetic
tools and labeling techniques available in the zebrafish, to investigate the mechanisms
underlying secondary neurulation. These studies will ultimately increase our understanding of
how neurulation is orchestrated and provide a molecular basis for exploring the etiology of
posterior neural tube defects in humans.","NIGMS","7736005","9/18/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01GM085290-01A1","1","R01","GM","085290","01","A","HAYNES, SUSAN R","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Neurogenesis and Cell Fate Study Section[NCF]"," ","9166092","BREWSTER, RACHEL MELISSA","Not Applicable","07","BIOLOGY","061364808","RNKYWXURFRL5","061364808","RNKYWXURFRL5","US","39.300978","-76.610648","820103","UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALT CO CAMPUS","BALTIMORE","MD","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","212500001","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIGMS"," "," "," ","275485",

 Each year, approximately one million Americans suffer myocardial infarctions (MIs) with a
10% in-hospital mortality rate. Cardiac patch repair is a promising treatment option for MI
patients. In this project, we propose to fabricate a viable thick cardiac patch with decellularized
porcine myocardial scaffold and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, via the assistance of a
novel bioreactor that provides coordinated mechanical and electrical stimulations. The
knowledge gained from our study and clinical product that we envision would benefit thousands
of patients who are suffering MIs.","NHLBI","7724825","8/3/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-042","1R15HL097321-01","1","R15","HL","097321","01"," ","LUNDBERG, MARTHA","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Bioengineering, Technology and Surgical Sciences Study Section[BTSS]"," ","9352840","LIAO, JUN ","Not Applicable","03","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","075461814","NTXJM52SHKS7","075461814","NTXJM52SHKS7","US","33.453337","-88.794298","5386501","MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY","MISSISSIPPI STATE","MS","EARTH SCIENCES/RESOURCES","397625227","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","204796",

Relevance
 Metastasis, the ability of cells to leave a tumor site and spread to other sites, is the major cause of
death in cancer. Recent evidence suggests that there is one general mechanism of genetic reprogramming
that is used by all tumors in becoming metastatic. The goal of this grant is to discover a new class of cancer
drugs that will not stop the growth of tumor cells, but instead directly block metastasis, by interfering with this
genetic reprogramming mechanism.","NCI","7745537","6/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-050","1R43CA141815-01","1","R43","CA","141815","01"," ","ANDALIBI, ALI","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-ONC-Z(13)B]"," ","2066334","FELDER, STEPHEN ","Not Applicable","02","Unavailable","071557065"," ","071557065"," ","US","32.156964","-110.877577","4172201","NUVOGEN RESEARCH, LLC","TUCSON","AZ","Domestic For-Profits","857284326","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","395","SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","146030",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Studies will be undertaken to determine whether genetically modified stem cells isolated
from the bone marrow can be used as vehicles for long-term, sustained delivery of
therapeutic agents to eye tissues of people with a variety of retinal diseases. This
approach to therapy will be tested be evaluating the ability of intraocular implantation of
appropriately modified bone marrow stem cells to preserve the retina in animals with
inherited diseases that cause retinal degeneration. The results of these studies will be
relevant to the treatment of diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic
retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa, and many other disorders affecting the retina and other
tissues as well.","NEI","7727533","7/13/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01EY018815-01A2","1","R01","EY","018815","01","A","NEUHOLD, LISA","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","Biology and Diseases of the Posterior Eye Study Section[BDPE]"," ","1876193","KATZ, MARTIN L","Not Applicable","04","OPHTHALMOLOGY","153890272","SZPJL5ZRCLF4","153890272","SZPJL5ZRCLF4","US","38.948088","-92.326734","578002","UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA","COLUMBIA","MO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","652110001","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","867","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NEI"," "," "," ","316278",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Alternative splicing is a fundamentally important process in which the same gene can generate different
proteins that have different functions, and alterations in this process are implicated in numerous diseases,
including cancer. We have identified an essential alternative splicing regulatory protein that is expressed in a
specific cell type, the epithelial cell, and which is required for development of many organs. The loss of
expression of this gene may be one process that contributes to the invasion and metastasis of many cancers.","NIGMS","7729712","6/29/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","9R01GM088809-06A2","9","R01","GM","088809","06","A","HAYNES, SUSAN R","5/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Molecular Pathobiology Study Section[CAMP]"," ","1902860","CARSTENS, RUSS PAUL","Not Applicable","03","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","US","39.952982","-75.192768","6463801","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","191046205","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIGMS"," "," "," ","311708",

Military personnel are at a substantially increased risk of bone fracture, especially those resulting from high- 
energy combat-related trauma. A major complication of fracture repair in such cases is delayed union or non- 
union, meaning that the bone does not heal in a timely manner or does not heal at all. Repair of skeletal bone 
requires the recruitment and proliferation of stem cells with the capacity to differentiate to functional bone cells. 
Our studies demonstrate that the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) is a novel source of stem cells for this repair 
process. Our data also demonstrate an increase in these cells during non-stabilized fracture repair. The goal 
of these studies is to elucidate the contribution of HSCs to fracture healing, identify the human stem cell that 
possess this oste-chondrogenic potential, and exploit this unique source of osteoprogenitor cells to augment 
fracture healing. Methods to enhance and accelerate the fracture healing process based on mobilization of this 
particular osteo-chondrogenic stem cell source would have far-reachingbenefits for military personnel. 
Decreasingthe time to return to complete mobility and range of function would reduce medicalcosts, decrease 
the time for military recruits toenter active duty after injuries incurred in basic training, and accelerate the 
return of professional soldiers to combat. Moreover, augmenting the healing process may enhance quality of 
life by decreasing pain, increasingmobility and preventing the long-termdisability caused by fracture non- 
union.","VA","7684533","3/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-08-002","1I01BX000333-01","1","I01","BX","000333","01"," "," ","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","Surgery[SURG]"," ","7775909","LARUE, AMANDA C.","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","039807318","WRERXDACNQ31","039807318","WRERXDACNQ31","US","32.785074","-79.95378","481111","RALPH H JOHNSON VA MEDICAL CENTER","CHARLESTON","SC","Independent Hospitals","294015703","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

Project Narrative:
This research project will analyze the role of an enzyme complex called telomerase in chronic fibrotic lung
diseases, such as in various interstitial lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This enzyme is
responsible for maintaining the length of telomeres, repeated pieces of DNA at the ends of chromosomes, but
it is unknown why this enzyme is expressed at high levels in diseased lungs. This project will attempt to
clarify the importance of this enzyme in the development of fibrotic lung disease and thus provide new insights
into many of these diseases that currently lack an effective cure or therapy. It is hoped that attainment of
the study's objectives will provide new ideas for effective treatment and management of these diseases.","NHLBI","7646730","3/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01HL077297-05A1","2","R01","HL","077297","05","A","REYNOLDS, HERBERT Y","7/5/2004 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","Lung Injury, Repair, and Remodeling Study Section[LIRR]"," ","1861132","PHAN, SEM H","Not Applicable","12","PATHOLOGY","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","US","42.244005","-83.73915","1506502","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR","ANN ARBOR","MI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","481091276","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2010 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","376985",

Project Narrative
Fracture healing, which is necessary for maintenance of skeletal integrity, typically efficiently occurs, but is
compromised in certain conditions, including aging. This proposal investigates the role of a key gene,
cyclooxygenase-2, and its expression and function during key processes of fracture healing. Insights gained
from this work will enhance the understanding and treatment of fractures in patients with compromised healing,

Relevance to Public Health
Alternative RNA splicing is a central aspect of most normal and disease processes.
Little is known about the factors and pathways that regulate alternative RNA splicing.
We propose to study how alternative splicing of CD44 is regulated by the Ras signaling
pathway. These studies will both increase our knowledge of mechanisms controlling
alternative splicing and as well the factors that control CD44 activity in diseases such as
cancer.","NIGMS","7653797","7/27/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01GM034277-25","2","R01","GM","034277","25"," ","BENDER, MICHAEL T","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Molecular Genetics B Study Section[MGB]"," ","7355826","SHARP, PHILLIP A","Not Applicable","07","MISCELLANEOUS","001425594","E2NYLCDML6V1","001425594","E2NYLCDML6V1","US","42.359476","-71.093853","4911501","MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","CAMBRIDGE","MA","ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS","021421029","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIGMS"," "," "," ","484888",

NARRATIVE
Intervertebral disc degeneration is commonly implicated in low back pain with a very high prevalence in
humans and very low prevalence in animal species that retain notochordal cells into maturity. Basic science
information on notochordal cells is very limited, and the overall hypothesis is that notochordal cells
orchestrate the biology of the intervertebral disc and may be used to prevent disc degeneration and to
promote disc repair. The purpose of the proposed studies is to investigate the functional relevance and
mechanisms of interaction between notochordal cells with nucleus pulposus and anulus fibrosus cells and
also with bone mesenchymal stem cells.","NIAMS","7739966","7/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","1R21AR056037-01A2","1","R21","AR","056037","01","A","TYREE, BERNADETTE","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","1886157","IATRIDIS, JAMES C.","Not Applicable","At-Large","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","066811191","Z94KLERAG5V9","066811191","Z94KLERAG5V9","US","44.478216","-73.200657","8738101","UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE","BURLINGTON","VT","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","054051704","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","197494",

Narrative for Rubin grant:
The role of exercise to generate a functionally sufficient skeleton involves control of the
differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells along the osteoblast lineage. The signaling cascades
initiated by mechanical stimulation of bone cells confer a cellular phenotype that is both anti-
catabolic and pro-anabolic. Work proposed here seeks to understand the loading induced signals
and responses that result in this phenotype, thereby bringing novel insights into the mechanisms
by which the loaded response is generated.","NIAMS","7582741","5/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01AR042360-13A2","2","R01","AR","042360","13","A","SHARROCK, WILLIAM J","6/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","1897246","RUBIN, JANET E","Not Applicable","04","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","US","35.926939","-79.038605","578206","UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL","CHAPEL HILL","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","275995023","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","299700",

Project Narrative
Adult mesenchymal stem cells hold great promise for treating a multitude of diseases and injuries, 
including limb ischemia associated with diabetes, chronic skin ulcers, and bone fractures.  In this 
proposal, we will examine the therapeutic potential of allogeneic umbilical cord matrix stem cells 
isolated from placental tissue.  We believe that these primitive stem cells, harvested from tissue at birth 
and banked for later therapeutic applications, hold even greater tissue repair and regeneration potential 
than adult derived cells.  Our studies will define the therapeutic potential of these cells and help bring 
novel stem cell therapies to the clinic.

Results from the proposed

HSP90. Aberrations in TGF_ signaling can lead to deregulated cell proliferation or
behavior. HSP90 inhibitors are already under clinical investigation in anticancer
therapy. Since TGF_ is a double-edge sword in tumorigenesis by inhibiting cell
proliferation and promoting metastasis, inhibition of TGF_ functions by HSP90
inhibitors may have both beneficial and side effects. Thus, the proposed studies not
only help to understand the mechanisms of TGF_ and HSP90 interplay in
progression of human cancers, but also offer invaluable information on the careful
use of HSP90 inhibitors for the treatment of human cancer, which will no doubt
reduces cancer mortality.","NIGMS","7581966","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01GM063773-06A2","2","R01","GM","063773","06","A"," ","8/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Molecular Oncogenesis Study Section[MONC]"," ","6486094","FENG, XIN-HUA ","Not Applicable","09","SURGERY","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","US","29.711148","-95.39695","481201","BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","HOUSTON","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","770303411","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIGMS"," "," "," ","337261",

7. Project Narrative
Osteoporosis is disease characterized by progressive bone loss that predisposes bone to fracture.
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in bone marrow are groups of cells that can differentiate into bone
forming cells. However, direct infusions of MSCs failed to yield bone forming response due to the
inability of MSCs migrate to the bone surface. We propose a novel method that can guide the MSCs to
bone surface, which can provide novel treatment options for bone diseases such as osteoporosis and
bone trauma repair.","NIAMS","7708416","7/9/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","1R21AR057515-01","1","R21","AR","057515","01"," ","SHARROCK, WILLIAM J","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","8882248","YAO, WEI ","Not Applicable","03","OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONS","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","US","38.543675","-121.729989","577503","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS","DAVIS","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","956186153","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","240975",

Myocardial infarction (i.e., heart attack) occurs in nearly one million individuals every year and yet there exists no
therapy to recover lost heart function after such an event. Stem cells could provide a basis for effective therapies to
recover lost heart function. We propose to utilize insights gained from stem cell function in healthy tissue and tools
optimized by viruses to advance the utility of stem cells for repair of the heart following an attack.","NHLBI","7841105","8/12/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-407","3R21HL089679-01A2S1","3","R21","HL","089679","01","A2S","ADHIKARI, BISHOW B","8/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","Myocardial Ischemia and Metabolism Study Section[MIM]"," ","7009403","OGLE, BRENDA M","Not Applicable","02","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","161202122","LCLSJAGTNZQ7","161202122","LCLSJAGTNZQ7","US","43.068377","-89.40086","578503","UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON","MADISON","WI","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","537151218","UNITED STATES","N","8/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","204225",

Project Narrative
Obesity and weight gain are associated with diabetes and many other medical problems
including cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Obesity is characterized by an
increase in adipose tissue due to increase in size of existing fat cells, and recruitment of
new progenitors. Wnt signaling is involved in both of these processes; however, the
mechanisms are not well understood. Thus, the proposed research will provide
important insights into adipocyte and whole body metabolism, and potentially provide

Project Narrative
Heart failure is a common condition carrying a high burden of disability and mortality. Current estimates are
that heart failure accounts for approximately one million hospitalizations and
$10 billion in health care costs in the United States per year. The main underlying causes of heart failure are
ischemic heart disease, hypertension and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, whose common pathophysiologic
characteristic is an inadequate mass of functional myocytes. This proposal develops and tests a novel
therapeutic 3D eluting microrod scaffold (MRS) system to deliver a natural cardiac growth factor for aiding in
the regeneration and recovery of damaged cardiac muscle in culture and animal models.","NHLBI","7690669","9/9/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-06-504","1R01HL090523-01A2","1","R01","HL","090523","01","A","LUNDBERG, MARTHA","9/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","ZEB1-OSR-D(M1)S"," ","7579967","GOLDSPINK, PAUL H","Not Applicable","07","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","098987217","W8XEAJDKMXH3","098987217","W8XEAJDKMXH3","US","41.880316","-87.687597","577703","UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO","Chicago","IL","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","606124305","UNITED STATES","N","9/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","405000",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Myocardial infarction (i.e., heart attack) occurs in nearly one million individuals every year and yet there exists no
therapy to recover lost heart function after such an event. Stem cells could provide a basis for effective therapies to
recover lost heart function. We propose to utilize insights gained from stem cell function in healthy tissue and tools
optimized by viruses to advance the utility of stem cells for repair of the heart following an attack.","NHLBI","7659257","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-407","1R21HL089679-01A2","1","R21","HL","089679","01","A","ADHIKARI, BISHOW B","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Myocardial Ischemia and Metabolism Study Section[MIM]"," ","7009403","OGLE, BRENDA M","Not Applicable","02","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","161202122","LCLSJAGTNZQ7","161202122","LCLSJAGTNZQ7","US","43.068377","-89.40086","578503","UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON","MADISON","WI","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","537151218","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","181745",

Project Narrative
Bone grafts are critically needed in surgical procedures to reconstruct skeletal
defects resulting from trauma, chronic diseases, tumor removal and congenital
anomalies. Autologous bone grafts are the clinical gold standard, but necessitate
donor site trauma and morbidity; allogeneic or xenogeneic grafts are associated
with immunorejection, pathogen transmission and suboptimal healing and
synthetic materials such as hydroxyapatite suffer from poor integration. In this
proposal, we have engineered vascularized bone grafts from the combined
actions of vascular progenitor cells and bone progenitor cells; the vascularized
bone grafts can be tailored to any shape and dimension, and integrate with host's
existing bone, thus providing an improved treatment modality for bone defects.","NIDCR","7732025","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-279","1R01DE018248-01A2","1","R01","DE","018248","01","A","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-B(03)M]"," ","1866984","MAO, JEREMY J","Not Applicable","13","DENTISTRY","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","US","40.841253","-73.940404","1833205","COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","100323725","UNITED STATES","N","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","568427",

Project Narrative
 While being responsible for ~90% of cancer related mortality, the process of cancer-cell metastasis
remains poorly understood; many of its steps are now being revealed by studying cell-biological changes that
occur during early embryonic development. These changes also impart to cancer cells an ability to regenerate
themselves, yielding ""cancer stem cells"" that can seed new tumors. The ability to produce large numbers of
such cancer stem cells, as described in the proposed research, may present an opportunity to develop novel
anti-cancer drugs that are able to eliminate tumors by eliminating the stem cells that allow tumors to grow back
after initially successful treatments.","NCI","7583778","12/17/2008 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01CA078461-10A1","2","R01","CA","078461","10","A","MOHLA, SURESH","9/30/1999 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","1891586","WEINBERG, ROBERT A","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","120989983","JVKKKWN2N5N3","120989983","JVKKKWN2N5N3","US","42.363304","-71.087734","1742101","WHITEHEAD INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL RES","CAMBRIDGE","MA","Research Institutes","021421025","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","488456",

Project Narrative
This proposal aims at elucidating the mechanisms involved in the physiological
regeneration of �-cells. Loss of PTEN in the �-cells resulted in a paracrine effect to
induce the proliferative activity in the surrounding mesenchymes and these
mesenchymal cells may support the regeneration of the islets. Identifying how the
communication occurs may provide clinically relevant mechanism for inducing �-cell
regeneration and represents a great leap in regenerative medicine for the treatment of
diabetes","NIMHD","7885231","9/19/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-MD-09-008","1R36MD005009-01","1","R36","MD","005009","01"," ","HUNTER, DELORIS","9/20/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","ZMD1-PA(10)R"," ","10003965","BAYAN, JENNIFER-ANN ","Not Applicable","37","PHARMACOLOGY","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","US","34.065915","-118.196446","7636101","UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA","Los Angeles","CA","SCHOOLS OF PHARMACY","900894304","UNITED STATES","N","9/20/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIMHD"," "," "," ","38854",

Project Narrative
Although approximately 100,000 bone grafts are performed each year to regenerated bone lost due to
trauma or disease that are craniomaxillofacial in nature, the long-term results of these reconstructions
are poor due to the overwhelming tissue fibrosis and scarring that occurs following surgery. This
inflammatory, foreign body response to the grafted biomaterial remains one of the great challenges
in treating patients with birth defects, traumatic injuries or cancers in the head and mouth. Recently,
we have observed remarkable effects of the osteoporosis drug teriparatide (recombinant parathyroid
hormone, PTH) in treating patients with fracture non-unions and animal models of bone grafting, in

propose to formally demonstrate that PTH has these effects and could be used as an adjuvant
therapy during craniomaxillofacial reconstructive surgery.","NIDCR","7727220","6/11/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-DE-09-001","1R01DE019902-01","1","R01","DE","019902","01"," ","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","6/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZDE1-RW(11)"," ","1939533","SCHWARZ, EDWARD M.","GAZIT, DAN ","25","ORTHOPEDICS","041294109","F27KDXZMF9Y8","041294109","F27KDXZMF9Y8","US","43.16888","-77.615939","7047101","UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER","ROCHESTER","NY","SCHOOL OF MEDICINE & DENTISTRY","146270140","UNITED STATES","N","6/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","378001",

Project Narrative:
This project has the potential to demonstrate a viable method for labeling stem
cells and tracking the development of regenerating tissue in vivo and in real time.
It also has a potential to contribute to our understanding of the engineered
osteochondral interface that is of critical value in bioengineered replacement of
arthritic joints.","NIBIB","7691514","9/14/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-06-504","1R01EB009663-01A2","1","R01","EB","009663","01","A","HUNZIKER, ROSEMARIE","9/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","ZEB1-OSR-D(M1)S"," ","1866984","MAO, JEREMY J","Not Applicable","13","DENTISTRY","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","US","40.841253","-73.940404","1833205","COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","100323725","UNITED STATES","N","9/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","286","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIBIB"," "," "," ","553755",

NARRATIVE SUMMARY
Advances derived from this funding cycle have led to advances in our understanding of how
laminins control epithelial mesenchymal interactions during hair development. The proposed
studies in the first Aim will determine the sequence of events which occur in the early events of
hair formation. This proposal also presents preliminary data of a highly promising model of
immunoproliferative skin disease resembling the human disease psoriasis. The studies
proposed in the second Aim will determine the cellular and molecular interactions, as well as the
triggering factors which precipitate epidermal proliferation and immune infiltration in this model.","NIAMS","7730143","6/11/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01AR047223-10A1","2","R01","AR","047223","10","A","BAKER, CARL","8/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section[ACTS]"," ","1885225","MARINKOVICH, MATT PETER","Not Applicable","18","DERMATOLOGY","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","US","37.429038","-122.178178","8046501","STANFORD UNIVERSITY","STANFORD","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","943052004","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","361325",

The potential significance of our application to human health is underscored by
the magnitude of prostate cancer as a health problem, which The American
Cancer Society (ACS) predicts will afflict ~200,000 men and will kill >25,000 in
the US alone. In addition, prostate cancer presents the clinician and the patient
with unique problems in terms of choosing among therapeutic options and
predicting eventual outcomes (see New York Times 26 February article ""A
Review of Prostate Cancer Leaves Men in a Muddle""). The work proposed here
should identify useful markers of tumor behavior and perhaps even targets for
novel therapies.","NCI","7579408","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA127727-01A2","1","R01","CA","127727","01","A","SNYDERWINE, ELIZABETH G","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","1869178","GARCIA-BLANCO, MARIANO A.","Not Applicable","04","GENETICS","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","US","36.006824","-78.924579","2221101","DUKE UNIVERSITY","DURHAM","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","277054673","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","323700",

Project Narrative:
A major focus in biomedical research is to understand how cancer cells invade healthy cells and metastasize
to distant sites. Lung cancer in particular is more prone to aggressive forms of the disease that are difficult to
treat effectively and have a poor clinical prognosis. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common
form of lung cancer. The 5-year mean survival for patients suffering from stage III lung cancer is less than
30%. Poor clinical prognosis for NSCLC is directly associated with late-stage diagnosis and high propensity
for metastasis to liver and bone. For the last several years our laboratory has been working on a transcription
factor called nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-�B). NF-�B is a protein complex that is found in almost all human
cells. In non-cancerous cells NF-�B is tightly regulated, however, cancer cells have found ways to elevate the
activity of NF-�B. Although it is known that cancer cells enhance NF-�B activity, the reasons for this are not
fully understood. Our laboratory has discovered that NF-�B is one of the master-switch transcription factors
required to induce phenotypic changes in cells referred to as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT
is a critical step in cancer metastasis. For the first time, our laboratory can demonstrate that following the
induction of EMT, NF-�B is required to orchestrate changes associated with the induction and maintenance of
cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells are believed to act as a ""seed"" which is able to reestablish malignant
disease. This proposal will identify critical EMT-induced genes that are required for induction and maintenance
of cancer stem cells. The overall goal of this project is use these newly identified gene products as novel
therapeutic targets for detection and treatment of NSCLC.","NCI","7730897","6/5/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01CA104397-06A1","2","R01","CA","104397","06","A","MIETZ, JUDY","4/19/2004 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Molecular Pathobiology Study Section[CAMP]"," ","1889852","MAYO, MARTY W","Not Applicable","05","BIOCHEMISTRY","065391526","JJG6HU8PA4S5","065391526","JJG6HU8PA4S5","US","38.034207","-78.512346","1526402","UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA","CHARLOTTESVILLE","VA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","229044195","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","278392",

Project Narrative
Colorectal cancer is the second most fatal cancer in the United States, largely due to invasion and metastasis
to the liver and lymph nodes. In this proposal, we intend to understand the effects of a novel tumor suppressor,
Pdcd4, on colon tumor metastasis and the molecular mechanism involved in this process. This work will
provide a comprehensive understanding of how Pdcd4 modulates colon tumor progression and holds great
promise for novel interventions for preventing and treating colon cancer.","NCI","7580377","12/18/2008 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA129015-01A2","1","R01","CA","129015","01","A","JHAPPAN, CHAMELLI","1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","8737920","YANG, HSIN-SHENG ","Not Applicable","06","PHARMACOLOGY","939017877","H1HYA8Z1NTM5","939017877","H1HYA8Z1NTM5","US","38.042307","-84.458748","2793601","UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY","LEXINGTON","KY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","405260001","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","303988",

Project Narrative 
 Prostate cancer is the major visceral (non skin) cancer diagnosis (20% of all cancers) 
and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among men. It is the second leading cause 
of cancer mortality among American men. Prostate cancer is especially prominent among 
elderly veterans, with more than 11,000 new cases diagnosed per year in VA hospitals 
(VA Central Office data). Although surgery and radiation therapy are effective in early 
stage prostate cancer, treatment options are limited for patients with metastatic disease 
who become unresponsive to hormonal (androgen deprivation) therapy. The recent 
introduction of Taxotere chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer only prolongs 
survival by 2 to 3 months. 
 In order to develop new approaches to the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, it is 
essential that scientists better understand basic mechanisms leading cancers to spread 
from the prostate gland to other parts of the body (metastasis). Over the past few years, it 
has been recognized that cancer cells in the prostate gland begin to change their shape 
and become more aggressive over time. This change is called, ""epithelial-to- 
mesenchymal transition"", abbreviated as EMT. It is widely recognized that EMT may 
represent an important mechanism leading to metastasis. Hence, it is critical that we 
understand the details of how molecules working inside cancer cells produce EMT and 
metastasis. Once we understand how these molecules lead cancer cells to spread around 
the body, the pharmaceutical industry will be able to develop drugs to counteract these 
molecules and stop cancer metastasis. This approach will open up new avenues for the 
control of metastatic prostate cancer. 
 The goal of this grant application is to identify the molecules involved in cancer EMT 
and to show that interfering with these molecules will stop cancer cells from being able to 
invade surrounding normal tissues and metastasize around the body. We have recently 
published an article demonstrating the discovery of a new pathway by which prostate 
cancer cells become more invasive and capable of metastasis. The current grant will work 
on demonstrating the detailed molecules involved in prostate cancer EMT and begin to 
show that experimental drugs can interfere with this process of cancer dissemination. If 
successful, our research will encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs 
based on the experimental approaches that we hope to develop during this grant. These 
new drugs will be very beneficial to veterans with advanced prostate cancer. 
 This research project will also help to determine which of these ""cancer molecules"" are 
increased in prostate cancer biopsy specimens from patients who will or will not develop 
disseminated cancer in the future. Based on identifying dangerous ""cancer molecules"" in 
a patient prostate biopsy specimen, clinical doctors may be able to say which patients 
need aggressive forms of treatment to prevent metastasis or in the absence of ""cancer 
molecules"", which patients can be managed conservatively by watchful waiting rather 
than surgery (radical prostatectomy) or radiation therapy. 
 The outcome of this research will therefore be very relevance to veterans health and the 
mission of the VA.","VA","7796988","8/7/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-09-001","1I01BX000352-01A1","1","I01","BX","000352","01","A"," ","10/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Oncology A[ONCA]"," ","1978886","ZUCKER, STANLEY ","Not Applicable","03","Unavailable","008209124","ZQZKMKZWMXF3","008209124","ZQZKMKZWMXF3","US","40.89979","-73.306754","481063","NORTHPORT VA MEDICAL CENTER","NORTHPORT","NY","Independent Hospitals","117682200","UNITED STATES","N","10/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

Project Narrative
Prostate cancer is second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in United States, and
thus is an important public health issue. Use of chemopreventive agents seems to be
more effective approach for the control of prostate cancer as it has long latent period of
development; sometimes over decade from precursor lesions to full blown disease.
Current grant proposal focuses on the development of one such agent, namely silibinin,
which is already consumed extensively in the United States and world-wide as a dietary
supplement and used in the clinic as a hepatoprotective agent. This compound has not
shown any toxicity in animal studies as well as in humans. The outcomes of our

Project Narrative
Soft tissue sarcoma is a form of malignancy that occurs anywhere in the body and is
ultimately lethal to approximately 50% of those afflicted, usually secondary to
uncontrollable local or distant tumor recurrence especially in the subset of complex
Karyotype high grade pleomorphic sarcomas. The process of dissemination is not
adequately controlled due to our lack of knowledge of pertinent molecular pathways
driving the proliferation and dissemination of this disease. This research focuses on one
such pathway which appears to be particularly active in soft tissue sarcoma (the AKT
regulation of vimentin expression and function) which may ultimately prove to be
relevant as a potential point of soft tissue sarcoma therapeutic vulnerability.","NCI","7739895","6/16/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA138345-01A1","1","R01","CA","138345","01","A","WOODHOUSE, ELIZABETH","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","8531637","CHELOUCHE LEV, DINA ","Not Applicable","09","BIOLOGY","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","319550",

Cell-based therapies, such as administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), are a promising new
approach to repair the heart after myocardial infarction. Successful implementation of this strategy requires a
greater insight into the mechanism by which MSCs confer therapeutic benefit, which in turn requires an
understanding of the distribution and fate of MSCs after local or systemic delivery. This proposal aims to
develop an ultrasound-based approach for visualizing MSCs that can be used in patients. This new imaging
technology may facilitate the clinical application of MSC therapy, which may ultimately decrease death and
disability from myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure.","NIBIB","7821948","9/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-003","1RC1EB010533-01","1","RC1","EB","010533","01"," ","HUNZIKER, ROSEMARIE","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/29/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-SBIB-V(58)]"," ","2085321","VILLANUEVA, FLORDELIZA S","Not Applicable","18","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","US","40.444001","-79.956102","2059802","UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH","PITTSBURGH","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","152133320","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/29/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","OD"," "," "," ","500000",

Project Narrative
This project will assemble phage-derived target-recognizing proteins, amphiphilic
lipid molecules and therapeutic morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) gene into a
novel spherical carrier that be applied for bone repair and regeneration by gene
therapy. The carrier will have BMP-2 gene protected inside the core and motifs
protruding on the surface that can specifically recognize both bone tissue and
mesenchymal stem cells. Thus the BMP-2 gene can recognize the target bone
tissue and be transferred into MSCs with high specificity and expressed to

So far, the expansion product of the original MSC populations has been analyzed in all clinical trials and by most laboratories, including our own, and although there is certainly utility to those populations, we predict that the majority of the most primitive and effective cells within those cultures have been lost. The overarching goal of our proposed studies is to therefore determine whether there are methods to prospectively isolate MSC in their non-expanded state to provide more effective therapies for improving healthcare, in many different applications. The effects of these therapies on reducing the cost of healthcare will be dramatic.","NHLBI","7653541","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01HL073256-05A1","2","R01","HL","073256","05","A","THOMAS, JOHN","7/20/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Hematopoiesis Study Section[HP]"," ","1861638","NOLTA, JAN A.","Not Applicable","03","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","US","38.543675","-121.729989","577503","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS","DAVIS","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","956186153","UNITED STATES","N","7/20/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","382500",

Project Narrative
Prostate cancer is second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in United States, and
thus is an important public health issue. Use of chemopreventive agents seems to be
more effective approach for the control of prostate cancer as it has long latent period of
development; sometimes over decade from precursor lesions to full blown disease.
Current grant proposal focuses on the development of one such agent, namely silibinin,
which is already consumed extensively in the United States and world-wide as a dietary
supplement and used in the clinic as a hepatoprotective agent. This compound has not
shown any toxicity in animal studies as well as in humans. The outcomes of our
proposed research will provide a mechanism-based agent for the prevention and
therapeutic intervention of prostate cancer in humans.","NCI","7941581","9/29/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R01CA102514-06S1","3","R01","CA","102514","06","S","OGUNBIYI, PETER","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/29/2012 12:00:00 AM","Chemo/Dietary Prevention Study Section[CDP]"," ","1865330","AGARWAL, RAJESH ","Not Applicable","06","PHARMACOLOGY","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","US","39.708143","-104.724958","1199905","UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER","Aurora","CO","SCHOOLS OF PHARMACY","800452570","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/29/2012 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","349606",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Stem cell-based therapies have emerged as a promising approach in regenerative medicine. The ability to
track transplanted stem cells after they are injected into the body is a crucial tool because it will provide insight
into the fate of the injected cells and will help investigators to determine optimal cell delivery methods and
therapeutic doses. In the proposed project, we will evaluate a new approach for labeling stem cells with carbon
nanotubes so they can be tracked by magnetic resonance imaging in a pig model of myocardial infarction.","NIBIB","7828611","9/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-003","1RC1EB010791-01","1","RC1","EB","010791","01"," ","LIU, CHRISTINA","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-SBIB-V(58)]"," ","9856345","PERIN, EMERSON CARVALHO","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","086987831","ET52YPHJ2JR3","086987831","ET52YPHJ2JR3","US","29.798149","-95.369119","951201","TEXAS HEART INSTITUTE","HOUSTON","TX","Research Institutes","772250345","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","OD"," "," "," ","500000",

Project Narrative: Relevance
 Several hundred thousand people suffer sudden cardiac death (SCD) each year in the United
States. Current treatment with implantable cardioverter defibrillators, antiarrhythmic drug therapy, and
radio frequency catheter ablation are ineffective at treating the underlying pathophysiological causes of
SCD. Consequently, SCD remains a major unresolved public health problem. This proposal puts forth
a novel method using targeted cellular therapy to restore normal function and, thus, cure many patients
at risk for SCD.

Large defects from birth, trauma or cancer resection require almost a limitless source of
bone, which cannot be supplied by autogenous donor sites without serious morbidity. A
means of providing large quantities of bone would be to transfer engineered, pluripotent

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), also known as Batten disease, are inherited progressive
neurodegenerative disorders that almost always have a childhood onset and are invariably fatal.
Mutations in at least 8 different genes are known to cause NCL, and no effective therapies have
yet been developed for any of these disorders. Using a unique dog model of one form of NCL,
we plan to conduct pre-clinical research to evaluate promising therapies for these diseases.","NINDS","7739286","4/27/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-08-232","1R21NS064554-01A1","1","R21","NS","064554","01","A","TAGLE, DANILO A","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Neurological Sciences and Disorders B Study Section[NSD-B]"," ","1876193","KATZ, MARTIN L","Not Applicable","04","OPHTHALMOLOGY","153890272","SZPJL5ZRCLF4","153890272","SZPJL5ZRCLF4","US","38.948088","-92.326734","578002","UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA","COLUMBIA","MO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","652110001","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","853","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NINDS"," "," "," ","179945",

Project Narrative: Microfluidic Device for Efficient Gene-Transfection of Adult Stem Cells
 We propose to develop a new device for the electroporation and efficient gene-transfection of
individual mesenchymal adult stem cells (MSCs) for application in spine fusion and other skeletal
regeneration therapies. Adult MSCs are pluripotent cells that represent a promising tool for cell and

 A large database of approximately 1000 archived whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
collected as part of previously funded body composition studies will be analyzed using imaging software to
quantify bone marrow fat in each subject scan. By comparing the relationship between marrow fat and bone
mineral in younger and older subjects, important evidence will be obtained on whether there is a competitive
relationship between marrow fat and bone mineral which will complement molecular level studies.","NIDDK","7739303","6/2/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-151","1R21DK082937-01A1","1","R21","DK","082937","01","A","MALOZOWSKI, SAUL N","6/2/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Clinical and Integrative Diabetes and Obesity Study Section[CIDO]"," ","8249210","SHEN, WEI ","Not Applicable","10","Unavailable","623216371","G4ALRBCZ52G7","623216371","G4ALRBCZ52G7","US","40.768905","-73.986187","7924903","ST.

7. Project Narrative:
 Accumulation of excess visceral fat (central or ""apple-shaped"" obesity) is associated with increased risk of
type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, whereas accumulation of subcutaneous adipose (peripheral or ""pear-
shaped"" obesity) does not have such a risk. Recently, we have demonstrated that certainly fundamental
developmental genes may play a role in this process. In this study we will determine the role of these genes in
adipocyte determination and differential function of adipocytes from visceral and subcutaneous depots through
studies over-expressing or knocking out there expression in preadipocytes in culture and in genetically
engineered mice in vivo.","NIDDK","7567215","3/5/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01DK082659-01","1","R01","DK","082659","01"," ","HAFT, CAROL R","3/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","Integrative Physiology of Obesity and Diabetes Study Section[IPOD]"," ","1863670","KAHN, C RONALD","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","071723084","UUUMQVGJNNX1","071723084","UUUMQVGJNNX1","US","42.346758","-71.10256","2133701","JOSLIN DIABETES CENTER","BOSTON","MA","Research Institutes","022155306","UNITED STATES","N","3/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2010 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDDK"," "," "," ","621244",

 Diabetes is a major public health concern in the United States, accounting for 180 billion dollars in
annual health costs. Diabetes-induced impairments in new blood vessel growth greatly increase the severity of
the sequelae caused by various ischemic processes, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular
disease, peripheral vascular disease and impaired wound healing. Recovery from ischemic injury requires
new blood vessel growth, termed neovascularization.","NIDDK","7827415","7/13/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R56DK074095-06","2","R56","DK","074095","06"," ","JONES, TERESA L Z","9/30/2005 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","Surgery, Anesthesiology and Trauma Study Section[SAT]"," ","7053106","GURTNER, GEOFFREY C","BROWNLEE, MICHAEL A","18","SURGERY","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","US","37.429038","-122.178178","8046501","STANFORD UNIVERSITY","STANFORD","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","943052004","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","OD"," "," "," ","500000",

Project Narrative
Bone remodeling occurs throughout adult life, and requires that osteoblasts (bone
forming cells) and osteoclasts (bone removing cells) work in concert to maintain bone
mass. Osteopenia results when new bone formation cannot keep pace with bone
resorption, leading to a weakened skeleton, increased risk of fracture, and osteoporosis,
an incapacitating disease of increased prevalence with aging. As changes in BMP
activity in adult bone have been associated with osteoporosis and in the reduced ability
to heal fractures that occur with aging (Badley, 1995; Enomoto-Iwamoto et al., 1998;
Mundy et al., 1999; Rountree et al., 2004; Styrkarsdottir et al., 2003), and our data
identify BMP2 as key to normal BMP activity in adults, we believe developing a greater
understanding of the way BMP2 regulates bone homeostasis is highly relevant to
improving the health of the aging US population.","NIAMS","7728204","8/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01AR055904-01A2","1","R01","AR","055904","01","A","SHARROCK, WILLIAM J","8/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1944055","ROSEN, VICKI ","Not Applicable","07","DENTISTRY","047006379","JDLVAVGYJQ21","047006379","JDLVAVGYJQ21","US","42.335814","-71.105033","3212902","HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL","BOSTON","MA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","021201616","UNITED STATES","N","8/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","381375",

Narrative
The objective of this study is to develop new techniques for monitoring engineered chondrogenic tissues using
magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance elastography. Magnetic resonance imaging provides
three dimensional views of developing tissue at all stages of growth without the need to sacrifice the animal or
to biopsy the tissue. Magnetic resonance elastography gives a direct measure of the strength and stiffness of
regenerating tissue: critical information needed to guide the design of new methods of tissue engineering and
to assess the success of tissue implants for restoring tissue damaged by disease, injury or cancer treatment.","NIBIB","7626649","4/20/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-06-504","1R01EB007537-01A2","1","R01","EB","007537","01","A","HUNZIKER, ROSEMARIE","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","ZEB1-OSR-D(J1)S"," ","1903069","MAGIN, RICHARD L","Not Applicable","07","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","098987217","W8XEAJDKMXH3","098987217","W8XEAJDKMXH3","US","41.880316","-87.687597","577703","UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO","Chicago","IL","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","606124305","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2010 12:00:00 AM","286","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIBIB"," "," "," ","395606",

Project Narrative
A significant clinical need exists for novel implant materials capable of promoting the repair and regeneration of
injured or compromised tissues, such as damaged articular cartilage. Indeed, as cartilage has a limited natural
capacity to repair itself, damage to articular cartilage and underlying bone often leads to considerable clinical
problems that afflict million of people worldwide, including pain, limited mobility and osteoarthritis. The research
project presented in this proposal seeks to apply advanced cell culture technologies to fabricate biologically

Narrative
The overall goal of this proposal is to define the basis for a mouse model of the human
blood disease, myelodyplasia and to identify compounds that might positively affect the
bone marrow. We will use a unique combination of mouse and zebrafish model systems
examined by molecular, chemical and imaging techniques.","NHLBI","7756336","9/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-09-010","1R01HL097794-01","1","R01","HL","097794","01"," ","THOMAS, JOHN","9/5/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-W(M1)"," ","1861205","SCADDEN, DAVID T","Not Applicable","08","Unavailable","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","US","42.347465","-71.082058","4907701","MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021142621","UNITED STATES","N","9/5/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","839","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","622525",

Project Narrative
Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) is a novel molecule important for lung cancer progression. This study
will evaluate the role of HDGF as a prognostic marker for identifying lung cancer patients likely to recurr or

Augmentation of Trabecular Bone by Low Magnitude Strain
This work will investigate the mechanisms behind the anabolic potential of extremely low-
magnitude mechanical signals, and how they strengthen both bone and muscle. Research over the
last period of funding has also shown that these signals markedly suppress adiposity, by
influencing the differentiation pathway of mesenchymal stem cells rather than elevating the
animal's metabolism, indicating a previously unrecognized mechanical means of the regulating
fat and bone production. This research will provide the foundation to translate this work to the
clinic as a safe, non-pharmacologic, intervention for the control of osteoporosis and obesity.","NIAMS","7688652","7/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR043498-09","5","R01","AR","043498","09"," ","SHARROCK, WILLIAM J","12/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1864044","RUBIN, CLINTON T","Not Applicable","01","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","804878247","M746VC6XMNH9","804878247","M746VC6XMNH9","US","40.907353","-73.128565","5992612","STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK","STONY BROOK","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","117943362","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","345294",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Relevance. Our studies will elucidate molecular mechanisms that control cell division in
osteoblasts, as a component of normal development and maintenance of bone tissue. Our
studies focus on a transcription factor that is critical for bone formation in human and mouse,
and genetic inactivation of this protein has been linked to human bone disease (e.g.,
cleidocranial dysplasia). This program will examine how deregulation of Runx2 may contribute
to osteosarcomas, a prevalent pediatric cancer. Insight into Runx2 control of osteoblast
proliferation may also yield an understanding of mechanisms to control osteogenic

Project Narrative
 Ischemic heart disease is the number one cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In
the past decade, animal studies have shown that transplantation of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs),
endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and skeletal myoblasts (SKMs) into the infarcted myocardium can
improve cardiac function. These exciting data led to the initiation and completion of phase 1-2 clinical trials
involving stem cell transplantation in cardiac patients. However, results from more recent large randomized
clinical trials on SKMs, EPCs, and BMSCs are inconclusive, raising further questions as to their true
efficacy. One of the main concerns is the possibility that the aforementioned cell types may not
transdifferentiate into cardiomyocytes and thus failing to adopt the necessary cellular phenotypes necessary
for long-term engraftment in the heart. By contrast, human embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes
(hESC-CMs) possess these characteristics. However, immunological intolerance and bioethical concerns
still stand as major obstacles for their clinical translation in the future. Here we propose a novel strategy to
bypass these two issues by using induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs).
 iPS cells are genetically modified by the integration of three to four DNA transcription factors into the
adult cell genome. Although iPS cells represent a significant advance in stem cell research, many difficulties
remain to be resolved to realize their full potential. Two major questions concern their safety and efficacy.
To those ends, this multi-disciplinary project will investigate the following aspects: (1) to improve the yield of
iPS cells using human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) instead of fibroblasts; (2) to use safe non-viral and
non-immunogenic minicircle plasmid as vectors; (3) to develop novel reprogramming strategies using
microRNAs; (4) to characterize the functionality of iPSC-CMs compared to hESCs; (5) to define the network
of genes involved in maintaining pluripotency and regulating differentiation using a systems biology
approach; and (6) to apply state-of-the-art molecular imaging technology to track the fate and function of

NARRATIVE
 Wounds and burns frequently scar and fail to regenerate the original architecture of the skin.
Certain strains of mice heal skin much better in some regions of their body, and part of this may be due
to differences in their circulating stem cells or the way they are recruited to the wound. This is a study to
identify the cell signals that differ between normal healing and regeneration, to see how they affect the
behavior of stem cells, and to devise a temporary, synthetic scaffold that can deliver these regenerative
signals to restore skin structure and function.","NIAMS","7741307","8/24/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01AR056138-01A2","1","R01","AR","056138","01","A","BAKER, CARL","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","1869024","DAVIDSON, JEFFREY M.","GUELCHER, SCOTT A; NANNEY, LILLIAN B; OPALENIK, SUSAN RENEE","05","PATHOLOGY","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","US","36.140134","-86.796274","8721001","VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY","Nashville","TN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","372032408","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","688323",

Project narrative
Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass, with the elderly particularly
susceptible, and it affects the quality of life as well as increasing mortality, due to
complications. A unique prevention strategy by controlling balance of bone formation
and fat cell formation from bone marrow stem cell by conjugated linoleic acid can
potentially be a very useful tool for preventing the development of osteoporosis, leading
to improved quality of life particularly in the elderly.","NCCIH","7811660","9/14/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-058","3R21AT004456-02S1","3","R21","AT","004456","02","S","KHALSA, PARTAP SINGH","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","ZAT1-PK(07)"," ","8849849","PARK, YEONHWA ","Not Applicable","02","NUTRITION","153926712","VGJHK59NMPK9","153926712","VGJHK59NMPK9","US","42.387293","-72.520638","850904","UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST","HADLEY","MA","EARTH SCIENCES/RESOURCES","010359450","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCCIH"," "," "," ","152098",

cancers. Diabetes is known to be associated with disturbed skeletal homeostasis and an increased risk for
fracture. Malignant metastases to bone are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Thus, elucidation of
the role of AMPK in bone may provide important insights into new strategies to address skeletal disease.","NIAMS","7685852"," ","RFA-AR-08-003","2P30AR046032-11","2","P30","AR","046032","11"," "," ","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","ZAR1-CHW-G(M1)","7272","1883046","WU, DIANQING ","Not Applicable","03","Unavailable","043207562","FL6GV84CKN57","043207562","FL6GV84CKN57","US","41.303164","-72.931644","9420201","YALE UNIVERSITY","NEW HAVEN","CT","Domestic Higher Education","065208327","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM"," ","Research Centers","2009","50869","50869"," "," "," "," "," ",

This RC1 application proposes to test a novel hypothesis that the implicit memory exists in osteocyte networks
under mechanical loading. The real-time intracellular calcium waves in response to various patterns of fluid
flow stimulation will be analyzed to study the three elementary forms of implicit learning, i.e., habituation,
sensitization, and classical conditioning, in in vitro osteocytic networks. The mechanotransduction mechanisms
have a great importance in understanding the etiology of osteoporosis and preventing bone loss in space.","NIAMS","7827060","9/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-003","1RC1AR058453-01","1","RC1","AR","058453","01"," ","SHARROCK, WILLIAM J","9/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-C(58)R]"," ","1880521","GUO, X.

 Wounds that do not heal appreciably reduce patient quality of life, especially for those individuals who
are of advanced age and/or suffer from diabetes. Effective wound care treatments are therefore of significant
public health concern. This study will utilize bioengineering to generate novel devices to determine those
molecules and conditions that enhance the recruitment, proliferation and differentiation of specific stem cell
populations. It is anticipated that data obtained from the proposed experiments will be useful in designing
therapeutic modalities to enhance wound repair, decrease scarring, and produce a better clinical outcome.","NIBIB","7661224","4/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-418","1R21EB007611-01A2","1","R21","EB","007611","01","A","HUNZIKER, ROSEMARIE","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Instrumentation and Systems Development Study Section[ISD]"," ","8052869","OPALENIK, SUSAN RENEE","Not Applicable","05","PATHOLOGY","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","US","36.140134","-86.796274","8721001","VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY","Nashville","TN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","372032408","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","286","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIBIB"," "," "," ","218438",

This application is designed to develop human inducible pluripotent stem (IPS) cells from skin biopsies, which are
capable to differentiate into typical mature bone forming cells (osteoblasts). The goal of this investigation is to obtain
osteoblasts from patients with rare bone disorders for detailed studies of disease mechanisms, which would otherwise not
be possible. We chose to create IPS-derived osteoblasts from patients with craniometaphyseal dysplasia (CMD), a
debilitating genetic bone disorder, because we have very interesting data from a mouse model for CMD but it is currently

7. Project Narrative
Non-viral gene delivery offers is an ideal approach to alter cellular behavior at the molecular level through
the delivery of plasmid DNA that encodes for a gene of interest. However, the efficiency of gene transfer is
too low to achieve the levels required for therapeutic application. In this proposal we are exploring new
avenues to enhance the process of gene transfer through exploiting the natural response of cells to the
extracellular matrix.","NIBIB","7740292","7/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-418","1R21EB009516-01A1","1","R21","EB","009516","01","A","HENDERSON, LORI","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Biomaterials and Biointerfaces Study Section[BMBI]"," ","8786069","SEGURA, TATIANA ","Not Applicable","33","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","092530369","RN64EPNH8JC6","092530369","RN64EPNH8JC6","US","34.104809","-118.41105","577505","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES","LOS ANGELES","CA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","900952000","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","286","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIBIB"," "," "," ","176723",

Project Narrative
This project focuses on understanding the regulation of a bone matrix protein that is critical for the
maintenance of bone mass. This protein is called osteonectin or SPARC, and polymorphisms in the gene
coding for this protein are associated with bone density in humans. Information obtained from these studies
could be used to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of osteoporosis, and may be
used to identify individuals at risk for developing osteoporosis.","NIAMS","7652983","7/27/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01AR044877-11A2","2","R01","AR","044877","11","A","SHARROCK, WILLIAM J","8/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1878695","DELANY, ANNE M","Not Applicable","05","OTHER BASIC SCIENCES","022254226","H6D6JMXJXDE6","022254226","H6D6JMXJXDE6","US","41.733439","-72.797053","1506603","UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT","FARMINGTON","CT","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","060305335","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","336428",

SUMMARY OF WORK
In the proposal, we attempt to understand the epigenetic basis underlying the process that induces a na�ve
somatic adult-derived stem cell to differentiate into a cardiomyocyte. Our general hypothesis is nuclear Ca2+
oscillations induce hMSCells to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. We study this in co-cultures with neonatal
cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo in the mouse heart.","NHLBI","7661180","7/16/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01HL091348-01A2","1","R01","HL","091348","01","A","ADHIKARI, BISHOW B","7/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CVS-D(02)M]"," ","1865965","KIRBY, MARGARET LOEWY","Not Applicable","04","PEDIATRICS","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","US","36.006824","-78.924579","2221101","DUKE UNIVERSITY","DURHAM","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","277054673","UNITED STATES","N","7/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","648787",

We propose exploratory experiments to develop a method of reprogramming cells of other lineages to the
blood lineage, with the objective of finding alternate sources of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow
transplantation. If successful, direct reprogramming to blood-forming stem cells would enable immune
tolerance for organ transplantation, genetic correction and syngeneic transplantation for genetic diseases of
the blood, and expand the donor pool for patients in need of bone marrow transplantation.","NHLBI","7811558","9/21/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-003","1RC1HL099478-01","1","RC1","HL","099478","01"," ","MONDORO, TRACI","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-VH-D(58)R]"," ","8136811","KYBA, MICHAEL ","Not Applicable","05","PEDIATRICS","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","US","44.974119","-93.227014","1450402","UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA","MINNEAPOLIS","MN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","554552070","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","354349",

Obesity is a major public health problem. We propose to elucidate how maternal programming of adipose
tissue development is influenced by endocrine disrupting chemicals that activate PPAR� and whether
circulating MSCs contribute to adipose development. The successful completion of this research will make
important contributions to understanding the maternal programming of obesity, how obesogens affect this
process, and what is the contribution of altered stem cell programming.","NIEHS","7807840","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R01ES015849-03S1","3","R01","ES","015849","03","S","HEINDEL, JERROLD","9/20/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/19/2012 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-EMNR-A(95)S]"," ","1900163","BLUMBERG, BRUCE ","Not Applicable","45","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","046705849","MJC5FCYQTPE6","046705849","MJC5FCYQTPE6","US","33.678042","-117.773718","577504","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE","IRVINE","CA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","926970001","UNITED STATES","N","9/20/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/19/2012 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIEHS"," "," "," ","612000",

Intermediate Filaments (IF) are structural proteins that are involved in determining cell shape,
cell movement, mechanical integrity, and nuclear architecture. However, their specific functions
remain unknown. We propose basic studies aimed at understanding their specific functions in
the movement and mechanical properties of cells. These basic studies of the structure and
function of IF will not only provide insights into understanding their normal functions, but also
in determining their defective functions in the many diseases attributed to mutations in the
genes encoding the different types of IF proteins.","NIGMS","7737624","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01GM036806-24","2","R01","GM","036806","24"," ","GINDHART, JOSEPH G","7/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Cell Structure and Function Study Section[CSF]"," ","1883247","GOLDMAN, ROBERT D","Not Applicable","07","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","005436803","KG76WYENL5K1","005436803","KG76WYENL5K1","US","41.896017","-87.616602","6144650","NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO","CHICAGO","IL","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","606114579","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIGMS"," "," "," ","444919",

Health relevance:
Remodeling of the airway epithelium is a common pathological feature in chronic lung disease and a
predisposing factor in the development of lung cancer. Accordingly, understanding cellular and

The proposed research will advance our understanding of how oncogenic viruses promote
neoplastic disease in humans through cooperation with cellular oncoproteins. Using HTLV-1 as a
model for viral carcinogenesis, we have gained novel insight regarding the molecular bases for
modulation of c-MYC functions by transforming viruses. These studies may lead to the development
of targeted therapeutic strategies to inhibit c-MYC oncogenic functions in hematological

Health relevance:
Remodeling of the airway epithelium is a common pathological feature in chronic lung disease and a
predisposing factor in the development of lung cancer. Accordingly, understanding cellular and
molecular mechanisms of epithelial maintenance and repair are fundamental to the development of
improved therapeutic modalities for the treatment of chronic lung disease. We hypothesize that after
epithelial injury, the surrounding non-epithelial cells get reprogrammed to contribute, directly and
indirectly be secreting growth factors, to the epithelial repair.","NHLBI","7590663","2/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01HL092967-01A1","1","R01","HL","092967","01","A","BLAISDELL, CAROL J","3/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","Lung Injury, Repair, and Remodeling Study Section[LIRR]"," ","9220162","DE LANGHE, STIJN PIET JOHAN","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","076443019","VLQKFEEJ3NE9","076443019","VLQKFEEJ3NE9","US","39.738343","-104.942796","5720901","NATIONAL JEWISH HEALTH","DENVER","CO","Independent Hospitals","802062761","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2010 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","390000",

Project Narrative:
The development of a non-invasive imaging technique for differentiation between viable and non-viable donor
stem cells is crucial for monitoring of virtually any stem cell based therapy. A better understanding of the signal
behavior of contrast agent labeled viable and apoptotic hMSC on MR images could help to investigate the
mechanisms that control stem cell death and lead the way to a more effective use of hMSC-based therapies
for arthritis. Results should be immediately helpful in preclinical assessments of hMSC-based therapies of
arthritis and other joint pathologies, in the design of related clinical trials, and later, in the assessment of those
stem cell based therapies in clinical practice.","NIAMS","7687939","6/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR054458-02","5","R01","AR","054458","02"," ","LESTER, GAYLE E","9/15/2008 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","8527084","DALDRUP-LINK, HEIKE ELIZABETH","Not Applicable","12","RADIATION-DIAGNOSTIC/ONCOLOGY","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","US","37.78689","-122.448998","577508","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO","SAN FRANCISCO","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","941432510","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","274693",

Project Narrative
As the aged population increases the need for novel therapeutic approaches to musculoskeletal pathology will
also increase. Tissue engineering exploiting adult stem cells is one such approach. This project will develop
novel musculoskeletal tissue engineering protocols combining nanotechnology, adult stem cells and
biophysical forces that will lead to strategies to replace bone loss to disease, injury and aging.","NIAMS","7662826","2/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01AR054937-01A2","1","R01","AR","054937","01","A","WANG, FEI","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","1865703","DONAHUE, HENRY J","Not Applicable","10","ORTHOPEDICS","129348186","TNKGNDAWB445","129348186","TNKGNDAWB445","US","40.26536","-76.625873","1524204","PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR","HERSHEY","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","170332360","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","350614",

NARRATIVE
Intervertebral disc degenerative disorders and resulting pain may be associated with aging- or pathology-
related cell loss, and changes in cell phenotype. Cellular therapies for biologically-driven regeneration of
intervertebral disc are of great interest, whereby disc cells from human patients or progenitor cells are used to
generate new matrix in vitro or following re-implantation in vivo. This project will use a cell sorting technology
to identify a population of disc cells which retain characteristics of an immature cell phenotype, and to
investigate the key contributors or therapeutic targets for maintaining this immature cell-like phenotype and
matrix synthesis during cell regeneration.","NIAMS","7792514","9/27/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01AR057410-01A1","1","R01","AR","057410","01","A","WANG, FEI","9/28/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","7624497","CHEN, JUN ","Not Applicable","04","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","US","36.006824","-78.924579","2221101","DUKE UNIVERSITY","DURHAM","NC","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","277054673","UNITED STATES","N","9/28/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","268200",

Project Narrative
Bone healing is complex process involving a number of different factors. Although the delivery of BMPs as
recombinant proteins can induce local bone formation and healing of bone defects, we have demonstrated
previously that local gene transfer of BMPs results in more rapid and efficient bone healing. We have shown
that gene transfer of the LIM Mineralization Protein (LMP) can induce osteogenesis and bone formation as or
more efficiently than BMP-2. The goals of this proposal are to identify the domains in LMP required for
osteogenesis, to begin to examine the mechanisms through which LMP is able to induce osteogenesis and to
examine the ability of the LMP-based domains to induce bone formation in vivo following gene and protein-
transduction mediated delivery. The successful completion of the proposal experiments will lead to a better

Cell-cell fusion is a topic spanning many disciplines of biology and medicine, including fertility, development
and repair of muscle and bone, vision, and immunity to infection. It is also an important aspect of the life cycle
of many parasitic and viral pathogens. Understanding the mechanisms by which diverse cell types fuse, and
the ways in which cell engineering via cell fusion can be applied in medicine, will advance the aim of the NIH to
improve human health. This meeting stimulates communication between researchers in the various systems in
which cell fusion is under study.

population of cells that displays stem cell properties. These properties include self-renewal which drives
tumorigenesis and differentiation which generates the tumor bulk. Recent in vitro and animal model studies
have shown that cancer stem cells, including those of the breast, are relatively resistant to radiation therapy
and chemotherapy. There is considerable evidence that the microenvironment regulates normal mammary
development as well as tumor growth and metastasis. Since cancer stem cells may drive tumorigenesis and

High-grade gliomas (also known as glioblastoma mutiforme) are the fastest growing type of central
nervous system tumors in humans. They are invariably associated with a bad prognosis. Recently, two
intrinsic capabilities of glioblastoma multiforme have been recognized as key traits of malignancy, the
ability to invade adjacent normal brain and produce new blood vessels. There is general agreement that
the current failures in the treatment of high-grade gliomas are mostly caused by lack of effective tools
against these features of aggressive brain tumors. This grant proposal uses cutting-edge computational
technologies recently developed at Columbia University Medical Center to exploit microarray expression
profiles from a large collection of primary glioblastoma multiforme and identify the key genetic master
regulators responsible for the most aggressive attributes of malignant gliomas (""the mesenchymal
signature""). We will perform a series of state-of-the-art experiments in cell culture systems and
experimental animals to validate the predictions made by the new algorithms. We anticipate that the
identification of the master genetic programs directing the most aggressive features of malignant gliomas
will offer the best possible targets for therapeutic intervention.","NINDS","7761428","8/24/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-08-184","1R01NS061776-01A2","1","R01","NS","061776","01","A","FOUNTAIN, JANE W","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CB-J(02)M]"," ","6189067","IAVARONE, ANTONIO ","Not Applicable","13","NEUROLOGY","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","US","40.841253","-73.940404","1833205","COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","100323725","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","853","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NINDS"," "," "," ","466524",

Project Narrative
This project develops a clinically-relevant approach to cartilage repair using MSC-laden hydrogels with temporally
controlled structures subjected to physiologic mechanical conditioning to mimic the developmental paradigm of
tissue formation and maturation that occurs from the embryo to adulthood. This biomaterial system provides
receptor-matrix interactions, controlled mechanics, and tailored degradation profiles to enhance the differentiation of
encapsulated MSCs and the accumulation and distribution of formed extracellular matrix (ECM). If successful, this
approach would surmount a major hurdle in cartilage tissue engineering to provide a more structurally relevant ECM
with enhanced mechanical properties to support the intense loads found in the joint. This cartilage tissue
engineering technique could aid in the treatment of millions of patients afflicted with debilitating cartilage loss and
degeneration due to trauma or disease.","NIBIB","7653444","4/7/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-279","1R01EB008722-01A1","1","R01","EB","008722","01","A","HUNZIKER, ROSEMARIE","4/13/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","7261809","BURDICK, JASON A","MAUCK, ROBERT L","03","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","US","39.952982","-75.192768","6463801","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","191046205","UNITED STATES","N","4/13/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2010 12:00:00 AM","286","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIBIB"," "," "," ","344029",

PROJECT NARRATIVE:
Currently, the benefit of adult stem-cell therapy appears to be limited to vascular
repair; myogenesis and/or myocardial regeneration seem to be unaffected.
Although the potential for improved vascularization with EPC therapy will likely
provide considerable clinical benefit to patients with acute myocardial infarction
and chronic heart failure, techniques that can consistently regenerate cardiac
myocytes are still of great interest. Thus, the development of autologous stem
cells with enhanced lineage plasticity for subsequent testing in the setting of
myocardial ischemia is an integral part of stem-cell research and it could be
effectively used in cell therapy for regenerative medicine.","NHLBI","7707835","8/14/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","1R21HL097349-01","1","R21","HL","097349","01"," ","BUXTON, DENIS B","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Myocardial Ischemia and Metabolism Study Section[MIM]"," ","9645222","JOHNSON, RAJASINGH ","Not Applicable","07","PHARMACOLOGY","098987217","W8XEAJDKMXH3","098987217","W8XEAJDKMXH3","US","41.880316","-87.687597","577703","UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO","Chicago","IL","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","606124305","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","196250",

Project Narrative
 Seven million people suffer bone fractures annually in the U.S. Musculoskeletal conditions cost $215
billion/year. These numbers are increasing as the population ages. This project will develop the first
generation of injectable, strong, tough, macroporous, bone mineral-mimicking nano-apatite scaffolds with stem
cell and multiple growth factor delivery, and will study bone regeneration in animal models. Potential
applications include dental, craniofacial and orthopedic repairs. They include maxillary and mandibular
reconstruction and minimally-invasive surgeries such as filling and strengthening osteoporotic bone lesions,
with greatly enhanced bone healing and regeneration to improve the health and quality of life for millions of
people.","NIDCR","7640147","3/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01DE014190-07A1","2","R01","DE","014190","07","A","DRUMMOND, JAMES","4/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Oral, Dental and Craniofacial Sciences Study Section[ODCS]"," ","2093590","XU, HUAKUN ","Not Applicable","07","DENTISTRY","188435911","Z9CRZKD42ZT1","188435911","Z9CRZKD42ZT1","US","39.291412","-76.624753","820104","UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE","BALTIMORE","MD","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","212011508","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","273260",

A previously unrecognized function of amelogenin proteins is to stimulate the differentiation of stem
cells towards bone formation while suppressing their differentiation into fat forming cells. This switch
is activated by amelogenin stimulating the Wnt signaling cascade. Utilizing amelogenin proteins may
improve surgical correction of birth defects, trauma and tumor induced bone loss by providing a
means to stimulate bone formation replacing foreign materials with real bone.","NIDCR","7812613","9/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R01DE006988-23S1","3","R01","DE","006988","23","S","SHUM, LILLIAN","9/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-K(95)S]"," ","1888310","SNEAD, MALCOLM L.","ZHOU, YAN ","37","DENTISTRY","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","US","34.065915","-118.196446","7636101","UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA","Los Angeles","CA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","900894304","UNITED STATES","N","9/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","399886",

7. PROJECT NARRATIVE
Osteoarthritis represents the most prevalent joint disease and is a major cause of disability. Disease-modifying
therapies are not available and this is in part related to an incomplete understanding of pathogenetic
mechanisms. Specifically, osteoarthritic lesions begin at the articular cartilage surface which is important in
biomechanical function and joint lubrication and then progress to larger lesions with complete loss of cartilage.
Information on the causes of the initial cartilage surface defects is very limited. Our preliminary studies show
that the chromatin protein HMGB2 is exclusively expressed in the superficial zone of articular cartilage from
human and murine joints. With advancing age there is a reduction and loss of HMGB2 expression that is
followed by loss of cartilage cells and the onset of degenerative changes in the cartilage surface. These
observations suggest that HMGB2 is a critical factor for maintaining the integrity of the cartilage surface and
that its aging-related loss is a central pathogenetic mechanism in osteoarthritis. The proposed research has
the potential to identify new avenues for the prevention and treatment of osteoarthritis.","NIAMS","7736234","6/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01AR056026-01A2","1","R01","AR","056026","01","A","TYREE, BERNADETTE","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","1864057","LOTZ, MARTIN K","Not Applicable","49","Unavailable","781613492","PHZJFZ32NKH4","781613492","PHZJFZ32NKH4","US","32.903152","-117.243436","7375802","SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE","LA JOLLA","CA","Research Institutes","920371000","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","427275",

Project Narrative
The replacement or restoration of function to traumatized, damaged, or lost organs and tissues is an
increasingly significant clinical problem. It is estimated that only 24,422 received organ transplants of a
possible 79,512 patients on the transplantation wait list in 2002. In addition, it is currently estimated that over
1.5 million skeletal injuries alone will require tissue graft reconstruction in the US each year, and these
numbers will continue to grow as the life expectancy of the population increases. Thus, the development of
effective strategies to harness inflammation for revascularization and regeneration of osseous tissue defects is
a significant medical need.","NIDCR","7728926","6/4/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-DE-09-001","1R01DE019935-01","1","R01","DE","019935","01"," ","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","6/5/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZDE1-RW(11)"," ","2108099","BOTCHWEY, EDWARD A.","Not Applicable","05","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","065391526","JJG6HU8PA4S5","065391526","JJG6HU8PA4S5","US","38.034207","-78.512346","1526402","UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA","CHARLOTTESVILLE","VA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","229044195","UNITED STATES","N","6/5/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","364942",

Project Narrative
Dental diseases such as periodontal disease, tooth decay and tooth loss, account for billions of
dollars in health expenditures annually in the United States. Bone loss is a common component
of these diseases and is due both to reduced bone formation and increased bone breakdown.
In the course of our work, we have identified a novel and hitherto unrecognized regulator of

the mechanisms by which the loss of LIM kinase 1 function impairs bone formation. This may
lead to new approaches to correcting bone loss in the oral cavity.","NIDCR","7845978","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R01DE012459-11S1","3","R01","DE","012459","11","S","SHUM, LILLIAN","12/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-A(95)S]"," ","1858923","INSOGNA, KARL LEONARD","Not Applicable","03","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","043207562","FL6GV84CKN57","043207562","FL6GV84CKN57","US","41.303164","-72.931644","9420201","YALE UNIVERSITY","NEW HAVEN","CT","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","065208327","UNITED STATES","N","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","248250",

Project Narrative:
This proposal will study stem cells isolated from a common childhood tumor known as infantile
hemangioma. We hope to understand how and why these stem cells have become disrupted, such
that instead of following a normal healthy pathway to become normal cells and tissue, the
hemangioma-derived stem cells form a mass of disorganized blood vessels that grows dramatically
during infancy. The results from this study may lead to new, fast-acting and safe treatments for
children with endangering hemangiomas. In addition, the studies may provide fundamental insights
into the behavior of human vascular progenitor cells which could then be applied to strategies to use
such progenitor cells for tissue repair and regeneration, and specifically to build healthy vascular
networks.","NHLBI","7677133","3/18/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01HL096384-01","1","R01","HL","096384","01"," ","MCDONALD, CHERYL","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Cardiovascular Differentiation and Development Study Section[CDD]"," ","1917530","BISCHOFF, JOYCE E.","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","US","42.340629","-71.094923","1504801","BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021155724","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","425000",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Current treatment for hemophilia A, which is a bleeding disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting a blood
protein, termed factor VIII (fVIII), relies on infusion of plasma-derived or recombinant fVIII to restore circulating
fVIII activity. This therapy is extremely expensive and difficult to maintain, and is, therefore, only offered to 30%
of hemophilia A patients worldwide. Gene therapy can cure the disease and this proposal focuses on
overcoming the obstacles that limit successful gene therapy for hemophilia A.","NHLBI","7612581","1/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-051","2R42HL083531-02","2","R42","HL","083531","02"," ","LINK, REBECCA P","9/1/2006 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-HEME-D(10)B]"," ","2123578","DOERING, CHRISTOPHER BRADLEY","SPENCER, H TRENT","04","Unavailable","361719755","PBQBKK5QY571","361719755","PBQBKK5QY571","US","33.836972","-84.256913","10006052","EXPRESSION THERAPEUTICS","TUCKER","GA","Domestic For-Profits","300845709","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","839","SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","706219",

biophysical forces that will lead to strategies to replace bone loss to disease, injury and aging.","NIAMS","7847285","6/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R01AR054937-01A2S1","3","R01","AR","054937","01","A2S","WANG, FEI","6/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","1865703","DONAHUE, HENRY J","Not Applicable","10","ORTHOPEDICS","129348186","TNKGNDAWB445","129348186","TNKGNDAWB445","US","40.26536","-76.625873","1524204","PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR","HERSHEY","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","170332360","UNITED STATES","N","6/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","OD"," "," "," ","32571",

Narrative
Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) from bone marrow have shown the potential to
repair or regenerate ischemic cardiovascular tissues; however, there still remain
concerns regarding the identity and underlying therapeutic mechanisms. We recently
identified a novel population of bone marrow-derived CD31 positive cells which have
angiogenic and genuine vasculogenic properties. In this proposal, we propose to
identify genuine EPCs which have vasculogenic and/or angiogenic properties by narrow
downing the CD31 subfractions.","NHLBI","7728238","9/14/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","1R21HL097353-01","1","R21","HL","097353","01"," ","BUXTON, DENIS B","9/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CVS-Q(90)]"," ","7938624","YOON, YOUNG-SUP ","Not Applicable","05","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","066469933","S352L5PJLMP8","066469933","S352L5PJLMP8","US","33.762977","-84.42296","2384501","EMORY UNIVERSITY","ATLANTA","GA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","303224250","UNITED STATES","N","9/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","232500",

PROJECT RELEVANCE
We will examine the mechanisms by which the use of female sex hormones after trauma will improve cell and
organ functions and decrease the lethality from infectious complications. We will use state-of-the-art molecular
techniques and cell-based therapy to delineate the mechanisms involved in injury pathogenesis. The funding
will help to develop gender-specific therapy. Such therapy should prevent organ dysfunction after injury and
reduce morbidity and mortality from subsequent sepsis in male and female trauma victims.","NIGMS","7583733","1/27/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01GM039519-23","2","R01","GM","039519","23"," ","SOMERS, SCOTT D","2/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-SBIB-E(02)M]"," ","2419504","CHAUDRY, IRSHAD H","Not Applicable","07","SURGERY","063690705","YND4PLMC9AN7","063690705","YND4PLMC9AN7","US","33.506935","-86.809252","1288803","UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM","BIRMINGHAM","AL","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","352940001","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIGMS"," "," "," ","391500",

Project Narrative:
The development of a non-invasive imaging technique for differentiation between viable and non-viable donor
stem cells is crucial for monitoring of virtually any stem cell based therapy. A better understanding of the signal
behavior of contrast agent labeled viable and apoptotic hMSC on MR images could help to investigate the
mechanisms that control stem cell death and lead the way to a more effective use of hMSC-based therapies
for arthritis. Results should be immediately helpful in preclinical assessments of hMSC-based therapies of

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Congenitally missing teeth are a consequence of gene mutations which interrupt the process of normal tooth
development. Only a few of these genes have been identified. We propose to discover additional genes and
show how several of these genes interact in normal tooth development and what disturbs their interaction in
patients with missing teeth.","NIDCR","7567876","11/17/2008 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01DE019471-01","1","R01","DE","019471","01"," ","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-K(09)F]"," ","1878805","D'SOUZA, RENA N.","Not Applicable","17","OTHER BASIC SCIENCES","835607441","HFT7XTHB6563","835607441","HFT7XTHB6563","US","30.561517","-96.274978","8266910","TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCE CTR","COLLEGE STATION","TX","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","778454375","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","345781",

Project Narrative
The epicardium is a sheet of cells that covers heart muscle tissue. Recently, there has been
increased interest in epicardium because of its role in forming the blood vessels of the fetal
heart, and the potential that this activity can be reactivated in the mature heart. We have found
that epicardium can also form heart muscle cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to define
the cells and signals that the epicardium contributes to the developing and postnatal heart.
These experiments will prepare the foundation for future studies on potential therapeutic uses
of epicardium as a source of cells and signals to treat heart failure.","NHLBI","7566834","12/29/2008 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01HL094683-01","1","R01","HL","094683","01"," ","SCHRAMM, CHARLENE A","1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CVS-D(02)M]"," ","2107930","PU, WILLIAM TSWENCHING","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","US","42.340629","-71.094923","1504801","BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021155724","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","423334",

TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:
 Obesity is characterized by an increase in adipose tissue mass due to hypertrophy of existing fat cells
and through the generation of new adipocytes (hyperplasia). New adipocytes arise from resident
preadipocytes and interstitial mesenchymal stem cells. Conversion of these precursor cells to mature
adipocytes requires the temporally orchestrated expression of transcription factors including C/EBPs � and �,
and PPAR�, which leads to the expression of factors associated with the mature adipocyte phenotype. Our
studies have shown that activation of the transcription factor CREB is also required to induce adipogenic
conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. CREB activation also protects mature adipocytes from apoptosis in vitro.
While much has been learned from these in vitro studies, the role of CREB in adipose biology has not been
explored in animal models.
 Recent preliminary studies show that CREB levels are diminished in adipose tissue from obese mice
and rats. This may account, in part, for the increased adipocyte apoptosis and suppression of adipogenesis
observed in obese individuals. It may also account for the infiltration of fat tissue from obese subjects with
macrophages, since inhibition of CREB activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes not only induces their apoptosis, but also
increases expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), macrophage migration inhibitory factor-1
(MIF-1), macrophage colony stimulating factor-1 (MCSF-1), CXC ligand 13, stromal cell-derived factors -1
(SDF-1) and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (MCP-3). Our preliminary studies have led us to propose two
hypotheses related to CREB function in adipose biology. First, we hypothesize that CREB is required for
adipogenesis, adipose tissue development, and adipocyte survival (Fig.1). Second, we hypothesize that loss
of CREB in apoptotic adipocytes promotes the recruitment or retention of macrophages in adipose tissue via
the upregulation of ICAM-1, MCSF-1, MIF-1, CXCL13, SDF-1 and/or MCP-3.
 Four Specific Aims will test these hypotheses using in vivo and in vitro models. Aim 1 will test
whether forced depletion of CREB in preadipocytes inhibits adipogenesis in vivo, and whether forced loss of
CREB in adipocytes induces their apoptotic death in vivo. Aim 2 will investigate the impact of adipocyte-
specific CREB depletion on adiposity and whole animal physiology. Aim 3 will determine whether forced loss
of CREB in adipocytes alone or both adipocytes and macrophages promotes macrophage recruitment to
adipose tissue. The fourth Aim will explore the ability of forced CREB depletion in adipocytes to promote
macrophage recruitment and/or adhesion to adipocytes in vitro. We anticipate that these studies will define the
impact of CREB on adipose tissue formation and function in animal models, and highlight CREB and
associated factors and processes as potential targets for therapies designed to treat or prevent obesity and
other adipose disorders.","NIDDK","7692857","6/16/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK053969-11","5","R01","DK","053969","11"," ","HAFT, CAROL R","8/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","Integrative Physiology of Obesity and Diabetes Study Section[IPOD]"," ","1866151","KLEMM, DWIGHT J","Not Applicable","06","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","US","39.708143","-104.724958","1199905","UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER","Aurora","CO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","800452570","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDDK"," "," "," ","311408",

Project Narrative
The epicardium is a sheet of cells that covers heart muscle tissue. Recently, there has been
increased interest in epicardium because of its role in forming the blood vessels of the fetal
heart, and the potential that this activity can be reactivated in the mature heart. We have found
that epicardium can also form heart muscle cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to define
the cells and signals that the epicardium contributes to the developing and postnatal heart.
These experiments will prepare the foundation for future studies on potential therapeutic uses
of epicardium as a source of cells and signals to treat heart failure.","NHLBI","7842099","7/16/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R01HL094683-01S1","3","R01","HL","094683","01","S","SCHRAMM, CHARLENE A","7/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CVS-D(02)M]"," ","2107930","PU, WILLIAM TSWENCHING","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","US","42.340629","-71.094923","1504801","BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021155724","UNITED STATES","N","7/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","248553",

Narrative
Breast cancer stem cells are responsible for driving tumor growth and are currently
poorly understood. Breast cancer stem cells are also resistant to current anti-cancer
treatments, indicating that they are major barriers to effective treatment. We propose to
collaborate with the MLPCN to employ a novel, validated high-throughput cell-based
screen to identify selective inhibitors of breast cancer stem cells.","NIMH","7844618","9/28/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-09-129","1R03MH089663-01","1","R03","MH","089663","01"," ","YAO, YONG","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/29/2010 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BST-J(50)R]"," ","1876444","LANDER, ERIC S","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","623544785","H5G9NWEFHXN4","623544785","H5G9NWEFHXN4","US","42.363318","-71.087781","10021177","BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.","CAMBRIDGE","MA","Research Institutes","021421027","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/29/2010 12:00:00 AM","310","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","OD"," "," "," ","41100",

Cancer spreads and invades through a process called metastasis, often resulting in patient death. The
metastasis process is not well understood, since there is a shortage of well-controlled models that realistically

Patients with HER2- or hormone receptor negative breast cancer cannot be successfully
treated with hormonal therapy or the HER2-targeting agents, and they are at high risk for
dying of metastatic disease. The proposed work has the potential to lead to the
development of new targeted therapy for those breast cancer patients who do not have

PROJECT NARRATIVE
We propose the use of nanotechnology approaches for controlling interfaces between the hip
and knee implants and the surrounding tissues. The primary focus of this grant application is to
improve the fixation, durability and osseointegration for long-term success of Total Joint
Replacements and lower the need for recurrent multiple surgical procedures. Also, development
of new nanotechnology tools and methods will lead to a new class of functionalized
nanostructured surfaces for titanium and cobalt chrome alloys for use in biomedical implant
industry. One benefit of the diamond-diamond components will be reductions in overall device
size that will ultimately allow for a clinically less-invasive route to joint restoration and longer
implant lifetime in vivo.","NIAMS","7726334","6/19/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-07-352","1R01AR056665-01A1","1","R01","AR","056665","01","A","PANAGIS, JAMES S","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-B(03)M]"," ","6490731","VOHRA, YOGESH K.","Not Applicable","07","PHYSICS","063690705","YND4PLMC9AN7","063690705","YND4PLMC9AN7","US","33.506935","-86.809252","1288803","UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM","BIRMINGHAM","AL","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","352940001","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","197606",

Project Narrative
Using viruses to kill tumor cells has shown considerable promise in the laboratory and in early clinical trials.
Yet several obstacles must be overcome before this strategy gains acceptance as a safe and potent form of
cancer therapy. The applicant has constructed a virus from herpes simplex virus type 2, called FusOn-H2,
which has produced encouraging antitumor activity in animal tumor models. He now propose to develop and
test different strategies for improving FusOn-H2 virotherapy, with the long-term goal of translating this
treatment into a clinically feasible option for patients with malignant sold tumors.","NCI","7579620","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA132792-01A1","1","R01","CA","132792","01","A","WELCH, ANTHONY R","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","Developmental Therapeutics Study Section[DT]"," ","7740876","ZHANG, XIAOLIU ","Not Applicable","09","PEDIATRICS","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","US","29.711148","-95.39695","481201","BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","HOUSTON","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","770303411","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","202620",

This project mimics how nature assembles proteins and DNA to build a cell-recognizing
phage particle to fabricate a gene delivery nanoparticle that can carry and protect
therapeutic DNA inside and bear multiple target-recognizing peptide motifs on the
surface. Such nanoparticle can be used to deliver therapeutic gene to the desired cells
and tissues in non-viral gene therapy. Accomplishment of this project will advance the
fields of gene delivery and cancer treatment such as treating diseases that require new
blood vessel formation and delivering therapeutic agents to the desired tumor cells and
tissues to treat cancers.","NHLBI","7737268","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-052","1R01HL092526-01A2","1","R01","HL","092526","01","A","DANTHI, NARASIMHAN","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Nanotechnology Study Section[NANO]"," ","8693419","MAO, CHUANBIN ","Not Applicable","04","CHEMISTRY","848348348","EVTSTTLCEWS5","848348348","EVTSTTLCEWS5","US","35.233502","-97.347078","1524002","UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN","NORMAN","OK","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","730199705","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","401096",

Recent advances in the integration of computational and experimental methods for the understanding of
cancer biology are creating unique opportunities to improve our ability to identify biomarkers for early
diagnosis and prevention, therapeutic targets that are highly specific to a cancer type, and compounds that
inhibit these targets. Investigators at the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center have pioneered
these type of approaches an implemented a completely integrated computational-experimental approach
to the study of cancer called Cancer Systems Biology.
 In this proposal, we articulate the vision of a center that will use cancer systems biology tools to
identify and prioritize candidate therapeutic targets and to design highly specific molecular screening
approaches for the identification of small molecules that inhibit these targets. In particular, we have
shown that Master Regulators of tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance can be identified both
computationally and experimentally and that these genes provide ideal targets for therapy, either
individually or in combination, i.e. using more than one drug.
 We propose to study three tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance problems, including (a)
the mesenchymal signature of Glioblastoma (GBM) associated with the worst clinical outcome in patients
with High-Grade Gliomas (HGG), (b) the transformation of Follicular Lymphoma (FL) into Diffuse
Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), and (c) Glucocorticoid resistance in T cell Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia (T-ALL).

 RELEVANCE
 Osteoporosis is a disease with severe bone loss and a significantly
increased risk of low trauma fractures. Male osteoporosis, compared with
female osteoporosis, has higher mortality rate upon fractures. This project
aims to identify proteins that are important to male osteoporosis. The findings
will provide essential scientific basis for effective prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of the disease.","NIAMS","7742808","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01AR057049-01A1","1","R01","AR","057049","01","A","SHARROCK, WILLIAM J","9/18/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-HOP-T(02)M]"," ","6616034","DENG, HONG-WEN ","Not Applicable","05","OTHER BASIC SCIENCES","010989619","J9CDGR596MN3","010989619","J9CDGR596MN3","US","39.034521","-94.575773","578004","UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI KANSAS CITY","KANSAS CITY","MO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","641102446","UNITED STATES","N","9/18/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","659322",

This grant proposal will investigate the significance of novel type II collagen (Col2a1 gene)
alternative transcripts within the context of skeletal development, primarily by generation of a
recombinant mouse model. Very few mouse models to study the importance of alternative
splicing sites have been developed to date. Since alternative splicing of collagen type II mRNA
is a key element of skeletogenesis, the development of a knock-in model to study the role of
collagen II splicing in skeletal development is an important step forward in the field of connective
tissue biology. The importance of alternative splicing in the production of genetic diversity has
become evident in recent years, and alternative splicing-related knock-in mice will be required
for numerous other genes in the future. We also anticipate that the mouse model developed in
this study will shed light upon other developmental processes that have been shown to involve
expression of type II collagen. Type IIA procollagen mRNA is expressed at relatively low levels
during development in a number of embryonic non-cartilage tissues such as the notochord,
somitic mesoderm, fetal brain, spinal cord, developing eye, tendons and ligaments. Additional
work on this project will investigate the mechanisms for regulating the amount of each
alternatively spliced mRNA type during differentiation and development.","NCRR","7741114","9/28/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-336","1R21RR025397-01A1","1","R21","RR","025397","01","A","O'NEILL, RAYMOND R","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","1902041","HERING, THOMAS MARTIN","MCALINDEN, AUDREY ","01","ORTHOPEDICS","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","US","38.647241","-90.300814","9083901","WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY","SAINT LOUIS","MO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","631304862","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","389","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCRR"," "," "," ","228000",

Project Narrative
Relevance to Public Health:
Radiation exposure leads to the development of severe acute inflammatory response and late
damage to the lung culminating in delayed fibrosis. Pulmonary endothelium is the locus of early
structural and functional changes in irradiation induced lung injury and apoptosis of pulmonary
endothelium is a major contributing factor to genesis of acute radiation lung injury and
maintenance of delayed responses. Nonetheless, the early molecular pathways that account for
irradiation induced pulmonary endothelial cell apoptosis are unknown. The proposed project will
elucidate specific mechanisms of early apoptotic events in mitochondria and employ novel
targeting protocols of antioxidants/electron scavengers to pulmonary endothelium (using
immuno-nanoparticles) and mitochondria that represent a new strategy in drug discovery.","NHLBI","7727736","8/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01HL094488-01A1","1","R01","HL","094488","01","A","MOORE, TIMOTHY M","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Radiation Therapeutics and Biology Study Section[RTB]"," ","1864636","KAGAN, VALERIAN E","Not Applicable","18","PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","US","40.444001","-79.956102","2059802","UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH","PITTSBURGH","PA","SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH","152133320","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","378750",

Blood vessels are made up of two cell layers; endothelial cells comprise the inner luminal layer
of vessels and mural cells (pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells) make up the
surrounding vessel wall and control blood flow and vessel stability. We are studying how
communication between endothelial cells and mural cells helps to promote vessel formation and
stability. Insights gained from our developmental studies may help to develop clinical strategies
for treating common diseases including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and cancer.","NHLBI","7750472","7/27/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01HL077675-05A1","2","R01","HL","077675","05","A","RABADAN-DIEHL, CRISTINA","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CVS-F(02)M]"," ","7354338","HIRSCHI, KAREN KEMPER","BURT, JANIS M","09","PEDIATRICS","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","US","29.711148","-95.39695","481201","BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","HOUSTON","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","770303411","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","388844",

The identification of new genes involved in craniofacial/tooth development will increase
our knowledge about the basic development programs required for normal
embryogenesis. Understanding how these components interact to promote normal
craniofacial development will further our understanding of genetic defects. We can then

Project Narrative
At some point in most everyone's life, joint integrity will be diminished either through trauma, disease,
aging, or congenital defects. The research outlined in this proposal offers a way to study, for the first
time, how tissues of the limb are able to initiate regeneration of a joint. By studying this process,
investigators will be that much closer to achieving regenerative repair in humans.","NICHD","7842434","7/9/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HD-07-021","3R15HD060012-01S1","3","R15","HD","060012","01","S","JAVOIS, LORETTE CLAIRE","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","10/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","ZHD1-MRG-C(15)"," ","9350238","ANDERSON, ROSALIE ","Not Applicable","01","BIOLOGY","008203309","LCB6RKRFBSC3","008203309","LCB6RKRFBSC3","US","29.933314","-90.121275","4691101","LOYOLA UNIVERSITY IN NEW ORLEANS","NEW ORLEANS","LA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","701186143","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","10/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","OD"," "," "," ","5013",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Our studies conducted over the last few years have identified a signaling molecule called the hypoxia-inducible
factor that controls these processes. The goal of our research is to understand the cellular and molecular
mechanisms, which couple angiogenesis in bone formation. Successful completion of this work should lead to
novel approaches for the treatment of bone development and regeneration.","NIAMS","7652170","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01AR049410-06","2","R01","AR","049410","06"," ","SHARROCK, WILLIAM J","8/1/2004 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","6799588","CLEMENS, THOMAS L","Not Applicable","07","ORTHOPEDICS","001910777","FTMTDMBR29C7","001910777","FTMTDMBR29C7","US","39.329164","-76.617855","4134401","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY","BALTIMORE","MD","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","212182680","UNITED STATES","N","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","371952",

Project Narrative
At some point in most everyone's life, joint integrity will be diminished either through trauma, disease,
aging, or congenital defects. The research outlined in this proposal offers a way to study, for the first
time, how tissues of the limb are able to initiate regeneration of a joint. By studying this process,
investigators will be that much closer to achieving regenerative repair in humans.","NICHD","7572329","1/7/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HD-07-021","1R15HD060012-01","1","R15","HD","060012","01"," ","JAVOIS, LORETTE CLAIRE","1/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/14/2012 12:00:00 AM","ZHD1-MRG-C(15)"," ","9350238","ANDERSON, ROSALIE ","Not Applicable","01","BIOLOGY","008203309","LCB6RKRFBSC3","008203309","LCB6RKRFBSC3","US","29.933314","-90.121275","4691101","LOYOLA UNIVERSITY IN NEW ORLEANS","NEW ORLEANS","LA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","701186143","UNITED STATES","N","1/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/14/2012 12:00:00 AM","865","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NICHD"," "," "," ","212936",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
There are a variety of congenital disorders that have been attributed to mutations
affecting transcriptional regulation. This work will provide insight into those mutations
through a comparative analysis of genes in the ""network"" that is responsible for skeleton
formation in sea urchins. Specifically, this work focuses on the functional consequence
of changes in genes and their cis-regulatory sequences with regard to protein-binding
affinity, patterns of gene expression in the embryo, and/or phenotype.","NICHD","7570371","2/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HD-07-021","1R15HD059927-01","1","R15","HD","059927","01"," ","COULOMBE, JAMES N","2/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","ZHD1-MRG-C(15)"," ","6772997","ROMANO, LAURA A","Not Applicable","12","BIOLOGY","069059111","DTBBEX8V3F26","069059111","DTBBEX8V3F26","US","40.069205","-82.518385","2084301","DENISON UNIVERSITY","GRANVILLE","OH","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","430231100","UNITED STATES","N","2/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","865","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NICHD"," "," "," ","206456",

Congenital heart disease affects .8% of all liveborn infants, and is the most common major birth defect. Cilia
are antenna-like structures that extend from almost all cells to obtain and interpret information from the
extracellular environment, and abnormal cilia are known to cause some types of complex congenital heart
disease. This proposal investigates how cilia function in the developing heart to instruct normal heart
development.","NHLBI","7647697","3/13/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01HL093280-01A1","1","R01","HL","093280","01","A","SCHRAMM, CHARLENE A","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cardiovascular Differentiation and Development Study Section[CDD]"," ","1865261","BRUECKNER, MARTINA ","Not Applicable","03","PEDIATRICS","043207562","FL6GV84CKN57","043207562","FL6GV84CKN57","US","41.303164","-72.931644","9420201","YALE UNIVERSITY","NEW HAVEN","CT","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","065208327","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","397375",

NARRATIVE
Stem cells have the potential to ameliorate or perhaps even cure neurodegenerative
diseases such as stroke. We aim to develop a new imaging technique that uses
magnetic particles for visualizing transplanted stem cells in the brain. If this new
technique is developed succesfully, it will help us to understand much better where the
cells exactly go into the brain and elsewhere in the body, which will facilitate introducing
these stem cells into patients.","NIDA","7636735","5/21/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-GM-08-002","5R01DA026299-02","5","R01","DA","026299","02"," ","AIGNER, THOMAS G","7/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","ZNS1-SRB-P(44)"," ","7039588","BULTE, JEFF W","Not Applicable","07","RADIATION-DIAGNOSTIC/ONCOLOGY","001910777","FTMTDMBR29C7","001910777","FTMTDMBR29C7","US","39.329164","-76.617855","4134401","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY","BALTIMORE","MD","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","212182680","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","279","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDA"," "," "," ","328000",

Project Narrative:
This project will investigate the potential of allogeneic bone marrow stem cells to correct
heritable metabolic errors in an out-bred strain of cats. We will isolate adult bone marrow
stem cells (MSCs) from cats with normal lipoprotein lipase activity and inject them into
cats lacking lipoprotein lipase activity. In this project we will investigate several different
methods for increasing this response and methods to enhance engraftment of these
cells and prolong these therapeutic effects.","NCRR","7660549","6/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-336","1R21RR025235-01A1","1","R21","RR","025235","01","A","HARDING, JOHN D","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Gene and Drug Delivery Systems Study Section[GDD]"," ","1959112","VULLIET, PHILIP RICHARD","Not Applicable","03","VETERINARY SCIENCES","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","US","38.543675","-121.729989","577503","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS","DAVIS","CA","SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE","956186153","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","389","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCRR"," "," "," ","218900",

NARRATIVE
Vascular calcification in atherosclerotic plaques is a prominent feature of atherosclerosis, a major cause of
mortality and morbidity in the United States. We have demonstrated an essential role of Runx2 in vascular
calcification in vitro. This proposal will further characterize role of Runx2 in vascular calcification in vivo and
investigate the Runx2-regulated molecular signals in oxidative stress-induced vascular calcification. These
studies will provide important molecular insights into understanding the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, which

Project Narrative
Immunosenescence is an important contributor to increased incidence of disease and reduced quality of life
with aging. A key component of immunosenescence is thymic involution, but the mechanisms underlying this
process are poorly understood. Steroid hormones, especially androgens, are thought to be major contributors
to involution, and androgen blockade can result in thymic regeneration. The current proposal seeks to identify
the cellular and molecular targets of androgen signaling in the postnatal thymus and during thymic rebound.","NIA","7785422","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-AG-09-011","1R01AG035302-01","1","R01","AG","035302","01"," ","FULDNER, REBECCA A","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","ZAG1-ZIJ-5(A1)"," ","1886122","MANLEY, NANCY R","BLACKBURN, CLARE ","10","GENETICS","004315578","NMJHD63STRC5","004315578","NMJHD63STRC5","US","33.933474","-83.375853","676602","UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA","ATHENS","GA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","306021589","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","866","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIA"," "," "," ","297000",

The development of a transgenic mouse model that allows for the inducible and reversible augmentation or

microenvironments. It can also be exploited to study the mechanisms by which MSC bring about tissue
regeneration, which is critical for optimizing this promising mode of therapy.","NIDDK","7739561","8/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-06-172","1R03DK082757-01A1","1","R03","DK","082757","01","A","BISHOP, TERRY ROGERS","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Kidney, Urologic and Hematologic Diseases D Study Section[DDK-D]"," ","7845210","PILLAI, MANOJ M.","Not Applicable","06","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","US","39.708143","-104.724958","1199905","UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER","Aurora","CO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","800452570","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDDK"," "," "," ","68725",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed studies are of an important and under-investigated area of cerebral aneurysm pathophysiology
that would directly translate into therapies that could treat cerebral aneurysms, such as 1) endovascular
devices carrying signaling mechanisms that reverse the degenerative inflammatory process and promote
vascular repair, and 2) medical drug therapies that arrest the degenerative inflammatory process and stabilize
aneurysms from growing and progressing to rupture. The proposed research has relevance to the public
health and the Nation's economic well-being because there is a significant incidence of cerebral aneurysms in

New targeted therapies are needed for cancer patients that improve survival and
decrease side-effects of therapy. Ewing's Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) are
highly malignant tumors of bone and soft tissue that occur in children,
adolescents, and young adults. The tumors often grow in close proximity to
bone, but can occur as a soft-tissue mass. Current standard therapy for ESFT
patients is a five-drug regimen that lasts for approximately 9 months. Patients
who present with localized ESFT have approximately 70% disease-free survival.
Patients who present with metastatic ESFT have a poor prognosis (20% disease-
free survival) despite intensive therapy. These clinical response rates have
persisted for the past decade, even after dose-intensifying chemotherapy and
bone marrow transplantation. The identification of a Ewing's Sarcoma Stem Cell
(ESSC) and elucidation of its properties will be critical to advancing both novel
and effective therapies into patients with ESFT. Our identification of ESSC along
with the use of a novel inhibitor of EWS-FLI1 are directly responsive to the RFA-
CA-08-019. This project will specifically address the need for new targeted
therapies for ESFT and potentially a large number of related malignancies that
have chromosomal translocations.","NCI","7693834","7/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-CA-08-019","5R01CA138212-02","5","R01","CA","138212","02"," ","KOPELOVICH, LEVY","9/25/2008 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","ZCA1-RPRB-O(O2)"," ","6182845","TORETSKY, JEFFREY A","Not Applicable","98","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","049515844","TF2CMKY1HMX9","049515844","TF2CMKY1HMX9","US","38.904729","-77.016304","2869001","GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY","WASHINGTON","DC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","200570001","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","495302",

Project Narrative
 This is a proposal to study how the skull forms and how two genes-Msx2 and Msx2-control the
shape of bones of the skull. Msx genes are of special interest because humans with mutations in MSX2 and
MSX2 have birth defects that affect their skulls and teeth. By studying how these genes work, we will learn
more about basic processes of skull development as well as how mutations in Msx1 and 2 lead to birth defects.
In the long term, this work may help to devise new treatments of such birth defects.","NIDCR","7634384","3/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01DE019650-01","1","R01","DE","019650","01"," ","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1891907","MAXSON, ROBERT E.","Not Applicable","37","BIOCHEMISTRY","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","US","34.065915","-118.196446","7636101","UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA","Los Angeles","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","900894304","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","387125",

Project Narrative
Aging causes many changes in cells that eventually result in declines in body function, frailty, and increased
susceptibility to diseases. The possibility that these cellular aging changes are reversible has been raised by
recent studies that show that it is possible to take skin cells from adults and reprogram them to an embryonic
stem cell-like state. In this proposal we will test the effects of aging on the ability to reprogram skin cells from
marmoset monkeys, in which there is the potential of retransplanting embryonic stem cell-like cells back into
the donor animal to test a therapeutic effect.","NIA","7740395","8/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","1R21AG033286-01A1","1","R21","AG","033286","01","A","KOHANSKI, RONALD A","8/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Cellular Mechanisms in Aging and Development Study Section[CMAD]"," ","1878064","HORNSBY, PETER J","Not Applicable","21","PHYSIOLOGY","800772162","C3KXNLTAAY98","800772162","C3KXNLTAAY98","US","29.513082","-98.577731","578418","UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER","SAN ANTONIO","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","782293901","UNITED STATES","N","8/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","866","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIA"," "," "," ","152170",

Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) protein is important for dentin formation as DSPP mutations
cause dentinogenesis imperfectas, the most common dentin genetic diseases. Here, we propose a
novel pathway for DSPP transcriptional regulation, proteolytic processing and signaling transduction
pathway for dentinogenesis. Thereafter, better understanding of the mechanisms of DSPP biological

Lens fibrotic disease causes lens opacities leading to the formation of cataracts which
block vision. The exact etiology of lens fibrotic disease is unknown and the long term
goals of this project are to understand the role of a subpopulation of G8pos skeletal
muscle stem cells, which are located in the lens and emerge from their stem cell niche
upon injury, in the induction of lens fibrotic disease. Elucidation of such mechanisms
could not only broaden our understanding of stem cell behavior in response to
injury-induced changes to their niche but also lead to the development of anti-fibrotic
therapeutics to preserve vision.","NEI","7639113","7/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","1R21EY019571-01","1","R21","EY","019571","01"," ","ARAJ, HOUMAM H","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Anterior Eye Disease Study Section[AED]"," ","9462626","WALKER, JANICE LYNN","Not Applicable","03","PATHOLOGY","053284659","R8JEVL4ULGB7","053284659","R8JEVL4ULGB7","US","39.949004","-75.155569","4050801","THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY","PHILADELPHIA","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","191074418","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NEI"," "," "," ","228208",

Project Narrative
This is a proposal to study a gene named Pten which controls the number of
Progenitor/Stem cells in the lung. The studies address the specific role of Pten in a

PROJECT NARRATIVE
This project proposes to study the function of two signaling pathways, Shh and Wnt, in both early
androgen-independent and late sexually dimorphic phases of external genitalia development.
Genital malformations including hypospadias occur at a very high rate but their etiology remains
largely unknown. Using several conditional knockout mice, this project will reveal the downstream
signaling events of these two important pathways and how they interact with each other and the
androgen signaling pathway to regulate genital morphogenesis and masculinization. Our studies
will contribute greatly to the understanding of external genitalia development and the etiology of
hypospadias.","NIEHS","7656161","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01ES016597-01A1","1","R01","ES","016597","01","A","HEINDEL, JERROLD","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","Urologic and Kidney Development and Genitourinary Diseases Study Section[UKGD]"," ","1974052","MA, LIANG ","Not Applicable","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","US","38.647241","-90.300814","9083901","WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY","SAINT LOUIS","MO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","631304862","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2010 12:00:00 AM","113","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIEHS"," "," "," ","321999",

Lay summary
Arterial calcification is one of the potential outcomes of blood vessel repair in
atherosclerosis, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and aging. Artery calcification
promotes mortality in these conditions and our objective is to identify new targets for
therapies. In this project, we will define and test proposed mechanisms whereby linked
changes in an enzyme (Vanin-1) involved in defense against oxidative stress, and the

The current research proposal is every relevant to the care of veterans who have 
experienced traumatic injury in active combat theaters. Characterization of the types of 
combat injuries observed in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi 
Freedom (OIF) has shown that traumatic bone injury is a prevalent problem. In fact the 
types of combat injuries observed in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation 
Iraqi Freedom (OIF) has shown that 26% of all extremity wounds are fractures (Owens 
BD, Kragh, Jr JF, Macaitis J, Svoboda SJ, Wenke JC. Characterization of extremity 
wounds in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. J Orthop 
Trauma 21:254-257, 2007). Head and face trauma accounts for 2% - 20% of combat 
injuries depending on the theater of Middle East conflict. Thus traumatic bone injury is 
found to be associated with active military campaigns. In those traumatic bone injuries 
that either heal slowly or do not heal, or in the case of facial and skull bone injuries that 
could also have attendant visual or hearing deficits or traumatic brain injury, increased 
morbidity, long-term rehabilitation, and even long-term disabilities are faced by such 
veterans that take a toll on the veterans themselves, their families, and the financial 
resources of the country. It is important to understand the early events in bone repair. 
These events include the generation of new bone forming cells called osteoblasts from 
more primitive cells from bone marrow (e.g. mesenchymal stem cells), and the 
restoration of new blood supply to bone. Re-establishing blood supply to bone by a 
process called angiogenesis (the sprouting of new blood vessels from existing blood 
vessels after injury) is necessary and critical for bone repair to occur. Knowledge of these 
key elements in bone repair may help to develop and deliver therapies that would hasten 
bone healing to restore bone to pre-morbid levels of strength and soundness.","VA","7683429","3/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-08-002","1I01BX000170-01","1","I01","BX","000170","01"," "," ","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Endocrinology B[ENDB]"," ","9443584","YAMAGUCHI, DEAN T","Not Applicable","33","Unavailable","066689118","DL46AKJ5YD48","066689118","DL46AKJ5YD48","US","34.104809","-118.41105","481012","VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM","LOS ANGELES","CA","Independent Hospitals","900731003","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

Public Health Relevance Statement
 The studies proposed will shed light on the process of tumor initiation and
progression and enhance our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in lung
cancer. The finding that Rac1b might function as an oncogene and that loss of Rac1 is
""lethal"" in the context of activated K-ras raises the possibility that targeting Rac1 in Ras-
mutated tumors would be therapeutically beneficial with, perhaps, limited toxicity towards
normal cells. Given the prevalence of Ras mutations in human cancer these finds could

PROJECT NARRATIVE
It is the long-term objective of this study to understand the process of root development and periodontium
formation at the morphological, cellular and molecular levels. This includes the mechanisms underlying root
dentin, cementum and periodontal ligament formation which lead to root attachment in the healthy
periodontium. This application will focus on the role of the transcription factor NFI-C which appears to be
essential for periodontium formation. The data generated in this study is of great health relevance to
understand genetic defects resulting in root agenesis and periodontium defects which result in premature tooth
loss. Additionally, understanding root and periodontium development is critical to establish genetical and tissue
engineering therapies for periodontium regeneration.","NIDCR","7697120","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-011","1R01DE019792-01","1","R01","DE","019792","01"," ","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-K(09)S]"," ","1880421","ZEICHNER-DAVID, MARGARITA ","Not Applicable","37","DENTISTRY","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","US","34.065915","-118.196446","7636101","UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA","Los Angeles","CA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","900894304","UNITED STATES","N","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","396500",

Narrative
This proposal investigates the contribution and clinical significance of decreased Rap1GAP
expression to the progression of human thyroid tumors. Studies in human thyroid tumor cell
lines will elucidate the mechanism through which downregulation of Rap1GAP attenuates
cell/cell adhesion and investigate whether loss of Rap1GAP enhances migratory and invasive
potential. Studies in human tumor specimens will identify the subtypes of thyroid tumors that
exhibit Rap1GAP downregulation, assess whether decreased expression of Rap1GAP is
correlated with the presence of metastatic disease at presentation, examine whether Rap1GAP
expression is further decreased in lymph node metastases compared to primary tumors and
assess whether Rap1GAP expression is correlated with the presence of angioinvasion or
lymphoinvasion, markers of poor prognosis.","NCI","7580565","6/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA127986-01A2","1","R01","CA","127986","01","A","SNYDERWINE, ELIZABETH G","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology Study Section[MCE]"," ","1939700","MEINKOTH, JUDY L","Not Applicable","03","PHARMACOLOGY","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","US","39.952982","-75.192768","6463801","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","191046205","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","329925",

NARRATIVE
Vascular calcification in atherosclerotic plaques is a prominent feature of atherosclerosis, a major cause of
mortality and morbidity in the United States. We have demonstrated an essential role of Runx2 in vascular
calcification in vitro. This proposal will further characterize role of Runx2 in vascular calcification in vivo and
investigate the Runx2-regulated molecular signals in oxidative stress-induced vascular calcification. These
studies will provide important molecular insights into understanding the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, which
will leads to development of novel strategy or drugs for atherosclerosis prevention or therapy.

This research is relevant to public health in several ways. First it will determine how muscle mass in the legs
contributes to fracture risk. Second it will identify genes that increase the risk for osteoporosis. This may
eventually lead to better identification of individuals who are at increased risk for fracture in the future.","NIAMS","7731775","7/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R01AR041398-18S1A1","3","R01","AR","041398","18","S1A","CHEN, FAYE H","9/30/1991 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","Neurological, Aging and Musculoskeletal Epidemiology Study Section[NAME]"," ","1860781","KIEL, DOUGLAS P.","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","030832075","WS29EMGEVEJ4","030832075","WS29EMGEVEJ4","US","42.296902","-71.13239","9512301","HEBREW REHABILITATION CENTER FOR AGED","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021311000","UNITED STATES","N","7/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","278495",

Public Health Relevance
In a nuclear warfare or terrorist incident, combined injury by radiation and burn wounding
is likely. We will provide a better mechanistic understanding of the molecular biology
behind healing of combined injury wounds, and will test a non-invasive assay for wound
healing success and a potential therapy to improve healing. All of this would be of
considerable public health benefit in such a scenario.","NIAID","7872006","7/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-AI-07-038","3R21AI080604-02S1","3","R21","AI","080604","02","S","DICARLO-COHEN, ANDREA L","7/22/2008 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","ZAI1-BDP-I(M3)"," ","1973299","ROCKE, DAVID M.","ISSEROFF, ROSLYN R.","03","PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","US","38.543675","-121.729989","577503","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS","DAVIS","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","956186153","UNITED STATES","N","7/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAID"," "," "," ","46448",

Project Narrative
 Seven million people suffer bone fractures annually in the U.S. Musculoskeletal conditions cost $215
billion/year. These numbers are increasing dramatically as the population ages. This project will develop the
first injectable, moderate load-bearing, macroporous, bone-mimicking nanofiber-apatite scaffolds with stem cell
and multiple growth factor delivery, and will study bone regeneration in animal model. Potential applications
include dental, craniofacial and orthopedic repairs. They include maxillofacial reconstruction using the
moldable scaffold to achieve shaping and esthetics, and minimally-invasive surgeries such as filling and

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder caused by insufficiency of a blood clotting factor, designated factor VIII, for
which gene therapy offers a potential cure. However, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials showed that a major
limitation to a successful gene therapy treatment is the extremely poor expression of fVIII from the human fVIII
transgene, which we recently overcame by introducing a porcine fVIII transgene. We demonstrated that use of
the porcine transgene results in up to 100-fold greater fVIII production than the human version, and more
recently, we demonstrated that a similar differential is observed following gene transfer into blood stem cells
using recombinant retroviruses. Our current studies focus on better understanding the critical pharmacologic
parameters involved in generating curative fVIII levels with this procedure using a mouse model of hemophilia
A with the goal of understanding how this application can best be translated to clinical successes.","NHLBI","7655083","3/20/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01HL092179-01A2","1","R01","HL","092179","01","A","LINK, REBECCA P","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","Gene and Drug Delivery Systems Study Section[GDD]"," ","2123578","DOERING, CHRISTOPHER BRADLEY","SPENCER, H TRENT","05","PEDIATRICS","066469933","S352L5PJLMP8","066469933","S352L5PJLMP8","US","33.762977","-84.42296","2384501","EMORY UNIVERSITY","ATLANTA","GA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","303224250","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2010 12:00:00 AM","839","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","379250",

Myocardial infarction is the leading cause of congestive heart failure in the industrialized western world. This
proposal will study the powerful antiischemic effect of clinically approved, long acting erectile dysfunction
drug, tadalafil on stem cells for their enhanced survival and angiomyogenic differentiation after transplantation
into the infarcted heart. The proposed study using the PDE5A inhibitors may identify a potential therapeutic

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Multiple myeloma is a B-cell malignancy characterized by the infiltration and growth of plasma cells in the
bone marrow. Patients with MM develop osteolytic bone disease permanently in the skull, ribs,
vertebrae, pelvis, and long bones of the limb, characterized by bone pain, pathologic fractures, and
hypercalcemia, making this a major cause of morbidity. Despite advances in chemotherapy regimens
used to treat patients with MM, the median length of survival after diagnosis of the disease is
approximately three years. Thus, newer therapies targeting multiple events of myeloma cell growth and
proliferation, including bone microenvironment and tumor vasculature need to be developed for
increasing patient survival. The central hypothesis of the proposed work is bone-targeted, genetically
engineered MSC therapy capable of inhibiting osteoclast activity by stable expression of OPG will be an
effective treatment for decreasing osteolytic bone lesions in MM. By combining the OPG therapy with
tumor-targeted chemotherapy and tumor vasculature-targeted anti-angiogenic gene therapy we seek to
establish a novel treatment paradigm for MM in a preclinical mouse model. Successful completion of

The outcomes of cell-based therapies to treat myocardial infarction are controversial
with some positive, some negative, and even some detrimental results. However, we
opine that treatment of acute myocardial infarction with stem cells may not be the
most effective use for regenerative therapies, rather stimulation of coronary collateral
growth is likely the most likely strategy to produce an immediate benefit in the
treatment of ischemic heart disease using regenerative therapies. Our goals are to
determine which adult stem cell, and under what specific conditions, best stimulates
coronary collateral growth in the heart.","NHLBI","7831321","9/21/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-003","1RC1HL100828-01","1","RC1","HL","100828","01"," ","BUXTON, DENIS B","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-VH-D(58)R]"," ","1884788","CHILIAN, WILLIAM M","Not Applicable","16","OTHER BASIC SCIENCES","077779882","MJL7LEL4B6M6","077779882","MJL7LEL4B6M6","US","41.104231","-81.242578","1164401","NORTHEAST OHIO MEDICAL UNIVERSITY","ROOTSTOWN","OH","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","442720095","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","500000",

Project Narrative
There is accumulating evidence to show that infants who are delivered following growth restriction during the
fetal period have significant lung morbidity during their postnatal life. Further, since the mechanism of this lung
morbidity is not known, there is no specific intervention to prevent it. Using a well established rat model of
intrauterine growth restriction and the state-of-the-art technology, we propose studies that will unravel the
fundamental molecular mechanism (s) of pulmonary dysfunction in the growth restricted offspring, allowing us
to design novel intervention strategies that may not only prevent, but also reverse intrauterine growth
restriction associated lung damage during postnatal life.","NICHD","7739532","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-180","1R03HD058948-01A1","1","R03","HD","058948","01","A","RAJU, TONSE N","9/20/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Pediatrics Study Section[CHHD-A]"," ","6717879","REHAN, VIRENDER K","Not Applicable","43","Unavailable","069926962","LTJVF4QSFCP9","069926962","LTJVF4QSFCP9","US","33.834898","-118.292983","2543101","LUNDQUIST INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION AT HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER","TORRANCE","CA","Research Institutes","905022006","UNITED STATES","N","9/20/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NICHD"," "," "," ","68480",

Project Narrative
 Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating disease of the lung that leads
to loss of normal structure/function and permanent scarring of the lung tissue. The
incidence of IPF in the U.S. population is 30/100,000. Currently, the natural cause of IPF
is unknown, and there are no effective treatments with a median survival of 2.8-4.2 yrs.
The studying the function of miRNAs has made huge impact on several critical disease,
such as lung cancer, diabetes and heart failure. Nothing, however, is known about
miRNAs in IPF. We have previously reported critical components of the microRNA
machinery in the developing lungs. Our preliminary studies have identified several
microRNAs selectively enriched in the embryonic and adult lung. Here we hypothesize
that IPF may have cell type specific miRNA expression signatures, and that
characterizing these signatures may provide the basis for the identification of disease
biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We propose that miRNA signatures can be identified
and further characterized by using microRNA array and in situ hybridization approaches
and utilizing the tissues from Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC).","NHLBI","7690861","7/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-08-008","5R03HL095415-02","5","R03","HL","095415","02"," ","REYNOLDS, HERBERT Y","9/19/2008 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-D(S1)"," ","12571907","LU, JINING ","CARDOSO, WELLINGTON V.","07","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","604483045","FBYMGMHW4X95","604483045","FBYMGMHW4X95","US","42.336234","-71.070647","894901","BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS","BOSTON","MA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","021182841","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","81250",

Project Narrative: Cleft palate represents one of the most frequent human birth defects. This
complex birth defect is caused by both multigenic and environmental contributions. Despite the
frequent occurrence, relatively little is known about the developmental and genetic basis that
leads to a cleft palate formation. The growth factor plays vital roles in embryogenesis. Mutations
in several WNT growth factors have been associated with human cleft palate defect. This
proposal studies the role of Wnt signaling in the regulation of the palate development and
attempts to establish molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Wnt5a and its receptors
during palatogenesis. The results obtained from this study will provide fundamental information
for our understanding of cleft palate formation in humans, and provide an insight for the genetic
prevention and therapy of the human cleft palate.","NIDCR","7727302","6/23/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01DE014044-07A1","2","R01","DE","014044","07","A","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","1/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1888311","CHEN, YIPING ","Not Applicable","01","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","US","29.935453","-90.123916","8424601","TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA","NEW ORLEANS","LA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","701185665","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","353875",

Project Narrative
Colonization of natural and synthetic biomaterials by bacteria elicits a cascade of local tissue reactions that
ultimately lead to loss of the supportive structures. Such tissue destruction is at the heart of many conditions,
including infected teeth, bones, dental implants, and joint implants. This project will develop multifunctional,
unitary, controlled release devices that halt the detrimental processes and stimulate localized tissue repair in
sites compromised by bacteria.","NIDCR","7633557","5/29/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-279","1R01DE019645-01","1","R01","DE","019645","01"," ","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","1874927","PULEO, DAVID A.","Not Applicable","06","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","939017877","H1HYA8Z1NTM5","939017877","H1HYA8Z1NTM5","US","38.042307","-84.458748","2793601","UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY","LEXINGTON","KY","GRADUATE SCHOOLS","405260001","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","394049",

Narrative
Cleft palate represents one of the most common congenital birth defects in the human population. Despite
recent advancements in medical intervention, babies born with cleft palate often suffer multiple handicaps
that significantly compromise the quality of their lives. Significantly, mutations in the Transforming Growth
Factor-� (TGF-�) gene cause cleft palate in humans and mice. This research program is designed to
further our understanding of how aberrant TGF-� signaling may adversely affect cell fate determination
during palatogenesis and causes cleft palate. Ultimately, this investigation will provide important
information for the future prevention and treatment of craniofacial birth defects.","NIDCR","7785121","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R37DE012711-11A1","2","R37","DE","012711","11","A","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","1/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","6378298","CHAI, YANG ","Not Applicable","37","DENTISTRY","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","US","34.065915","-118.196446","7636101","UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA","Los Angeles","CA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","900894304","UNITED STATES","N","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","407084",

HIV1-infected individuals are surviving longer but continue to suffer from a variety of
vascular diseases which can lead to conditions such as heart attack, stroke, and
respiratory failure. Vascular cells can be targets for viral products such as the HIV1
protein Tat. In this grant, we propose to investigate the molecular signaling pathways
engaged by this viral protein in human vascular cells, in order to reveal opportunities for
intervention against AIDS vasculopathies.","NHLBI","7912020","8/12/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R56HL061897-12A1","2","R56","HL","061897","12","A","COLOMBINI-HATCH, SANDRA","9/30/1998 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","NeuroAIDS and other End-Organ Diseases Study Section[NAED]"," ","1882818","TERADA, LANCE S","Not Applicable","30","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","800771545","YZJ6DKPM4W63","800771545","YZJ6DKPM4W63","US","32.814772","-96.841146","578404","UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER","DALLAS","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","753909105","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","OD"," "," "," ","353250",

NARRATIVE:
The long-term objective of this proposal is to obtain a better understanding of the
molecular mechanisms governing the first step in tumor cell dissemination, namely
motility. To accomplish this we propose to define the structure-functional relationship

PROJECT NARRATIVE
This grant proposal aims to expand our understanding of stromal responses to cancer and, by finding new
genes and pathways involved in this response, identify new targets for tumor microenvironment-targeted
therapy. In addition to their use as prognostic markers, we believe that potential therapeutic targets may also
be discovered in the group of genes, especially those involved in ""cross-talk"" between cancer and stromal
cells. The fact that different carcinomas share expression of these targets would mean that large groups of
patients suffering from a variety of tumors could benefit.","NCI","7583346","1/9/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA129927-01A2","1","R01","CA","129927","01","A","LIVELY, TRACY LUGO","1/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","8748247","WEST, ROBERT B","Not Applicable","18","Unavailable","624218814","H58TR2D7DNE3","624218814","H58TR2D7DNE3","US","37.40457","-122.145003","2357101","PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH","PALO ALTO","CA","Research Institutes","943041207","UNITED STATES","N","1/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","394","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","318219",

Title: Regeneration of Clinically Relevant Orofacial Tissues in Pre-Clinical Models
Project Narrative
We take advantage of the GO grant mechanism to assemble an existing critical mass of
well established scientists and multi-disciplinary surgeons into a consortium to regenerate
dental pulp-dentin grafts and facial soft tissue-bone grafts in a pre-clinical, large animal
model. With assistance of a FDA consultant who has previously worked with the PIs, we will
plan for first-in-human clinical trials on dental pulp-dentin grafts and facial soft tissue-bone
grafts in the present GO grant.","NIDCR","7854764","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-004","1RC2DE020767-01","1","RC2","DE","020767","01"," ","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","ZDE1-VH(37)"," ","1866984","MAO, JEREMY J","Not Applicable","13","DENTISTRY","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","US","40.841253","-73.940404","1833205","COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","100323725","UNITED STATES","N","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","1009678",

Project Narrative
 This proposal is focused on defining the etiology of human cerebellar malformations - common birth
defects of the brain affecting 1/5000 births, associated with mental retardation and motor deficits. Inadequate
knowledge regarding these malformations often results in mistaken diagnosis and inaccurate counseling
regarding prognosis, management and the genetic recurrence risks. An improved understanding of the
developmental and genetic causes will provide valuable diagnostic and prognostic information that will greatly

 Project Narrative
 We found that the EMT transcription factor, Slug, is upregulated in tumors and metastases in which N-
cadherin is upregulated. We believe that N-cadherin signaling through the FGF receptor induces a cascade of
events that leads to Slug induction, extravasation and metastasis. We will rule out the role of N-cadherin
adhesion in this process. We believe these studies will broaden our understanding of mechanisms that
regulate breast cancer metastasis and will provide insights into therapeutic application.","NCI","7650958","2/26/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA135061-01A1","1","R01","CA","135061","01","A","MOHLA, SURESH","3/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section[TCB]"," ","2268252","HAZAN, RACHEL B","Not Applicable","14","PATHOLOGY","110521739"," ","110521739"," ","US","40.851026","-73.844361","9433501","ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","BRONX","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","104611900","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","344450",

Narrative
 Congenital heart disease is the leading non-infectious cause of morbidity and
mortality among infants. Over the past two decades, studies in model organisms have
greatly advanced our understanding of the genetic causes of congenital heart disease.
However, it has not been possible to directly study the effect of gene mutations on
human heart development. Recent advances in production of pluripotent cells from skin
cells of patients allows us for the first time to overcome this hurdle and directly
investigate the effect of gene mutations on human heart development. In this proposal,
we study the effect of 22q11 deletion, the most common chromosomal microdeletion
associated with congenital heart disease, on cardiac differentiation and gene expression
in progenitor cells derived from patients with 22q11 deletion and tetralogy of Fallot.

Project Narrative
Our lab has been leading the study of KLF8 and has made major contributions to advancing this field of
research. Our identification of KLF8 as an inducer of EMT and invasion and a regulator of E-cad and MMPs is
significant as KLF8 represents a novel family of EMT-inducing transcription factors. Completion of this study
will further advance this field by shedding new light on mechanisms responsible for breast cancer metastasis
and providing new targets for novel therapeutic designs.","NCI","7737433","7/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA132977-01A2","1","R01","CA","132977","01","A","SNYDERWINE, ELIZABETH G","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","7752181","ZHAO, JIHE ","Not Applicable","20","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","190592162","G6VVMPNK4Y48","190592162","G6VVMPNK4Y48","US","42.653127","-73.774154","8455007","ALBANY MEDICAL COLLEGE","ALBANY","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","122083479","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","290359",

RELEVANCE
No single experimental mammalian species can completely simulate the human. Therefore, we are using
both a mouse model, Min, and a rat model, Pirc, to seek histological and molecular signatures conserved
across mammalian species that can discriminate between early tumors that will grow and progress versus
those that spontaneously arrest or even regress. A cohort of patients whose colonic neoplasms are being
followed longitudinally by CT colonography provides a resource to test the relevance to human colon cancer
of diagnostic and prognostic signatures discovered by controlled studies in these two animal models.","NCI","7737543","6/5/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01CA063677-15A2","2","R01","CA","063677","15","A","MIETZ, JUDY","9/22/1993 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Genetics Study Section[CG]"," ","1880473","DOVE, WILLIAM FRANKLIN","Not Applicable","02","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","161202122","LCLSJAGTNZQ7","161202122","LCLSJAGTNZQ7","US","43.068377","-89.40086","578503","UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON","MADISON","WI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","537151218","UNITED STATES","N","6/5/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","367370",

Project Narrative: One particular surprise from the last decade of developmental biology research is
that complex developmental processes in diverse tissues depend on just a few cell signaling pathways.
The hedgehog pathway plays a vital role at many steps in development and homeostasis of the
digestive tract and is also implicated in cancers of endodermally derived tissues. The functions and
mechanisms of hedgehog signaling in gut development are poorly understood, in spite of their useful
implications and applications for human gastrointestinal disorders. This proposal seeks to apply genetic

Project Narrative:
SnoN is a potent negative regulator of transforming growth factor-� (TGF-�) signaling,
which play important but complex roles during mammalian tumurigenesis. It regulates
many aspects of cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, senescence and
motility and contains both oncogenic and anti-oncogenic activities. Identification of the
signaling pathways mediating each of these activities and deciphering the specificity of
these pathways are crucial not only for understanding the mechanisms controlling
malignant progression but also for development of novel cancer therapy that specifically
targets the oncogenic activity of SnoN while preserving its anti-oncogenic activity.","NCI","7663652","7/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01CA087940-06A2","2","R01","CA","087940","06","A","SALNIKOW, KONSTANTIN","7/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Molecular Oncogenesis Study Section[MONC]"," ","1897773","LUO, KUNXIN ","Not Applicable","13","BIOCHEMISTRY","124726725","GS3YEVSS12N6","124726725","GS3YEVSS12N6","US","37.870295","-122.268133","577502","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY","BERKELEY","CA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","947101749","UNITED STATES","N","7/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","236113",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The sense of taste is life-essential, in directing identification and ingestion or rejection of nutrients. Taste
buds reside, in the tongue, in taste papillae which are complex sensory organs. Thus developing papillae
contain cell and molecular information that ultimately determines taste bud formation. To understand the
developmental origins of nutrient selection, and the extent to which genetic makeup or early food
experience can determine food preferences and aversions, basic knowledge is needed about how the taste
papilla sense organs develop. It is necessary to know what periods of papilla development are rigidly
determined and what periods are vulnerable to influence from substances that cross the placenta after
maternal ingestion or access. Understanding the basic developmental biology of taste papillae also will
provide insight into formation of taste bud-sensory nerve interactions that set up the neural circuits for taste
sensation.","NIDCD","7729829","6/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01DC000456-21A1","2","R01","DC","000456","21","A","DAVIS, BARRY","2/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-IFCN-E(02)M]"," ","1861897","MISTRETTA, CHARLOTTE M","Not Applicable","12","DENTISTRY","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","US","42.244005","-83.73915","1506502","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR","ANN ARBOR","MI","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","481091276","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","173","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCD"," "," "," ","327154",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States, and it is
responsible for the deaths of 16,000 women each year. Our group is developing a novel approach to treat
ovarian cancer by using measles virus strains that preferentially replicate in ovarian tumors. Based on
promising data deriving from a phase I trial of the MV-CEA measles strain in recurrent ovarian cancer patients,
in this application we seek to optimize delivery of the virus and weaken the immune response against the virus
in order to increase the efficacy of the treatment. Furthermore, we test the potential of the viral strain MV-NIS,
which allows imaging of the viral replication in the human body and use of radioactive iodine to augment the
therapeutic effect.","NCI","7727772","5/13/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA136547-01A1","1","R01","CA","136547","01","A","SONG, MIN-KYUNG H","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Developmental Therapeutics Study Section[DT]"," ","6107734","GALANIS, EVANTHIA ","PENG, KAH-WHYE ","01","Unavailable","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","US","44.022374","-92.465881","4976101","MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER","ROCHESTER","MN","Other Domestic Non-Profits","559050001","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","529522",

Project Narrative:
This BRP application will use a Multi-Functional Tissue Engineering Strategy to better repair tendon injuries.
Tendon and ligament injuries represent almost 45% of all musculoskeletal injuries and dramatically affect
quality of life in both recreational and workplace settings. We seek to identify genes expressed during tendon
development, and to use these data to control the generation of ""tissue engineered constructs,"" made in
culture, with the goal of using these to repair damaged tendons in small and large animal models and in the

Narrative
The poor prognosis for pancreatic cancer drives our effort to develop new therapeutic modalities.
More potent and safer CRAds can be fashioned into a clinically effective therapeutics. Also,
detailed analyses of CRAd functionality in clinically relevant models will provide the crucial
information required to advance vector design. The outcome of this project will lead to a
clinically usable therapeutics for pancreatic cancer.","NCI","7735927","6/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01CA094084-06A2","2","R01","CA","094084","06","A","ARYA, SURESH","3/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Developmental Therapeutics Study Section[DT]"," ","7066184","YAMAMOTO, MASATO ","Not Applicable","05","SURGERY","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","US","44.974119","-93.227014","1450402","UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA","MINNEAPOLIS","MN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","554552070","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","307285",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Asthma is a common disease, affecting ~7% of the adult US population, but not all asthma is the same. This
project is directly relevant to public health in that it will establish methods to identify the different types of
asthma and help target specific asthma therapies to the patients who will benefit from them the most. In
addition, these ""genome-wide"" studies, combined with cell culture studies, have the potential to identify
unsuspected causes of asthma that could be targets for new therapies directed at inflammation, airway
remodeling and steroid-resistance in asthma.","NHLBI","7691781","7/27/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-08-006","5R01HL095372-02","5","R01","HL","095372","02"," ","GAN, WEINIU","9/24/2008 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-K(S1)"," ","2053807","WOODRUFF, PRESCOTT G","Not Applicable","12","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","US","37.78689","-122.448998","577508","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO","SAN FRANCISCO","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","941432510","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","748530",

play in failure of normal skeletal growth, resulting in short stature.","NIAMS","7577207","7/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01AR048214-06A2","2","R01","AR","048214","06","A","TYREE, BERNADETTE","7/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1898989","ADAMS, SHERRILL L.","Not Applicable","03","BIOCHEMISTRY","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","US","39.952982","-75.192768","6463801","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","191046205","UNITED STATES","N","7/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","352780",

These regimens will target not only malignant epithelial cells of the tumor, but also the surrounding stromal cells that secrete factors favorable for tumor development. We have found that the stromal myofibroblasts are the source of prostaglandin E2, the target of chemopreventative non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Colorectal cancer cells are also dependent upon the Wnt signal transduction pathway for survival. We will test the hypothesis that NSAIDs, combined with inhibitors of Wnt signaling will be an effective treatment for colorectal cancer using rodent models.","NCI","7581658","5/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA127229-01A2","1","R01","CA","127229","01","A","MOHLA, SURESH","5/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","Developmental Therapeutics Study Section[DT]"," ","8220063","POWELL, DON WATSON","Not Applicable","14","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","800771149","MSPWVMXXMN76","800771149","MSPWVMXXMN76","US","29.243715","-94.856994","578406","UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON","GALVESTON","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","775555302","UNITED STATES","N","5/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","307560",

Sunlight induces both acute skin damage (sunburn) and long term skin damage (skin cancer). The role of the
Slug transcription factor in promoting skin cancer development has been documented, and we have
preliminary data suggesting an unexpected but important role for Slug in modulating sunburn. These studies
will investigate the mechanism by which Slug controls the inflammation associated with sunburn; this may
identify Slug as a target for prevention and treatment of both sunburn and, ultimately, skin cancer.","NIAMS","7689290","6/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","5R21AR054361-02","5","R21","AR","054361","02"," ","CIBOTTI, RICARDO","9/15/2008 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-H(02)S]"," ","6182419","KUSEWITT, DONNA FRANCES","Not Applicable","09","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","OVERALL MEDICAL","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","203280",

Project Narrative
FGF signaling has been implicated in craniosynostosis syndromes. In addition, mutations in the
molecules in the ERK MAPK pathway have been identified in a number of skeletal syndromes.
This study identifies novel regulatory mechanisms of bone formation by FGF and the ERK
MAPK pathway. The identification of the regulatory mechanisms will provide much needed
information for controlling bone formation in various skeletal disorders such as craniosynostosis.","NIDCR","7706640","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-07-418","1R03DE019814-01","1","R03","DE","019814","01"," ","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","NIDCR Special Grants Review Committee[DSR]"," ","8049309","MURAKAMI, SHUNICHI ","Not Applicable","11","ORTHOPEDICS","077758407","HJMKEF7EJW69","077758407","HJMKEF7EJW69","US","41.505076","-81.609998","218601","CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY","CLEVELAND","OH","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","441061712","UNITED STATES","N","9/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","117750",

Project Narrative 
Cataracts are the most prevalent form of blindness worldwide.  In the USA, cataract removal is 
the most common outpatient surgical operation performed on the elderly costing over 343 
million dollars in 2005 (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicareMedicaidStatSupp/).  However, 10-
20% of elderly and nearly 100% of pediatric patients treated for cataract develop posterior 
capsular opacification (PCO) which requires additional treatments and can result in reduced 
visual outcomes.  Further, much effort is being exerted towards the development of intraocular 
lens (IOLs) implants that restore the ability of the eye to accommodate (establish near focus) 
after cataract surgery.  A major impediment to long term restoration of accommodation is that 
lens epithelial cells trapped at the lens equator by the IOL often regenerate the lens cortex which 
reduces the ability of the ciliary muscles to accommodate the implanted IOL.  This proposal 
addresses unanswered questions related to the molecular mechanisms of PCO development 
and lens fiber cell differentiation with the long term goal of preventing the side effects of 
cataract surgery.

 Airway injury, manifested primarily by asthma, is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United
States. Diagnosis and management remain challenging due to the chronic repetitive nature of the disease that
leads to tissue remodeling. The proposal seeks to understand the link between the biological mechanisms that
trigger changes in the mechanical and optical properties in the airway mucosa. The results should provide a
platform for drug discovery and non-invasive diagnostics.","NHLBI","7736322","7/24/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01HL067954-06A2","2","R01","HL","067954","06","A","NOEL, PATRICIA","8/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Lung Cellular, Molecular, and Immunobiology Study Section[LCMI]"," ","1912012","GEORGE, STEVEN CARL","Not Applicable","45","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","046705849","MJC5FCYQTPE6","046705849","MJC5FCYQTPE6","US","33.678042","-117.773718","577504","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE","IRVINE","CA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","926970001","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","406933",

The cortex, or outer region, of the adrenal gland produces steroid hormones throughout life; if hormone
production is disrupted due to genetic mutation, as occurs in about 1:15000 people, it is lethal without lifelong
daily hormone replacement therapy. This project will study the molecular mechanisms that maintain the cells
in the adrenal cortex that produce steroids. Greater understanding of these mechanisms may lead to improved
management of adrenal disorders and ultimately perhaps ways to treat patients by gene repair and cell

Project Narrative
Short bowel syndrome is an important cause of morbidity, mortality and health care
costs in the United States. Identification of therapies that enhance residual small bowel
function and ultimately encourage growth of new intestine are needed for treatment of
short bowel syndrome, regardless of the underlying etiology (e.g. from Crohn's disease
following resection, post-trauma, or vascular injury). The significance of our proposed
studies to health is that we have identified novel pathways that regulate the ability of the
intestine to grow and absorb nutrients. We have found that pathways regulated by tis7,
a gene that regulates transcription of other genes, can promote intestinal growth and
nutrient absorption and calorie storage. These observations may provide avenues for
new therapies to enhance functional and regenerative adaptation following loss of
functional small bowel surface area","NIDDK","7754844","6/3/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-010","2R01DK046122-13A1","2","R01","DK","046122","13","A","CARRINGTON, JILL L","9/18/1995 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-DKUS-F(02)M]"," ","1859991","RUBIN, DEBORAH C.","Not Applicable","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","US","38.647241","-90.300814","9083901","WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY","SAINT LOUIS","MO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","631304862","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDDK"," "," "," ","364800",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The proposed studies are aimed at understanding at a molecular level how the renal epithelial cell tight
junction barrier is formed. The public health significance is that loss of the barrier leads to acute renal
failure such as is common following ischemic and toxic injury. The findings will guide strategies to preserve
and restore the tubular barrier when injured.","NIDDK","7730282","8/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01DK061397-06A2","2","R01","DK","061397","06","A","MAY, MICHAEL K","4/21/2003 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Cellular and Molecular Biology of the Kidney Study Section[CMBK]"," ","7365137","ANDERSON, JAMES M.","Not Applicable","04","PHYSIOLOGY","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","US","35.926939","-79.038605","578206","UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL","CHAPEL HILL","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","275995023","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDDK"," "," "," ","530906",

The project aims to enhance our molecular and functional understanding of integrin-linked kinase-PINCH-
parvin (IPP) complex. This complex is essential for embryonic development, tissue maintenance and repair,
host defense and hemostasis. We will determine crystal structures, conduct functional studies and describe
the effects of mutations in cells. The proposed studies will help us understand how the IPP complex mediates
its critical cellular roles.","NIGMS","7696817","8/13/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01GM088240-01","1","R01","GM","088240","01"," ","FLICKER, PAULA F","8/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Intercellular Interactions Study Section[ICI]"," ","7345529","CALDERWOOD, DAVID A","BOGGON, TITUS JONATHON","03","PHARMACOLOGY","043207562","FL6GV84CKN57","043207562","FL6GV84CKN57","US","41.303164","-72.931644","9420201","YALE UNIVERSITY","NEW HAVEN","CT","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","065208327","UNITED STATES","N","8/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIGMS"," "," "," ","347550",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
 The dissemination of tumor cells to distant organs, or metastasis, is a deadly occurrence in cancer
progression, but its underlying mechanisms are still largely obscure. The present proposal will dissect a novel
pathway of metastasis, involving interplay between regulators of cell survival and cell adhesion. The results

The grant is resubmitted in response to PAR-06-198 ""NINDS Exploratory / Developmental Projects in
Translational Research"". This R21 proposal rests on the hypothesis that adipose derived stem cells (ASC)
have the potential to serve as a cell therapeutic expressing GALC for Krabbe's disease without the
complicating destructive consequences of hematopoietic stem cell therapy. This proposal constitutes the initial
proof of concept step in a comprehensive translational and regenerative medical strategy. Specifically, murine
studies will serve as the first step in this process. Subsequent proof of principle studies in a nonhuman primate
model will allow the analysis of our novel therapeutic interventions by permitting multiple biopsies, MRI
analysis of animals and unique avenues, such as the ability to perform both cognitive and behavioral testing,
that cannot be done in lower order animal models.","NINDS","7912741","9/24/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-06-189","3R21NS059665-01A2S1","3","R21","NS","059665","01","A2S","TAGLE, DANILO A","9/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Neurological Sciences and Disorders B Study Section[NSD-B]"," ","1944817","BUNNELL, BRUCE A.","Not Applicable","01","PHARMACOLOGY","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","US","29.935453","-90.123916","8424601","TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA","NEW ORLEANS","LA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","701185665","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NINDS"," "," "," ","93125",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Asthma is a common disease, affecting ~7% of the adult US population, but not all asthma is the same. This
project is directly relevant to public health in that it will establish methods to identify the different types of
asthma and help target specific asthma therapies to the patients who will benefit from them the most. In
addition, these ""genome-wide"" studies, combined with cell culture studies, have the potential to identify
unsuspected causes of asthma that could be targets for new therapies directed at inflammation, airway
remodeling and steroid-resistance in asthma.","NHLBI","7842150","7/16/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-08-006","3R01HL095372-01S1","3","R01","HL","095372","01","S","GAN, WEINIU","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-K(S1)"," ","2053807","WOODRUFF, PRESCOTT G","Not Applicable","12","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","US","37.78689","-122.448998","577508","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO","SAN FRANCISCO","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","941432510","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","147546",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
)
Chronic kidney disease is a public health epidemic that affects millions yet despite the
regenerative capacity of the kidney, many people with chronic kidney disease suffer
progressive loss of function. Emerging evidence from different disciplines indicates that
loss of the small blood vessels, known as capillaries that carry oxygen and nutrients to
the tubules of the kidney, may be a central problem in chronic kidney disease. We have
recently discovered that kidney capillaries comprising endothelial cells are also
wrapped in another type of cell called pericytes. Until now pericytes in the kidney have
been poorly described and their function in the kidney has not been studied. We have
developed unique tools to study pericytes in mice, and in this proposal we will
investigate at a cellular and molecular level the role pericytes play in the developing
vasculature, maintenance of healthy vasculature and in vascular regeneration following
injury of the kidney. )

 Project Narrative
 We found that R-cadherin is substantially downregulated in breast cancer. We have established a
series of in vitro and in vivo models to test tumor suppression by R-cadherin. Interestingly, R-cadherin and N-
cadherin are structurally very similar, yet display opposite effects on tumor progression. We have designed a
series of studies to study the role of R-cadherin loss in breast cancer progression and map the molecular
determinants that mediate its suppressive function as opposed to those that mediate tumor invasion by N-
cadherin. We believe these studies have the potential to broaden our understanding of mechanisms that
regulate breast cancer progression and have thus the potential to provide insights into therapeutic application.","NCI","7737394","7/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA136854-01A1","1","R01","CA","136854","01","A","LIVELY, TRACY LUGO","7/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","2268252","HAZAN, RACHEL B","Not Applicable","14","PATHOLOGY","110521739"," ","110521739"," ","US","40.851026","-73.844361","9433501","ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","BRONX","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","104611900","UNITED STATES","N","7/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","394","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","344450",

The grant is resubmitted in response to PAR-06-198 ""NINDS Exploratory / Developmental Projects in
Translational Research"". This R21 proposal rests on the hypothesis that adipose derived stem cells (ASC)
have the potential to serve as a cell therapeutic expressing GALC for Krabbe's disease without the
complicating destructive consequences of hematopoietic stem cell therapy. This proposal constitutes the initial
proof of concept step in a comprehensive translational and regenerative medical strategy. Specifically, murine
studies will serve as the first step in this process. Subsequent proof of principle studies in a nonhuman primate
model will allow the analysis of our novel therapeutic interventions by permitting multiple biopsies, MRI
analysis of animals and unique avenues, such as the ability to perform both cognitive and behavioral testing,
that cannot be done in lower order animal models.","NINDS","7675940","8/11/2009 12:00:00 AM","PAR-06-189","5R21NS059665-02","5","R21","NS","059665","02"," ","TAGLE, DANILO A","9/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Neurological Sciences and Disorders B Study Section[NSD-B]"," ","1944817","BUNNELL, BRUCE A.","Not Applicable","01","PHARMACOLOGY","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","US","29.935453","-90.123916","8424601","TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA","NEW ORLEANS","LA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","701185665","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","853","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NINDS"," "," "," ","161881",

NARRATIVE STATEMENT
T lymphocytes are cells of the immune system that control the body's response to infection. The
thymus makes T lymphocytes in early life, but production of T lymphocytes profoundly decreases
during aging. The studies will examine how embryonic stem cells can be used to generate thymic

Narrative
This proposal will test novel mechanisms of disease explaining how infection and inflammation disrupt normal
lung development and immune function in preterm infants. These processes contribute to the pathogenesis of
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease that affects up to 10,000 former preterm children each
year in the United States.","NHLBI","7714516","9/14/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-08-009","1R01HL097195-01","1","R01","HL","097195","01"," ","BLAISDELL, CAROL J","9/14/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-H(M2)"," ","7598551","PRINCE, LAWRENCE S","BLACKWELL, TIMOTHY S.","05","PEDIATRICS","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","US","36.140134","-86.796274","8721001","VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY","Nashville","TN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","372032408","UNITED STATES","N","9/14/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","542498",

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, lethal interstitial lung disease. The sentinel morphological
lesion is the fibroblastic focus, which is composed of fibroblasts embedded in a type I collagen rich matrix.
Seminal studies have demonstrated that polymerized type I collagen acts as a negative regulator of fibroblast
proliferation. We have discovered that IPF fibroblasts have escaped this restraint. Our mechanistic studies of
this phenomenon point to aberrant proliferation signaling through the �1 integrin, involving the downstream
phosphoinositol 3-kinase/Akt - PTEN axis. The objective of this grant application is to characterize the
molecular mechanism by which �1 integrin-collagen interaction results in abnormal proliferative signaling in IPF
fibroblasts. It is our goal to uncover those components of the myofibroblast cellular machinery that result in
unrelenting fibrosis in IPF, and in proper tissue healing under normal circumstances. Identifying key regulatory
nodes controlling the pathologic behavior of IPF fibroblasts may provide molecular therapeutic targets to limit
the progressive fibrosis that characterizes IPF.","NHLBI","7647573","9/4/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01HL089228-01A2","1","R01","HL","089228","01","A","REYNOLDS, HERBERT Y","9/4/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-RES-B(02)M]"," ","1903478","HENKE, CRAIG A","Not Applicable","05","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","US","44.974119","-93.227014","1450402","UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA","MINNEAPOLIS","MN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","554552070","UNITED STATES","N","9/4/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","163705",

Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a devastating, incurable disease of the heart that
can run in families. Patients suffer very severe arrhythmias and are at great risk of sudden death at a young
age. As the disease progresses, the heart muscle weakens and becomes replaced with fatty and fibroid
tissue, to the point where the heart is unable to pump blood. In the terminal stages (often in young adults),
heart transplant becomes the only alternative. Here, we propose that part of the origins of the disease may
involve a particular type of stem cells, which may produce excess fatty and fibroid cells. To understand the
role of these stem cells in ARVC, and potentially manipulate their function to preserve the heart wall, are the
main goals of this grant.","NHLBI","7825971","9/21/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-OD-09-003","1RC1HL100111-01","1","RC1","HL","100111","01"," ","PRZYWARA, DENNIS","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CVRS-B(58)R]"," ","1857690","DELMAR, MARIO ","TAFFET, STEVEN M; VIKSTROM, KAREN L","12","NONE","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","US","42.244005","-83.73915","1506502","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR","ANN ARBOR","MI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","481091276","UNITED STATES","N","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","500000",

Project Narrative:
Our goals are to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Hirschsprung's disease and to
devise a method to provide functional innervation to the region of aganglionic colon.
These studies will benefit patients with Hirchsprung's disease and other gastrointestinal
motility disorders because providing functional innervation is a superior alternative to
surgical excision, which leaves patient with lifelonggastrointestinal problems. The
information gained here will also be relevant to transplantation of other tissues including
neurons.

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The goal of this research is to test the Smad3 inhibitors for potential ophthalmic
applications to treat fibrosis, neovascularizaiton and KE-related corneal
dystrophies. Expression of fibrosis- and angiogenesis-related genes will be
analyzed biochemically and by immunostainings in corneal explant cultures and
animal models. Our results will provide insights for developing new treatments for
these ocular conditions.","NEI","7638313","7/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","1R21EY019552-01","1","R21","EY","019552","01"," ","SHEN, GRACE L","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Anterior Eye Disease Study Section[AED]"," ","8528790","YUAN, CHING ","Not Applicable","05","OPHTHALMOLOGY","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","US","44.974119","-93.227014","1450402","UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA","MINNEAPOLIS","MN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","554552070","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NEI"," "," "," ","188750",

Project Narrative:
Preclinical studies have suggested that many oral cancers are susceptible targets to herpes
oncolytic viral therapy. This proposal explores the specific mechanisms by which oral cancer cells
may naturally express higher levels of receptors to herpes envelope glycoproteins than normal
cells, permitting more selective infection and destruction of oral cancer cells. The results from this
proposal will (1) promote a new understanding of how herpes viruses target cancer cells, and (2)
identify tumor markers that can be used to predict response to herpes oncolytic therapy, and that
can be used to guide patient selection in upcoming clinical trials.","NIDCR","7659226","3/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","1R21DE019015-01A2","1","R21","DE","019015","01","A","SHIRAZI, YASAMAN","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Developmental Therapeutics Study Section[DT]"," ","2052781","WONG, RICHARD J","Not Applicable","12","Unavailable","064931884","KUKXRCZ6NZC2","064931884","KUKXRCZ6NZC2","US","40.764332","-73.955697","5079202","SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH","NEW YORK","NY","Research Institutes","100656007","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","284850",

Project Narrative
The development of a serious condition known as lung scarring (pulmonary fibrosis) is opposed by
two substances produced by the body, prostaglandin E2 and urokinase plasminogen activator. This
proposal will examine how these two substances act and interact to suppress scarring responses of
the key lung cell type known as the fibroblast. These studies will enhance our understanding of how
scarring responses are regulated, and may provide insight as to whether these substances could be
administered to patients to treat this devastating condition.","NHLBI","7728502","8/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01HL094311-01A1","1","R01","HL","094311","01","A","LINK, REBECCA P","8/11/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Lung Injury, Repair, and Remodeling Study Section[LIRR]"," ","1899275","PETERS-GOLDEN, MARC L","Not Applicable","12","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","US","42.244005","-83.73915","1506502","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR","ANN ARBOR","MI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","481091276","UNITED STATES","N","8/11/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","839","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","379710",

The mechanism of communicaiton between cells of the fruitfly Drosophila and humans is
well conserved and very similar. We make use of Drosophila to study how cell
communication affects cell movement. Lack of such communication can lead to severe

Cell movement is essential for normal processes such as embryonic development and tissue repair but it is
also a key factor in cancer progression, tissue fibrosis and several cardiovascular and neurodegenerative

Relevance to public health (lay language): TGF-� is a protein which can be either helpful or harmful to human
health. While its ability to stimulate cell growth is important for normal wound healing, when unchecked the
function of many organs can be disrupted by scar (i.e., fibrosis) formation. Conversely, the growth inhibitory
actions of TGF-� are critical in preventing cancer. The proposed studies will identify/characterize targets which
can be used to either increase or decrease these responses.","NIGMS","7649635","3/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R37GM055816-13","2","R37","GM","055816","13"," ","MARINO, PAMELA","5/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section[TCB]"," ","1893649","LEOF, EDWARD B","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","US","44.022374","-92.465881","4976101","MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER","ROCHESTER","MN","Other Domestic Non-Profits","559050001","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIGMS"," "," "," ","347530",

Project Narrative
Currently available intravital imaging techniques for observation of temporal and spatial
interactions of multiple immune cell types with tumors using traditional fluorophores are
limited by difficulties in concomitantly imaging multiple colors. We propose to solve this
problem by developing and optimizing infusion protocols in mice using novel
nanocrystal-antibody complexes, which should allow us to distinguish simultaneously
five or more specific probes by three-dimensional intravital multiphoton laser-scanning

Project Narrative-Relevance
Pancreatic cancer remains the one of the most lethal forms of human cancer, with a 5 year survival rate of
only 3-5%, due to its rapid metastatic spread as well as its resistance to standard chemotherapeutic regimens.
We show that pancreatic cell lines which display decreased levels of a protein called Disabled-2 exhibit the
characteristics of cells which are primed to undergo metastasis, suggesting that Dab2 plays a role in
suppression of pancreatic cancer. The studies proposed here will provide prelimary evidence to support a
role of Disabled-2 in prevention of pancreatic tumor progression and metastasis which may lead to improved
diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer.","NCI","7642712","4/3/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-314","1R03CA139313-01","1","R03","CA","139313","01"," ","WOODHOUSE, ELIZABETH","4/3/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-ONC-U(92)S]"," ","8664405","HOCEVAR, BARBARA A","Not Applicable","07","PHARMACOLOGY","603007902","SHHBRBAPSM35","603007902","SHHBRBAPSM35","US","39.780714","-86.174977","577806","INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS","INDIANAPOLIS","IN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","462022915","UNITED STATES","N","4/3/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","77000",

Project Narrative: The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is one of the major
symptoms of TMJ disorders that occur highly frequently humans. TMJ ankylosis is
clinically characterized by the formation of bone or fibrous adhesion of the joint
components, which restricts the jaw movement and causes difficulty in feeding,
swallowing, and breathing. Congenital TMJ ankylosis have been repored, but very little
is known about the underlying genetic alteractions. A conditional inactivation of the
homeobox gene Shox2 in the TMJ cells in mice leads to abnormal formation and
ankylosis of the TMJ. Thus the conditional Shox2 mutant mice provide a unique animal
model for studying TMJ development and TMJ ankylosis. This proposal studies the role
of Shox2 in the TMJ development and its functional mechanisms using in vitro and in
vivo approaches. The results obtained from this study will provide fundamental
information for our understanding of the formation and function of this unique joint in
humans.","NIDCR","7581991","11/17/2008 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01DE017792-01A2","1","R01","DE","017792","01","A","KUSIAK, JOHN W","1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1888311","CHEN, YIPING ","Not Applicable","01","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","US","29.935453","-90.123916","8424601","TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA","NEW ORLEANS","LA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","701185665","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2009 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","353875",

NARRATIVE
Failure to properly heal wounds results in significant morbidity and mortality in many patients, particularly
those with diabetes, neuropathies, trauma and even those just advanced in years. Incomplete wound
resolution predisposes to ulcers and skin disruption, while excessive repair results in scarring which impairs

Project Lay Narrative:
Arterial hardening in diabetes increases the risk for heart attacks & foot amputation. This

Narrative
The loss of transforming growth factor-ss (TGF-ss)-induced tumor suppressor function in tumors plays a pivotal
role in the transition from normal colorectal epithelium, to in situ carcinoma, and finally invasive and metastatic
cancers. We will investigate the mechanism of function of oncogenic STRAP and its crosstalk with Smad7 in
colorectal cancer progression and metastasis. A better understanding of these mechanisms will help to
improve drug development and treatment of this lethal disease.","NCI","7655877","2/26/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01CA095195-06A1","2","R01","CA","095195","06","A","AULT, GRACE S","5/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","6875894","DATTA, PRAN K","Not Applicable","05","SURGERY","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","US","36.140134","-86.796274","8721001","VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY","Nashville","TN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","372032408","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","250650",

Project Narrative
While the role of acquired DNA methylation in gene expression changes is of obvious importance,
methylation events can play additional roles in the clinical assessment of tumors, providing potential
biomarkers to assess the onset and progression of disease, risk states, monitor prevention strategies,
provide early diagnosis and to track the prognosis of cancer. Our new observations in the regulation of
epigenetic changes provide potential markers for assessing susceptibility to malignant transformation in
individuals, as well as, potential targets for prevention and therapy.","NCI","7725676","6/8/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01CA097214-06A1","2","R01","CA","097214","06","A","OKANO, PAUL","6/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Genetics Study Section[CG]"," ","1863933","TLSTY, THEA D","Not Applicable","12","PATHOLOGY","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","US","37.78689","-122.448998","577508","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO","SAN FRANCISCO","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","941432510","UNITED STATES","N","6/8/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","261802",

Muscularization of pulmonary arteries induced by an adaptive immune
response
Relevance:
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a devastating condition that can accompany chronic parasite
infections and auto-immune diseases. Thickening of the walls of pulmonary arteries by layers of
smooth muscle cells is one of the typical morphological alterations seen in PAH and this process is a
target for the development of new treatment strategies. The proposed studies are aimed at
delineating the cellular origin and mediators that cause the accumulation of these smooth muscle cells
in a mouse model of severe pulmonary arterial remodeling induced by the adaptive immune response.","NHLBI","7589219","5/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-181","1R21HL092370-01A2","1","R21","HL","092370","01","A","MOORE, TIMOTHY M","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Immunity and Host Defense Study Section[IHD]"," ","1945310","GRUNIG, GABRIELE ","Not Applicable","12","PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE","121911077","M5SZJ6VHUHN8","121911077","M5SZJ6VHUHN8","US","40.744985","-73.978118","5998304","NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","10016","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","180089",

Project Narrative
Half of all children with kidney failure are born with birth defects of the urinary tract, and
the most common of these are due to obstruction to urine flow. The timing and
indications for surgical intervention are unclear, and recovery is unpredictable. A new
animal (mouse) model is proposed to study the major cellular mechanisms for injury to
the newborn kidney, as well as to evaluate new therapies to enhance recovery.","NIDDK","7633522","8/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-059","1R01DK083372-01","1","R01","DK","083372","01"," ","HOSHIZAKI, DEBORAH K","8/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-RUS-F(51)S]"," ","1899284","CHEVALIER, ROBERT L.","Not Applicable","05","PEDIATRICS","065391526","JJG6HU8PA4S5","065391526","JJG6HU8PA4S5","US","38.034207","-78.512346","1526402","UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA","CHARLOTTESVILLE","VA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","229044195","UNITED STATES","N","8/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","701","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDDK"," "," "," ","346500",

Project Narrative MicroRNA in Human Ovarian Cancer
Ovarian carcinoma is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies. Its high death rate is a result
of the fact that most patients (~75%) are diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease. Despite an initial response
rate of 65%-80% to first-line chemotherapy, most ovarian carcinomas relapse. Acquired resistance to further
chemotherapy is generally responsible for treatment failure, resulting in an overall 5-year survival rate of only
about 25% for late-stage ovarian cancer. Thus, there is urgent need to develop tumor markers for early detection
and identify novel molecules that are responsible for chemoresistance and ovarian cancer development, and thus
lead to new targeted therapy. We have recently identified frequent alterations of a class small nucleotides,
called microRNAs, in human ovarian cancer. Some of these microRNAs are involved in chemoresistance and
drive ""normal"" cells to malignant behavior. We also detected microRNA in human ovarian cancer plasma.
Based on these preliminary results, we will investigate if the microRNAs could be diagnostic/prognostic markers,
therapeutic targets and causal factors in human ovarian cancer. These studies will have significant impact on
ovarian cancer detection and treatment.","NCI","7741279","5/18/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA137041-01A1","1","R01","CA","137041","01","A","ARYA, SURESH","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Basic Mechanisms  of Cancer Therapeutics Study Section[BMCT]"," ","2083857","CHENG, JIN Q","Not Applicable","14","Unavailable","139301956","DVHKP4N619V9","139301956","DVHKP4N619V9","US","28.062545","-82.419587","3736101","H.

The importance of nuclear receptor networks in bone marrow differentiation programs has been firmly
established and in our ongoing grant, AR54604, we identified several genetic polymorphisms in the PPAR�
gene which we identified as a key determinant of adipocyte and bone cell fate. We now propose to study
retinaldehyde and its effect on RXR which partners with PPAR�, to form an activated transcriptional complex
to regulate gene expression and ultimately to influence bone mass acquisition. A more comprehensive
understanding of the regulatory inputs that determine PPAR� responses in bone has important clinical
implications, particularly after the discovery that the thiazolidinediones, drugs that enhance insulin sensitivity

Project Narrative:
This is a competing renewal request for a project focused on identifying the role of Nf1 in
cardiovascular development and function. Our lab has shown that the gene causing
Neurofibromatosis, Nf1, functions in vascular endothelium and smooth muscle; and preliminary
data indicates that Nf1 is important in cardiac myocytes as well. We propose experiments to
elucidate the mechanism of Nf1 function in the cardiovascular system with implications for the
treatment of cardiovascular disorders in Neurofibromatosis, and for understanding of common
diseases such as hypertension and heart failure.","NHLBI","7587850","4/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01HL062974-10","2","R01","HL","062974","10"," ","SCHRAMM, CHARLENE A","7/8/1999 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Cardiovascular Differentiation and Development Study Section[CDD]"," ","1876674","EPSTEIN, JONATHAN A.","Not Applicable","03","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","US","39.952982","-75.192768","6463801","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","191046205","UNITED STATES","N","4/8/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","393750",

Project Narrative
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States, and metastasis is the
most common cause of death in lung cancer patients. New approaches are needed for the prevention of
metastasis in patients with lung cancer. Studies have shown that K-ras mutations are common in human lung
adenocarcinomas and are sufficient to initiate the development of lung adenocarcinomas in mice, but other
genetic events are required for the subsequent metastasis of these tumors. In this project, we will test the
hypothesis that inactivating mutations in MKK4, a gene that is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancer
types including lung cancer, promote the metastasis of K-ras-mutant lung cancer cells. We will examine
whether MKK4 inactivation causes these cells to develop the ""skills"" to metastasize, including the ability to
recruit inflammatory cells that promote cancer cell invasion and dissemination. If our findings support this
hypothesis, then clinical studies would be warranted to examine whether the presence of mutations in K-ras
and MKK4 together identify a subset of patients who are at high risk for metastasis and would benefit from
additional therapy to prevent disease recurrence.","NCI","7706419","6/16/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01CA105155-06A1","2","R01","CA","105155","06","A","SALNIKOW, KONSTANTIN","2/1/2004 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Molecular Oncogenesis Study Section[MONC]"," ","1869259","KURIE, JONATHAN M","Not Applicable","09","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","251447",

Project Narrative
The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2008 there will be more than 1.4 million new cases of cancer in
the United States which will claim the lives of more than 500,000 Americans, and the vast majority of these
cases will be solid tumors with the presence of overt metastases over the course of their disease. The goal of
this proposal is to develop a series of novel imaging radiopharmaceuticals targeting seprase, a protein that is
normally restricted to fetal expression and sites of wound healing, but is selectively overexpressed in cancer-
associated fibroblasts of greater than 90% of human primary epithelial tumors, making it an attractive target to
exploit for noninvasive imaging, as well as targeted radiotherapy. We believe that the seprase radiotracers
could be exploited for the diagnosis, staging, prognosis and potential treatment of patients with solid tumors
and metastases.","NCI","7748058","6/17/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-050","1R43CA141957-01","1","R43","CA","141957","01"," ","ANDALIBI, ALI","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","12/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-ONC-R(11)B]"," ","9177172","JOYAL, JOHN LOUIS","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","076298459"," ","076298459"," ","US","42.366759","-71.079488","4171101","MOLECULAR INSIGHT PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.","CAMBRIDGE","MA","Domestic For-Profits","021421515","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","12/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","395","SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","180916",

 Tumor vasculature represents a powerful new target of anti-cancer therapy. Novel targets of anti-
angiogenic therapy include molecules which are uniquely expressed on tumor endothelium and/or endothelial

 In 2006, some 1.8 million dental procedures in the U.S. made use of a regenerative tissue product or
an autograft harvested from the patient's mouth to treat serious tissue loss around teeth-with that number
projected to increase at a rate of 16% over the next five years. And although it is estimated that wound-
healant products are used in approximately 20% of all dental regenerative procedures, current-generation
products do not fully meet the needs of periodontists and oral surgeons-often producing inconsistent results
and/or proving to be very expensive (often prohibitively so). The goal of this multi-phase STTR project is to
develop, validate, and commercialize the needed next-generation wound-healant that periodontists and oral
surgeons can use to effectively and economically treat their patients who suffer from tissue degeneration that
leads to tooth loss and threatens oral health.","NIDCR","7671187","7/24/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-051","1R41DE019591-01A1","1","R41","DE","019591","01","A","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-K(11)B]"," ","2581224","ROEDERSHEIMER, MARK THOMAS","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","809756484","P7J3BLYNEM72","809756484","P7J3BLYNEM72","US","39.744141","-104.990693","10018590","SNOASIS MEDICAL, INC.","DENVER","CO","Domestic For-Profits","802024279","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","121","SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIDCR"," "," "," ","117550",

Project Narrative.
The gene modified tissue engineered models to be produced by the current project will
provide researchers in the pharmaceutical industry and academic research laboratories
a readily available means for studying the functional genomics of nearly any gene in
human epithelial cells, as well as crosstalk between epithelial and stromal cells in the
differentiated organotypic state. The models will be utilized to identify and validate
targets for the development of novel therapeutics for treatment of human skin and airway
epithelial diseases including cancers, chronic wounds, blistering diseases, scarring, and
airway remodeling associated with asthma and COPD.","NIGMS","7611928","2/12/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-050","1R43GM084551-01A1","1","R43","GM","084551","01","A","PORTNOY, MATTHEW","2/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/14/2011 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CB-D(10)B]"," ","6162712","HAYDEN, PATRICK J","Not Applicable","05","Unavailable","147365936","Q1V1JV6GJW77","147365936","Q1V1JV6GJW77","US","42.259803","-71.462423","2005301","MATTEK CORPORATION","ASHLAND","MA","Domestic For-Profits","017211717","UNITED STATES","N","2/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/14/2011 12:00:00 AM","859","SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIGMS"," "," "," ","221236",

Decreases in T cell immunity are a direct consequence of age-related thymic degeneration, and
are linked to a host of undesirable conditions, including increased risk of infection, increased
severity of infection, decreased response to vaccinations, decreased tumor surveillance,
increased autoimmunity, and so on. Regenerating the thymus is therefore of significant interest
to human health. This application proposes a novel approach to understanding the biology of
regrowth of the atrophied thymus. In addition to an in-depth understanding of the regrowth
process, this project is expected to ultimately reveal potential new targets for thymic

PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Soy isoflavones possess estrogenic properties, and reproductive tract tissues (including Leydig
cells) express ER� and ER�. Because proliferative activity in Leydig cells, which determines the
final number of Leydig cells, is restricted to the prepubertal period, modulation of Leydig cell mitosis in
the prepubertal period has consequences for Leydig cell numbers in the adult testis. The present
application is designed to identify the mechanisms by which soy isoflavones cause long-lasting
effects on testicular androgen secretion using the rat model.
 Experiments will be performed to address three Specific Aims: Soy isoflavones affect
mesenchymal Leydig cell precursors in the prenatal and/or neonatal period, which alters Leydig cell
proliferation and population (Aim I); Estrogen regulation of Leydig cell mitosis is mediated by
interaction of signaling pathways, which involves the cell survival factor protein Akt (protein kinase B)
acting in concert with estrogen receptor ER�, epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR), insulin
growth factor-1 receptors (IGF-1R) and mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) (Aim II); and,
Action of soy isoflavones in Sertoli cells affects Leydig cells (Aim III). Timed pregnant dams will be
fed diets containing low and high isoflavone levels (5, 1000 ppm) in the perinatal period. Male
offspring will be analyzed for Leydig cell proliferation in prepubertal and pubertal rats. In addition, the
number of Leydig cells will be enumerated by stereology in the adult testis at 90 days of age.
Analysis of genistein action regulating Leydig cell mitosis will involve use of pharmacological inhibition
and gene silencing techniques to investigate the role of Akt, ER�, EGFR and IGF1-R. The possibility
that soy isoflavones act directly in the seminiferous epithelium will be investigated by analysis of
Sertoli cell differentiation and maturation. In addition, Sertoli cell-Leydig cell interactions will be
evaluated by culture of Leydig cells in Sertoli cell-conditioned media.
 The proposed experiments will be the first to investigate the mechanisms of soy isoflavone
action in Leydig cells. In particular, the EDS- and busulfan-treated rat models provide opportunities to
study cell proliferation and cell-cell interactions in vivo. These models have contributed immensely to
our understanding of testicular biology but have not been used in toxicological studies. Also, the
hypothesis that estrogenic compounds, and perhaps other endocrine-active agents, may exert
indirect effects in Leydig cells by action exerted in Sertoli cells has not been explored. Together,
these approaches will yield information not previously described for phytoestrogen action in testicular
cells. The information will contribute to ongoing about potential reproductive toxicity of soy-based
diets especially in neonates.
 The growing public concern for agri-terrorism represents a challenge to veterinarians who have
responsibilities for defense of food supplies. Also, biomedical research is increasingly benefiting from
investigation conducted in food animal species, e.g., use of pigs to study obesity and diabetes and
dogs for cardiopulmonary diseases. Research training to be afforded by the present application to
professional veterinary students will contribute to efforts geared to preparing future veterinarians to
meet these challenges.","NIEHS","7721061","7/21/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-06-042","1R15ES015886-01A2","1","R15","ES","015886","01","A","SCHUG, THADDEUS","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Cellular, Molecular and Integrative Reproduction Study Section[CMIR]"," ","8147200","AKINGBEMI, BENSON TOKUNBO","Not Applicable","03","VETERINARY SCIENCES","066470972","DMQNDJDHTDG4","066470972","DMQNDJDHTDG4","US","32.635016","-86.809379","1470402","AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN","Auburn","AL","SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE","368325888","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","113","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIEHS"," "," "," ","219000",

PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE
Clinical trials have demonstrated that the effects of conventional and investigational cancer therapies are
remarkably heterogeneous, and efforts are currently underway to match therapies to the specific molecular
features associated with responsiveness to them in an effort to better exploit their effects (""personalized
medicine""). The overall goal of the research proposed here is to better understand the mechanisms involved in
cell killing induced by two promising classes of investigational cancer therapies (proteasome inhibitors and
histone deacetylase inhibitors) so that the promising effects of these drugs that have been noted in preclinical
models can be best exploited in patients. We will be directly comparing the effects of two proteasome inhibitors
and three HDAC inhibitors that are either already FDA-approved, being evaluated in clinical trials, or being
developed for clinical application in humans, and in our third Specific Aim we will develop and apply
pharmacodynamic assays to measure drug-target interactions and the biological consequences of effective
drug targeting within the context of a Phase II clinical trial in patients.","NCI","7590692","12/23/2008 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01CA127494-01A2","1","R01","CA","127494","01","A","SALNIKOW, KONSTANTIN","1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Basic Mechanisms  of Cancer Therapeutics Study Section[BMCT]"," ","1862151","MCCONKEY, DAVID J","Not Applicable","09","UROLOGY","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NCI"," "," "," ","255640",

Project Narrative
Osteoarthritis will affect 50 million Americans by 2020. The disease process is
characterized by the aberrant gene expression and the inability of cartilage chondrocytes
to repair the extracellular matrix leading to cartilage degeneration. CD-RAP is a small
cartilage-characteristic protein that is co-expressed in cartilage with type II collagen and
aggrecan. The current proposal will focus on analyses to define transcriptional
regulatory networks that predominantly operate in and define cartilage development (as

Project Narrative
Osteoarthritis will affect 50 million Americans by 2020. The disease process is
characterized by the aberrant gene expression and the inability of cartilage chondrocytes
to repair the extracellular matrix leading to cartilage degeneration. CD-RAP is a small
cartilage-characteristic protein that is co-expressed in cartilage with type II collagen and
aggrecan. The current proposal will focus on analyses to define transcriptional
regulatory networks that predominantly operate in and define cartilage development (as
opposed to the growth plate which results in bone formation), cartilage repair, and
osteoarthritis. As new transcription factors arise, specific mechanism of activity will be
deciphered using our CD-RAP and COL2A1 gene models.","NIAMS","7783335","9/28/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","2R01AR045550-11A1","2","R01","AR","045550","11","A","TYREE, BERNADETTE","3/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","1882196","SANDELL, LINDA J","Not Applicable","01","ORTHOPEDICS","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","US","38.647241","-90.300814","9083901","WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY","SAINT LOUIS","MO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","631304862","UNITED STATES","N","9/28/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NIAMS"," "," "," ","342000",

Project Narrative
 High blood pressure is major contributor to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The number of ESRD
patients treated by either dialysis or transplantation has more than doubled in the period from 1991 to 2004
from 209,000 to 472,000. In the next 20 years, the numbers of ESRD patients are expected to increase to
over 2 million. Additionally, the economic impact is substantial, burdening the Medicare system (costing
$20.1 billion or 7% percent of total Medicare expenditures), and the private insurance sector (estimated at
$12.1 billion). The unfortunate reality is that treatment options are limited and only slow the progression of
the disease. The focus of the proposed work is to identify genes that predispose the Dahl salt-sensitive (S)
rat to develop hypertension-induced kidney disease. Previous genetic analysis using the S rat identified
several chromosomal regions linked to kidney disease. In particular, a region on rat chromosome 2 was
found to play a significant role in the kidney injury observed in the S rat. The homologous region on human
chromosome 1q21 has also been linked to kidney disease in multiple studies. This underlies the importance
in identifying the gene in the rat because the findings may be readily applied to human kidney disease. In
summary, it is the goal of this proposal to utilize a rodent model of human disease and advanced genetic
techniques to expedite the identification of a gene involved in kidney disease. The application of knowledge
gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the how and why of the disease and
ultimately provide earlier and more effective treatments of the disease before kidney failure is reached.","NHLBI","7715407","8/4/2009 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","1R01HL094446-01A1","1","R01","HL","094446","01","A","THRASHER, TERRY N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/15/2010 12:00:00 AM","Hypertension and Microcirculation Study Section[HM]"," ","7888323","GARRETT, MICHAEL R","Not Applicable","05","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","937639060","E8VWJXMMUQ67","937639060","E8VWJXMMUQ67","US","43.04575","-88.020374","46001","MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN","MILWAUKEE","WI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","532263548","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/15/2010 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," ","NHLBI"," "," "," ","380000",

Project Narrative
This proposal will determine if the loss of activity of the nuclear receptor, PPAR, is the cause of permanent
hair loss in scarring alopecia. It will also determine whether the xenobiotic response receptor, AhR, has a role
in inhibiting PPAR. PPAR has broad-range effects in controlling inflammation and regulating lipid
metabolism. Because this nuclear receptor is important for normal hair follicle health, understanding its
regulatory mechanisms and target effectors provides a basis for targeted therapy in hair and cutaneous

Potential Impact on Veterans Health Care: Because knee ligament injuries which require surgical 
reconstruction are common in the VA patient population, this proposal has the potential to directly 
influence the lives of veterans and thereby enhance the quality of services provided by the VA. 
Although current methods for ACL reconstruction are successful at restoring stability to the knee, 
there are many side effects and risks to surgical reconstruction due primarily to the use of a graft 
which is needed to rebuild the injured ligament. In fact, many veterans with this injury are denied 
surgery for this problem and thus must decrease their physical activity level because the risk of 
morbidity from the graft harvest is not justified and there are not enough allografts currently 
available for everyone with this problem. At our VA institution alone, over 150 ACL reconstructions 
have been performed over the last 6 years. Thus, this proposal can improve the management of ACL 
injuries in veterans. In addition, basic methods of ligament and tendon tissue engineering developed 
in this study could be directly applied to other common clinical problems in which tendon or 
ligament tissue is absent or deficient. These problems include shoulder (rotator cuff) and knee 
(quadriceps and patellar) tendon ruptures, which are also common in the VA patient population. 
Furthermore, the results of this research could be applied to engineering of other connective tissues 
including other tendons, fascia, and skin. Thus, this proposal could ultimately result in substantial 
improvements in the quality of life of veterans.","VA","7681830","3/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-08-001","1I01BX000126-01","1","I01","BX","000126","01"," "," ","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","Surgery[SURG]"," ","9443104","MCALLISTER, DAVID ","Not Applicable","33","Unavailable","066689118","DL46AKJ5YD48","066689118","DL46AKJ5YD48","US","34.104809","-118.41105","481012","VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM","LOS ANGELES","CA","Independent Hospitals","900731003","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2010 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2009"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",
