The aims of this application are focused to better identification and characterization of adult mesenchymal
progenitor cells. Our study will evaluate their ability to differentiate into mature mesenchymal lineages in vitro
and in vivo and determine the diverging point at which mesenchymal progenitor cells commit to mature
lineages and factors that can modulate this commitment. The knowledge developed in this grant will provide
the foundation for future studies aimed at use of mesenchymal progenitor cells as therapeutic tools for
osteoporosis and genetic disorders of bone.","NIAMS","8214496","3/9/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01AR055607-02","5","R01","AR","055607","02"," ","WANG, FEI","2/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","8263348","KALAJZIC, IVO ","Not Applicable","05","DENTISTRY","022254226","H6D6JMXJXDE6","022254226","H6D6JMXJXDE6","US","41.733439","-72.797053","1506603","UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT","FARMINGTON","CT","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","060305335","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","225000","118867"," ","343867",

Successful repair requires the generation of stable bone/cartilage cells from implanted stem cells through the process of differentiation. This project will study the roles of small regulatory RNAs (microRNAs) in controlling the differentiation pathways of stem cells towards specific cell types. This should uncover novel mechanisms that can be exploited for therapeutic use in cartilage defect repair and fracture healing.

PROJECT NARRATIVE- PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT
 Non-union fractures remain a challenging clinical problem that affect approximately 600,000 people every
year in the United States. Because our elderly population is becoming larger, an increased incidence of non-
unions as consequence of poor healing and age-related worsening of osteoporosis is expected. Adult bone
marrow contains multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) that have all the properties to become a novel
therapeutic approach to treat non-unions. The overall goal of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms
through which MSC exert their beneficial effects in fracture repair. Unraveling how MSC are capable to
respond to the fracture regenerative clue and to provide the adequate environment for tissue regeneration will
provide critical insights to develop novel MSC-based therapies to treat patients with non-unions","NIDDK","8322801","7/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01DK070929-08","5","R01","DK","070929","08"," ","MALOZOWSKI, SAUL N","4/5/2006 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","8184497","SPAGNOLI, ANNA ","Not Applicable","04","PEDIATRICS","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","US","35.926939","-79.038605","578206","UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL","CHAPEL HILL","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","275995023","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","205425","98604"," ","304029",

In many cases, MM progresses from a more benign-like stage of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).  This grant focuses on understanding the role of specific regulators of genes called miRNA.  We will examine the role of two miRNAs, miR15a and 16-1 in the regulation of progression and dissemination in MM.  New drugs are being developed to target these miRNAs.  These new drugs will lead to a paradigm shift in the treatment of MM, where we could prevent disease progression to active MM, or revert MM to an MGUS-like stage.

MSCs are the cells that can give rise to the osteoblasts, the cells that make bone. Giving extra MSCs to patients with severe osteoporosis or delayed fracture healing would be a good therapeutic option. However, this approach was not successful due to the transplanted MSCs can not readily go to bone. Our research group has developed a novel method to guide the transplanted MSCs to bone by creating a compound with high affinity to both to the MSCs and bone. The goal of this project is to test whether we can build new bone in preclinical studies of bone loss using our lead compound, LLP2A-Ale alone, or in the combination of MSCs transplantation, to increase bone formation and if our approach has the potential to make more bones and stronger bones.

osteoblasts or the vasculature. Preliminary studies supporting this proposal suggest that
bona fide mesenchymal stem cells, peri-vascular and isolatable by Nestin expression,
form a unique HSC niche in the bone marrow. This proposal explores the function of this

Ewing sarcoma family tumors (ET) are highly aggressive bone and soft tissue tumors that primarily affect
children, adolescents, and young adults. Novel therapies are desperately needed, particularly for patients with
metastatic disease in whom survival is rare despite aggressive, multi-modality treatment. The studies outlined
in this proposal will offer new insights into the putative stem cell origins and underlying biology of these
aggressive tumor with a goal of identifying novel stem cell pathway targets that can be exploited for therapeutic
intervention.","NCI","8256673","4/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA134604-03","5","R01","CA","134604","03"," ","AULT, GRACE S","6/10/2010 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Molecular Oncogenesis Study Section[MONC]"," ","8554243","LAWLOR, ELIZABETH R","Not Applicable","12","PEDIATRICS","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","US","42.244005","-83.73915","1506502","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR","ANN ARBOR","MI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","481091276","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","111708"," ","312983",

The Role of miRNAs in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Metastasis
Project Narrative/Relevance
Over 90% of cancer related deaths are due to the metastatic spread of primary tumor cells to distant
vital organs. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the reverse process, MET, have been
postulated to be important processes for tumor cells to gain the ability to migrate and invade into their
surrounding tissue and to regain their epithelial phenotype to facilitate colonization once they reach
the target organs. This study will investigate how microRNAs, a novel class of genetic regulators,
regulate EMT and will provide some of the best evidence to date as to whether EMT can promote
early dissemination of tumor cells while MET may be essential for efficient colonization of distant
target organs.","NCI","8264374","3/20/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA141062-03","5","R01","CA","141062","03"," ","JHAPPAN, CHAMELLI","4/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","8327393","KANG, YIBIN ","Not Applicable","12","BIOCHEMISTRY","002484665","NJ1YPQXQG7U5","002484665","NJ1YPQXQG7U5","US","40.12273","-74.703461","6661401","PRINCETON UNIVERSITY","Princeton","NJ","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","085406000","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","117932"," ","319207",

The ability of tumor cells to switch between distinct modes of migration, called plasticity, is an important factor in the limited efficacy of invasion-directed therapeutics.  The signaling mechanisms mediating cancer cell plasticity remain poorly understood.  The proposed research will describe new roles for two closely related adhesion associated adaptor proteins, paxillin and Hic-5, in the regulation of cancer cell migration, plasticity and matrix-metalloproteinase function and thereby increase our understanding of cancer progression, malignancy and metastasis.

Bone matrix is known to turnover rapidly, but the dynamics of bone producing and remodeling cells are less well defined. We recently examined the lifespan of bone-forming osteoblasts and their source of replacement under homeostatic and injury conditions. Using newly developed genetic pulse-chase models in combination with sequential intravital microscopy, we discovered a short lifespan and unexpected dynamics of osteoblasts in vivo. Additionally, we found a population of progenitors that have the multilineage potential of MSC in vitro but have no such function in vivo. Rather, this population serves as osteolineage-restricted stem/progenitors in normal homeostasis and after bone injury. Therefore, we seek to examine the role of mature osteoblasts and their stem cells in controlling tissue regeneration and repair in physiologic circumstances. We also propose to examine the clinical benefit of osteogenic stem cells upon transplantation in bone disease conditions. The proposed experiments will elucidate: (1) the in vivo characterization of osteogenic stem cells, (2) the recovery of bone fracture by transplantation of osteogenic stem cells, and (3) the role of osteogenic stem cells in bone loss diseases. Overall, these three clinically relevant aims will further define new biological and clinical insights of osteogenic stem cells in physiological conditions.

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Myostatin is being explored as an attractive target for the discovery of function promoting anabolic therapies for
conditions associated with loss of muscle mass and physical function, such as HIV-associated weight loss and
wasting, and aging. This project aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which myostatin regulates skeletal
muscle and fat mass. We will test the hypothesis that myostatin regulates mesenchymal stem cell
differentiation through activation of the TGF-beta/SMAD pathway and cross-communication of the SMAD
signal to the Wnt/beta-catenin/TCF-4 pathway and thereby modulating myogenic and adipogenic
differentiation.","NIDDK","8230647","3/8/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK078512-04","5","R01","DK","078512","04"," ","HAFT, CAROL R","3/9/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","AIDS Clinical Studies and Epidemiology Study Section[ACE]"," ","8089691","BHASIN, SHALENDER ","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","005492160","JZ8RQC4EMDZ5","005492160","JZ8RQC4EMDZ5","US","42.337865","-71.070685","3617301","BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021182908","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","580038","201466"," ","781504",

Narrative
Aging-associated limitations of physical function impose an enormous health and socioeconomic
burden on the individual and the society; therefore, there is substantial unmet need for the
development of function promoting anabolic therapies. The proposed translational studies will
elucidate the signaling mechanisms by which testosterone increases skeletal muscle mass and
provide novel leads for the discovery of more selective anabolic molecules, such as follistatin, that

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The goal of this project is to identify mechanisms underlying expression of Sox9, the gene for a transcription
factor required for cartilage formation. We have identified two sequences upstream of the gene that are
sufficient to activate the Sox9 promoter in cartilage cells. This project will use complementary approaches in
vitro and in vivo to test the hypothesis that these sequences are both needed and sufficient for Sox9
expression in cartilage and that they bind transcription factors, collectively referred to as chondrogenin, which
are required to activate the Sox9 gene and thereby induce chondrogenesis. The results of this study are
expected to increase understanding of the molecular regulation of chondrogenesis and to provide new DNA
sequences and factors to develop urgently needed therapies for cartilage malformation and degeneration
diseases, including the highly prevalent osteoarthritis disease.","NIAMS","8293427","6/27/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR060016-03","5","R01","AR","060016","03"," ","TYREE, BERNADETTE","7/20/2010 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-K(02)]"," ","8004729","LEFEBVRE, VERONIQUE M","Not Applicable","11","OTHER BASIC SCIENCES","135781701","M5QFLTCTSQN6","135781701","M5QFLTCTSQN6","US","41.479276","-81.680233","10000858","CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU","CLEVELAND","OH","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","441950001","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","289616","167306"," ","456922",

Relevance
Metastasis and resistance to chemotherapy are the major causes of breast cancer-related
mortality. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play critical roles in both these processes, and we recently
found that CSCs can be generated by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a latent
embryonic process that has been shown to promote breast cancer progression. By using in vitro
and in vivo models, we will characterize the pleiotropic functions of FOXC2 as a central
mediator of EMT, stemness, metastatic competence and drug resistance, and the expected
results will suggest possible molecular targets that may be exploited to selectively treat
metastatic and resistant breast cancers.","NCI","8243511","3/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA155243-02","5","R01","CA","155243","02"," ","SATHYAMOORTHY, NEERAJA","3/16/2011 12:00:00 AM","2/29/2016 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","9340088","MANI, SENDURAI AYYAVOO","Not Applicable","09","PATHOLOGY","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","211207","122500"," ","333707",

Project Narrative
Current treatments for peripheral artery disease (PAD) are either palliative and treatment op-
tions are particularly limited in patients with the common co-morbidity of diabetes mellitus;
discovery of novel therapeutic options are an urgent matter of national health care priority.
Autologous transplantation with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) , a pluripotent cell that par-
ticipates in post-ischemic neovascularization, holds great promise as a means to effect symp-
tomatic relief by reversing disease pathology. The proposed work will elucidate the mecha-
nisms responsible for the loss of pluripotency and therapeutic efficacy of diabetic MSC, as well

Project narrative:
 As we complete our specific aims we will identify the molecular mechanisms behind cellular
oxygen sensing and elucidate how hypoxia regulates gene expression. In addition, we will examine
the ramifications of hypoxia-driven Sclerostin suppression, on signaling pathways (Wnt/�-catenin
signaling) that ultimately lead to bone formation. This project has the potential to yield new insight into
the relationship between hypoxia and bone and identify novel pathways that could be manipulated
pharmacologically to promote bone repair or even administered prophylactically to prevent bone
damage. Understanding the relationship between oxygen supply and bone cell physiology will also
have ramifications for the development of effective tissue engineering strategies for bone repair.","NIAMS","8197727","12/2/2011 12:00:00 AM","PAR-09-031","5R03AR057547-03","5","R03","AR","057547","03"," ","PANAGIS, JAMES S","4/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","ZAR1-MLB-G(M1)"," ","8508145","GENETOS, DAMIAN C","Not Applicable","03","VETERINARY SCIENCES","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","US","38.543675","-121.729989","577503","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS","DAVIS","CA","SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE","956186153","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","50468","23112"," ","73580",

PROJECT NARRATIVE (PI: Chen)
Human mesenchymal stem cells contribute to the maintenance and healing of many
musculoskeletal tissues, but they also can produce inappropriate cell lineages to exacerbate
disease, such as occurs with calcification of atherosclerotic vessels. They are now being
isolated as a promising source of stem cells for regenerative therapies, but again their utility
rests upon predictable control of their differentiation potential. This project is designed to
develop a better understanding of how adhesive and mechanical cues direct these stem cells to
differentiate into specific lineages, such that we may better design future approaches to treat or
prevent degenerative diseases.","NIGMS","8257527","4/16/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01GM074048-07","5","R01","GM","074048","07"," ","HAYNES, SUSAN R","5/1/2006 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Development - 2 Study Section[DEV2]"," ","6130315","CHEN, CHRISTOPHER S","Not Applicable","03","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","US","39.952982","-75.192768","6463801","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","191046205","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","207900","124740"," ","332640",

NARRATIVE
Cancer is a disease in which cells abnormally multiply and spread. This is a proposal to investigate a newly

7. Project Narrative
Stem cells derived from both epithelial and mesenchymal components are required for future
regeneration of whole teeth. The key for reconstruction from defined cellular and molecular
components and further elucidating the alterations in pathology depends on developing in vitro
systems that accurately recapitulate the in vivo functions. Although Fibroblast Growth Factors
(FGF) have been shown to play important roles in maintenance of the mouse incisor cervical
loop region where stem cells are thought to reside, the defined mechanism of FGF signaling is
not yet available for the odontogenic epithelial stem cells and surrounding microenvironment.
Our project is aimed at defining the FGF signaling pathways for the odontogenic epithelial stem
cells derived from mouse incisor cervical loops through an in vivo Fgfr2 tissue specific knockout
mouse model and developing in vitro sphere culture model.","NIDCR","8291917","6/7/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-09-042","7K08DE020883-03","7","K08","DE","020883","03"," ","KING, LYNN M","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","NIDCR Special Grants Review Committee[DSR]"," ","8803245","CHANG, JULIA YU FONG ","Not Applicable","17","NONE","835607441","HFT7XTHB6563","835607441","HFT7XTHB6563","US","30.561517","-96.274978","8266910","TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCE CTR","COLLEGE STATION","TX","OVERALL MEDICAL","778454375","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","121","Other Research-Related","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","5918","473"," ","6391",

However, the cell based therapeutic strategies still pose significant translational challenges in terms of localized delivery: inability to retain the cells at the intended site, inability to maintain cell survival, cell proliferation, and differentiation in the altered microenvironment of the injury sit. The proposed study seeks to investigate the feasibility of developing an injectable regenerative biomaterial to serve as a cell-friendly artificial transient microenvironment at the injury site to
overcome some of these challenges associated with localized cell delivery.

 The complex architecture and functions of the spleen result from intimate interactions 
among different cell types: mesenchymal cells (""basic parenchyma""), invading endothelial cells and 
colonizing hematopoietic cells. In humans, the spleen has critical roles in early hematopoiesis, 
immunity and blood filtering and its absence (as in congenital asplenia, an under-diagnosed disorder 
often recognized only at autopsy) results in a high risk for life-threatening bacterial infections and 
fatal sepsis in newborns and children. Our long-term objective is to identify genetic pathways that 
control the successive stages of spleen development: morphogenesis, expansion, and influx of 
endothelial and hematopoietic cells, since these interrelated organogenetic processes are of utmost 
importance to spleen function and, as of yet, mostly unknown. We anticipate that the new knowledge 
generated from these studies will have a deep impact on the understanding of spleen function, 
including hematopoiesis and immune response. 
 In summary, the proposed work will shed light on novel genetic and molecular networks 
that underlie the ontogeny of the spleen, a neglected organ in regard to its development. Lastly, our 
studies aspire to provide a better comprehension of the pathogenesis of congenital asplenia, as we 
put forth the prerequisite basic genetic background towards prenatal molecular diagnosis of this 
condition, which results in heavily impaired immune response to deadly bacterial infections.","NICHD","8278674","5/4/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HD061403-03","5","R01","HD","061403","03"," ","COULOMBE, JAMES N","9/15/2010 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Development - 2 Study Section[DEV2]"," ","1980680","SELLERI, LICIA ","Not Applicable","12","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","060217502","YNT8TCJH8FQ8","060217502","YNT8TCJH8FQ8","US","40.76491","-73.955055","1514803","WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","100654805","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","865","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NICHD","199200","137448"," ","336648",

We have discovered a new stem cell in human skin that has many properties in common
with malignant cells. These stem cells are located in the lower compartment of the skin,
the dermis, and can change to become melanocytes, neuronal cells, fat cells, bone cells
or cartilage cells. We plan to study how they can be maintained in the skin, what it takes
for them to migrate to the upper compartment of the skin, the epidermis, and what
triggers their change to pigment-producing melanocytes. The stem cells share many
molecules in common with melanoma cells but not with normal melanocytes, suggesting
that melanoma cells should be compared to the stem cells and not the melanocytes. As

Project Narrative
 
Vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation is a very important process during the development of blood
vessels and it is well recognized that alterations in this process play a role in the pathogenesis and progression
of several prominent cardiovascular disease states including atherosclerosis, congenital heart diseases, aortic
aneurysm,  hypertension, and restenosis. Our proposal examining the molecular mechanisms that regulate
smooth muscle differentiation should help to identify therapeutic targets for the treatment of these diseases.","NHLBI","8249061","4/2/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01HL107526-02","5","R01","HL","107526","02"," ","REID, DIANE M","4/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Vascular Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section[VCMB]"," ","8039541","CHEN, SHIYOU ","Not Applicable","10","PHYSIOLOGY","004315578","NMJHD63STRC5","004315578","NMJHD63STRC5","US","33.933474","-83.375853","676602","UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA","ATHENS","GA","SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE","306021589","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","250000","121250"," ","371250",

Project Narrative
A fundamental question in cellular and developmental biology is how a stem cell niche develops, and how
these niches support and maintain stem cell activity. We have pioneered the use of an in vivo model that we
will now use to functionally characterize our prospectively isolated MSCs. Our projects are designed to
understand the nature of these MSCs and how their microenvironment, including interactions with
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), influences their biologic activity. The overall hypothesis driving our project is
that a true mesenchymal stem cell exists within the bone marrow and the activity of this stem cell - including
interactions with hematopoietic stem cells - is dependent on its niche compartment.

Evidence suggests that metastasis is often fueled by the same processes that occur during normal development, and recently molecules called micro-RNAs, which are small naturally occurring regulators of gene expression, have been found to contribute to both normal development and tumor progression. By better understanding how these molecules operate out-of-context, researchers and physicians can develop new therapeutics to fight the spread of breast cancer.

Successful translational research by developing strategies to prevent or decrease the senescence of mesenchymal progenitors for bone, and other tissues, could provide the basis to delay the development of age-related osteoporosis and address the applicability of cellular therapies and bioengineering for bone as well as other tissues resulting from age-related degenerative diseases. The proposed studies are designed to characterize the role of alterations in the nuclear membrane lamina in stem cell senescence and bone forming potential, and how to prevent them; and thus are vital to the VA patient care mission.","VA","8246104","11/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-11-001","1I01BX000952-01A2","1","I01","BX","000952","01","A"," ","10/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Endocrinology B[ENDB]"," ","1945308","SCHILLER, PAUL CHRISTIAN","Not Applicable","24","Unavailable","079275714","U2J7L7Y9NAJ6","079275714","U2J7L7Y9NAJ6","US","25.757864","-80.214254","481022","MIAMI VA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM","MIAMI","FL","Independent Hospitals","331251624","UNITED STATES","N","10/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
We hypothesize that the primary defect in osteogenesis imperfecta lies in the HSC and that HSC
transplantation will lead to replacement of affected osteoblasts by normal cells, in turn correcting collagen
defects in bone and ameliorating and/or preventing OI pathologies. We propose to test this hypothesis using
single HSC transplantation in combination with a mouse model of OI, the oim/oim mouse. Long term, these

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Intestinal fibrosis is a major and clinically significant complication of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). While fibrosis is more commonly
associated with CD, it is also sometimes seen in chronic UC. The mechanisms by which intestinal fibrosis
occurs in the setting of IBD are incompletely understood and, in the absence of a defined mechanism, it is
difficult to explore specific therapies to halt or reverse this process. Here, we propose to examine the
underlying mechanism of fibrosis in the context of IBD by evaluating the contribution of Epithelial to
Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) to intestinal fibrosis associated with a mouse model of CD. Using transgenic
mouse models with specific molecular disruption of pathways involved in fibroblast proliferation/activation and
EMT, we will attempt to understand the genetic and biochemical underpinnings of this process in intestinal
fibrosis. We will also explore the potential therapeutic efficacy of Bone Morphogenic Protein-7 (BMP-7) as a
means to boost this antifibrotic pathway.","NIDDK","8261681","4/9/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-059","5K08DK087901-02","5","K08","DK","087901","02"," ","PODSKALNY, JUDITH M,","5/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2016 12:00:00 AM","Digestive Diseases and Nutrition C Study Section[DDK-C]"," ","9915243","FLIER, SARAH NICOLE","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","071723621","C1CPANL3EWK4","071723621","C1CPANL3EWK4","US","42.346758","-71.10256","758101","BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","022155400","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Other Research-Related","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","139390","11151"," ","150541",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
In orthopedic reconstruction, such as that of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), soft tissue grafts
often fail as a direct result of the failure to re-establish the osteochondral interface - a gradual
transition from fibrocartilage-like matrix to a bone-like matrix. The proposed research utilizes a
scaffold-based strategy to re-establish the vital osteochondral interface and improve reconstruction
success. New inorganic-organic scaffolds with gradient chemical and physical properties will be used

This proposal addresses the clinical need for dental and orthopaedic implants that promote
rapid osseointegration and earlier loading times, particularly when placed in bone compromised
by disease or physiology of the patient. By understanding how surface morphology and
chemistry modulate cell response, materials may be developed that control cell behavior
through structural and chemical signaling, without the need for pharmacologic modification. We
propose to perform studies that determine if cell and tissue responses can be improved if the
surfaces have novel nanoscale properties including structural features as well as chemistries.
We will test effectiveness both in vitro and in vivo.","NIAMS","8249082","4/18/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-052","5R01AR052102-06","5","R01","AR","052102","06"," ","PANAGIS, JAMES S","8/3/2006 12:00:00 AM","2/8/2013 12:00:00 AM","Biomaterials and Biointerfaces Study Section[BMBI]"," ","7774437","BOYAN, BARBARA D.","Not Applicable","05","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","097394084","EMW9FC8J3HN4","097394084","EMW9FC8J3HN4","US","33.762977","-84.42296","676603","GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","ATLANTA","GA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","303320415","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/8/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","83503","52060"," ","135563",

Project Narrative
There will never be enough donor lungs available to meet current and future transplantation
needs. In contrast, de-cellularization of whole cadaveric human lungs will result in an intact scaffold
that can be re-cellularized with adult stem cells, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS)
derived from individual patients and subsequently utilized for autologous transplantation. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that human lung can be successfully de-cellularized and re-cellularized
with both adult stem cells and with lung epithelial cells. The proposed multi-institutional collaborative
studies will utilize state-of-the-art bioengineering techniques to develop optimal methods for growing
functional lung tissue in de-cellularized cadaveric human lungs. This will provide a potentially limitless
supply of unrelated donor cadaveric lungs for use in diseases such as emphysema, pulmonary
fibrosis, and others for which there is currently no effective cure.","NHLBI","8321903","7/16/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-11-026","5R21HL108689-02","5","R21","HL","108689","02"," ","BLAISDELL, CAROL J","8/18/2011 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-N(M2)"," ","1931353","WEISS, DANIEL J","Not Applicable","At-Large","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","066811191","Z94KLERAG5V9","066811191","Z94KLERAG5V9","US","44.478216","-73.200657","8738101","UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE","BURLINGTON","VT","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","054051704","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","144222","71664"," ","215886",

In addition to specific components of the craniofacial skeleton, neural crest cells also form melanocytes, neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, and smooth muscle. Moreover, many craniofacial abnormalities have their origin in problems at different phase of neural crest cell development ranging from initial formation, to migration or differentiation. One major contributor to craniofacial defects occurs during their departure from the neural tube, which involves a classic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This application examines epigenetic role of PHD12 in NC EMT and its long term effects on formation and development of the face. Because neural crest-derived cells are involved in a variety of birth defects such as cleft palate and various types of cancer, our results on the normal mechanisms of neural crest development will provide important clues regarding the mistakes that may lead to abnormal development or loss of the differentiated state.

In addition to specific components of the craniofacial skeleton, neural crest cells also form melanocytes, neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, and smooth muscle. Moreover, many craniofacial abnormalities have their origin in problems at different phase of neural crest cell development ranging from initial formation, to migration or differentiation. One major contributor to craniofacial defects occurs during their departure from the neural tube, which involves a classic epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This application examines epigenetic role of PHD12 in NC EMT and its long term effects on formation and development of the face. Because neural crest-derived cells are involved in a variety of birth defects such as cleft palate and various types of cancer, our results on the normal mechanisms of neural crest development will provide important clues regarding the mistakes that may lead to abnormal development or loss of the differentiated state.

PROJECT NARRATIVE
There are currently no effective treatments to halt progression of lung scarification in patients with
pulmonary fibrosis. The goal of this application is to delineate a specific set of signals that emanate from
the prototypical wound repair cytokine, TGF�1, and drive pulmonary fibrosis. If successful, the studies
should define a specific signaling pathway that could be quantified in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis
patients and serve as a basis for targeted therapy, avoiding the expected toxicities of prolonged global
inhibition of TGF�1 signaling.","NHLBI","8204941","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL044712-21","5","R01","HL","044712","21"," ","EU, JERRY PC","1/1/1991 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Lung Injury, Repair, and Remodeling Study Section[LIRR]"," ","1881986","CHAPMAN, HAROLD A","Not Applicable","12","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","US","37.78689","-122.448998","577508","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO","SAN FRANCISCO","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","941432510","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","247500","134888"," ","382388",

Project Narrative:
About 80% of cancer deaths are associated with systemic disease, also known as
'metastasis'. Many studies suggest that the genetic alterations that accumulate in the
cancer cells define, in part, the metastatic potential. Nevertheless, components of the
tumor stroma, such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and pericytes, may play a role in
metastasis. Several studies suggest pericytes as new potential therapeutic targets to
inhibit tumor angiogenesis and subsequently tumor growth. Our proposal is designed to
functionally determine the contribution of pericytes in primary tumor growth and
metastasis, and identify new therapies to inhibit metastasis.","NCI","8210865","12/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA155370-02","5","R01","CA","155370","02"," ","MOHLA, SURESH","1/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","10/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","Developmental Therapeutics Study Section[DT]"," ","1858925","KALLURI, RAGHU ","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","071723621","C1CPANL3EWK4","071723621","C1CPANL3EWK4","US","42.346758","-71.10256","758101","BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","022155400","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","10/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","207500","153550"," ","361050",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Alternative splicing is a fundamentally important process in which the same gene can generate different
proteins that have different functions, and alterations in this process are implicated in numerous diseases,
including cancer. We have identified an essential alternative splicing regulatory protein that is expressed in a
specific cell type, the epithelial cell, and which is required for development of many organs. The loss of
expression of this gene may be one process that contributes to the invasion and metastasis of many cancers.","NIGMS","8280449","6/14/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01GM088809-09","5","R01","GM","088809","09"," ","HOODBHOY, TANYA","5/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Molecular Pathobiology Study Section[CAMP]"," ","1902860","CARSTENS, RUSS PAUL","Not Applicable","03","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","US","39.952982","-75.192768","6463801","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","191046205","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","196020","117612"," ","313632",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Neurulation is defined as a series of morphogenetic movements that result in the formation of
the neural tube, a dorsal hollow nerve cord that constitutes the rudiment of the entire adult
central nervous system. Knowledge of the mechanisms of secondary neurulation are
essential, given the high incidence of human posterior spinal cord malformations. However,
despite decades of research, the cellular and genetic basis for this type of neurulation
remains poorly understood. The goal of this research proposal is to use the various genetic
tools and labeling techniques available in the zebrafish, to investigate the mechanisms
underlying secondary neurulation. These studies will ultimately increase our understanding of
how neurulation is orchestrated and provide a molecular basis for exploring the etiology of
posterior neural tube defects in humans.","NIGMS","8307404","7/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01GM085290-04","5","R01","GM","085290","04"," ","HOODBHOY, TANYA","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Neurogenesis and Cell Fate Study Section[NCF]"," ","9166092","BREWSTER, RACHEL MELISSA","Not Applicable","07","BIOLOGY","061364808","RNKYWXURFRL5","061364808","RNKYWXURFRL5","US","39.300978","-76.610648","820103","UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALT CO CAMPUS","BALTIMORE","MD","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","212500001","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","218625","103531"," ","322156",

We will determine the best route towards clinical efficacy, i.e., direct formation of the engineered material within the defect, or a process where tissues are matured in vitro and then implanted.

PROJECT NARRATIVE 
  
Alternative splicing allows the same gene transcript to be processed into proteins with different functions in 
different cell types, at different stages of development, and in numerous diseases.  We identified essential 
master regulators of alternative splicing that control the expression of hundreds of genes, thereby resulting in a 
distinct set of proteins forms that are specific to epithelial cells.  The kidney is a predominantly epithelial organ 
and as such the complete program of epithelial cell splicing controlled by these regulators is proposed to be 
essential for kidney development and function.  Identification of the complete program of gene regulation 
controlled by these epithelial splicing proteins will provide fundamental insights with broad applications to our 
understanding of human health and diseases.

Fracture healing, which is necessary for maintenance of skeletal integrity, typically efficiently occurs, but is
compromised in certain conditions, including aging. This proposal investigates the role of a key gene,
cyclooxygenase-2, and its expression and function during key processes of fracture healing. Insights gained
from this work will enhance the understanding and treatment of fractures in patients with compromised healing,
and has particular potential to improve bone repair in the elderly.","NIAMS","8286051","6/4/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR048681-09","5","R01","AR","048681","09"," ","WANG, FEI","4/16/2003 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","1880536","O'KEEFE, REGIS J","ZHANG, XINPING ","25","ORTHOPEDICS","041294109","F27KDXZMF9Y8","041294109","F27KDXZMF9Y8","US","43.16888","-77.615939","7047101","UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER","ROCHESTER","NY","SCHOOL OF MEDICINE & DENTISTRY","146270140","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","213840","116543"," ","330383",

Cancers of epithelial origin represent at least 80% of all human cancers and are often the most difficult to cure.
The life threatening aspect of epithelial cancer is metastasis and this process is dependent upon the loss of
epithelial cell organization a process that is controlled by the E-cadherin receptor. E-cadherin holds epithelial
cells together and suppresses growth and metastasis. When E-cadherin is lost epithelial cancers are free to
metastasize or migrate to different organs. We have discovered a signaling pathway that regulates both E-
cadherin's ability to hold cells together and also the loss of E-cadherin from epithelial cancers.","NCI","8250252","7/6/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA104708-08","5","R01","CA","104708","08"," ","WOODHOUSE, ELIZABETH","7/2/2004 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section[TCB]"," ","6228781","ANDERSON, RICHARD A.","Not Applicable","02","PHARMACOLOGY","161202122","LCLSJAGTNZQ7","161202122","LCLSJAGTNZQ7","US","43.068377","-89.40086","578503","UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON","MADISON","WI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","537151218","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","194203","94188"," ","288391",

Project Narrative
Diabetes is a major public health concern in the United States, accounting for 180 billion dollars in annual
health costs. Diabetes-induced impairments in new blood vessel growth greatly increase the severity of the
sequelae caused by various ischemic processes, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease,
peripheral vascular disease and impaired wound healing. Recovery from ischemic injury requires new blood
vessel growth, termed neovascularization, and requires functional participation by stem and progenitor cells.

neovascularization. This proposal takes an innovative approach to elucidate this dysfunction and find new
ways to approach diagnosis and treatment of diabetic vascular complications.","NIDDK","8272667","4/2/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK074095-09","5","R01","DK","074095","09"," ","JONES, TERESA L Z","9/30/2005 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Surgery, Anesthesiology and Trauma Study Section[SAT]"," ","7053106","GURTNER, GEOFFREY C","BROWNLEE, MICHAEL A","18","SURGERY","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","US","37.429038","-122.178178","8046501","STANFORD UNIVERSITY","STANFORD","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","943052004","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","341854","127342"," ","469196",

Project Narrative
Bone grafts are critically needed in surgical procedures to reconstruct skeletal
defects resulting from trauma, chronic diseases, tumor removal and congenital
anomalies. Autologous bone grafts are the clinical gold standard, but necessitate
donor site trauma and morbidity; allogeneic or xenogeneic grafts are associated
with immunorejection, pathogen transmission and suboptimal healing and
synthetic materials such as hydroxyapatite suffer from poor integration. In this
proposal, we have engineered vascularized bone grafts from the combined
actions of vascular progenitor cells and bone progenitor cells; the vascularized
bone grafts can be tailored to any shape and dimension, and integrate with host's
existing bone, thus providing an improved treatment modality for bone defects.","NIDCR","8308943","6/28/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-279","5R01DE018248-04","5","R01","DE","018248","04"," ","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","9/25/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-B(03)M]"," ","1866984","MAO, JEREMY J","Not Applicable","13","DENTISTRY","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","US","40.841253","-73.940404","1833205","COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","100323725","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","353334","203527"," ","556861",

NARRATIVE
Our goal is to determine how hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their
circulating fibroblast precursors (CFPs) directly influence tumor progression and identify mechanisms that
regulate the contribution of these cells to tumor. Findings from these studies will lead to a better understanding
of basic tumor biology as well as identify novel potential therapeutic targets based on HSC-derived CFP/CAF
participation in tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, these studies have the potential to lead to the
identification of unique cancer associated molecular signatures that may prove useful for stratifying patients
and predicting metastasis and clinical outcomes, eventually leading to improved diagnostic and prognostic
values.","NCI","8217145","2/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA148772-02","5","R01","CA","148772","02"," ","MUFSON, R ALLAN","2/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","7775909","LARUE, AMANDA C.","Not Applicable","01","PATHOLOGY","183710748","NHV3GTWSALA7","183710748","NHV3GTWSALA7","US","32.788289","-79.954891","7575301","MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA","CHARLESTON","SC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","294074636","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","207500","53950"," ","261450",

Project Narrative:
This research project will analyze the role of an enzyme complex called telomerase in chronic fibrotic lung
diseases, such as in various interstitial lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This enzyme is
responsible for maintaining the length of telomeres, repeated pieces of DNA at the ends of chromosomes, but
it is unknown why this enzyme is expressed at high levels in diseased lungs. This project will attempt to
clarify the importance of this enzyme in the development of fibrotic lung disease and thus provide new insights
into many of these diseases that currently lack an effective cure or therapy. It is hoped that attainment of
the study's objectives will provide new ideas for effective treatment and management of these diseases.","NHLBI","8225216","2/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL077297-08","5","R01","HL","077297","08"," ","EU, JERRY PC","7/5/2004 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","Lung Injury, Repair, and Remodeling Study Section[LIRR]"," ","1861132","PHAN, SEM H","Not Applicable","12","PATHOLOGY","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","US","42.244005","-83.73915","1506502","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR","ANN ARBOR","MI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","481091276","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","247500","124865"," ","372365",

Project Narrative
Prematurity and bronchopulmonary dyplasia (BPD) are increasingly common causes of asthma in older
children. This application seeks to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the
development of BPD, focusing on the role of mesenchymal stromal cells and their differentiation into
myofibroblasts, the key effector cell in lung scarring. Insight provided from the proposed studies may lead to
new methods to diagnose, prevent and treat BPD, a common precedent to childhood asthma.","NHLBI","8250317","6/9/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01HL079339-07","5","R01","HL","079339","07"," ","BLAISDELL, CAROL J","7/24/2006 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2016 12:00:00 AM","Lung Cellular, Molecular, and Immunobiology Study Section[LCMI]"," ","2479071","HERSHENSON, MARC B.","Not Applicable","12","PEDIATRICS","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","US","42.244005","-83.73915","1506502","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR","ANN ARBOR","MI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","481091276","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","250000","138750"," ","388750",

Loss of transparency of the lens, or cataract, is the leading cause of blindness worldwide
despite the availability of effective surgery in developed countries. Extracapsular
cataract extraction is the most frequently performed surgical procedure in North
America, costing over 3.5 billion dollars each year, and can frequently lead to
complications such as the development of secondary cataract (posterior capsular
opacification (PCO). Thus, an understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms
regulating the normal and pathological differentiation of the lens is necessary in order to
develop therapeutic strategies for the treatment and/or prevention of cataracts. In the
proposed research we will investigate the cell signaling mechanisms responsible for two
fibrotic cataracts, anterior subcapsular cataracts (ASC) and PCO and further determine
how these mechanisms can be inhibited. Specifically we will focus on those pathways
mediated by transforming growth factor beta (TGF�) and the matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) since both of have been implicated in these cataracts. Ultimately, it is hoped
that the data obtained from the proposed studies will lead to therapeutic strategies for
mitigating cataract formation.","NEI","8323802","8/8/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01EY017146-07","5","R01","EY","017146","07"," ","ARAJ, HOUMAM H","3/1/2006 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Anterior Eye Disease Study Section[AED]"," ","8363724","WEST-MAYS, JUDITH A","Not Applicable","n/a","Unavailable","207510108","Q7EMP68DMNM5","207510108","Q7EMP68DMNM5","CA","43.233408","-79.94964","4997001","MCMASTER UNIVERSITY","HAMILTON","ON","Unavailable","L8S 4K1","CANADA","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","867","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NEI","224686","17975"," ","242661",

This proposal seeks to test the hypothesis that smoking cigarettes impairs the ability of cells to sense low oxygen states, which is required for induction of endochondral bone repair. Thus, in the presence of carbon monoxide, mesenchymal stem cells may fail to respond to hypoxic conditions which under normal circumstances would drive terminal differentiation to hypertrophic chondrocytes. Restoring the cellular response to hypoxia could have important consequences for those fracture patients at high risk for nonunion and poor outcome after injury.

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Recent technical and conceptual advances from our team1-13 lead to the suggestion that mechanics of the cel-
lular monolayer in the lung, and in other organ systems as well, may be dominated by a change of state called
the jamming transition. This new perspective leads logically to important new questions. In normal physiology,
for example, do cellular monolayers tend to form solidlike aggregated sheets -with excellent barrier function
and with little possibility of cell invasion or escape- because constituent cells are jammed? In pathophysiol-
ogy, do certain cell populations become fluidlike and permissive of paracellular leak, transformation, invasion
or cell escape because they become unjammed? To answer these questions, our interdisciplinary team will
test the jamming hypothesis in well-characterized endothelial and epithelial monolayer systems. And to test
the limits of applicability of the jamming hypothesis, we will study four well-characterized stable cell lines pre-
and post-EMT. These experimental studies will be made possible by an enabling new technology that we pro-
pose to develop: Monolayer Stress Microscopy.","NHLBI","8253706","3/23/2012 12:00:00 AM","PAR-07-352","5R01HL107561-02","5","R01","HL","107561","02"," ","NOEL, PATRICIA","4/6/2011 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Respiratory Integrative Biology and Translational Research Study Section[RIBT]"," ","1887476","FREDBERG, JEFFREY J","Not Applicable","07","PUBLIC HEALTH & PREV MEDICINE","149617367","UNVDZNFA8R29","149617367","UNVDZNFA8R29","US","42.335241","-71.102433","3212904","HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH","BOSTON","MA","SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH","021156028","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","430381","187916"," ","618297",

Project)Narrative)
Despite recent improvements in mortality for breast cancer patients, it is still not known why many patients
relapse even after an initial response to conventional endocrine and/or chemotherapies. To effectively target
breast cancer tumor initiating cells thought to be responsible for intrinsic therapeutic resistance and recurrence,
we have identified preclinical mouse models that develop claudin-low/spindloid tumors, where the bulk of the
tumors cells appear to be tumor initiating cells. These now provide novel models for the elucidation of critical
signaling pathways and therapeutics required to eliminate these cells. )","NCI","8209289","12/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA148761-03","5","R01","CA","148761","03"," ","WATSON, JOANNA M","3/17/2010 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Molecular Pathobiology Study Section[CAMP]"," ","7353752","ROSEN, JEFFREY MARK","PEROU, CHARLES M.","09","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","US","29.711148","-95.39695","481201","BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","HOUSTON","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","770303411","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","394937","96738"," ","491675",

It is a debilitating disease associated with progressive join destruction, functional disability, and decreased life expectancy. This study aims to advance the first anti-inflammatory mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based product for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike any of the currently available anti-inflammatory medications, MSCs used in this therapy are anticipated to go to the affected sites, to directly treat the inflammatio, and to promote repair of the affected joints. By going to work directly at the inflamed tissues it s expected that the adverse effects of conventional anti-inflammatory medications will be avoided. The new technology used in the preparation of the MSC-product (MSC2) being tested here overcomes the major obstacle of current MSC-based therapy by ensuring a consistently effective and reproducible anti-inflammatory MSC phenotype.

Relevance to Public Health
Alternative RNA splicing is a central aspect of most normal and disease processes.
Little is known about the factors and pathways that regulate alternative RNA splicing.
We propose to study how alternative splicing of CD44 is regulated by the Ras signaling
pathway. These studies will both increase our knowledge of mechanisms controlling
alternative splicing and as well the factors that control CD44 activity in diseases such as
cancer.","NIGMS","8325075","8/27/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01GM034277-28","5","R01","GM","034277","28"," ","BENDER, MICHAEL T","12/1/1984 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Molecular Genetics B Study Section[MGB]"," ","7355826","SHARP, PHILLIP A","Not Applicable","07","MISCELLANEOUS","001425594","E2NYLCDML6V1","001425594","E2NYLCDML6V1","US","42.359476","-71.093853","4911501","MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","CAMBRIDGE","MA","ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS","021421029","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","325156","214146"," ","539302",

Project Narrative
Heart failure is a common condition carrying a high burden of disability and mortality. Current estimates are
that heart failure accounts for approximately one million hospitalizations and
$10 billion in health care costs in the United States per year. The main underlying causes of heart failure are
ischemic heart disease, hypertension and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, whose common pathophysiologic

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting approximately 21 million Americans at an annual cost of over $60 billion. Given the severely impaired quality of life and the limitations of current treatments, there is an urgent need to explore new treatment strategies for the steadily growing number of OA patients. Toward that end, the proposed research will produce a continuous osteochondral tissue to heal defects in joints ravaged by arthritis and trauma.","NIAMS","8235065","3/28/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR056347-03","5","R01","AR","056347","03"," ","WANG, FEI","4/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","8258971","DETAMORE, MICHAEL S.","Not Applicable","02","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","076248616","SSUJB3GSH8A5","076248616","SSUJB3GSH8A5","US","38.951659","-95.266091","1484302","UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE","LAWRENCE","KS","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","660457552","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","182291","81921"," ","264212",

Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are multi-potent cells that have the capacity to ameliorate lung injury. In this application we propose the hypothesis that MSCs are capable of inducing immune regulation by releasing anti inflammatory mediators (TSG-6), endosomal vesicles called exosomes in which they shuttle micro RNAs, and transfer mitochondria to other cells. Micro RNAs are powerful regulators of the expression of genes and Mitochondria are one of the most complex organelles found in eukaryotic cells and mitochondrial dysfunction has also been implicated in aging, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cardiovascular, and lung diseases.

Using our recently established NMR methods, this set of experiments will for the first time, examine whether the ENDO lower ATP production capacity via creatine kinase (CK) and ATPase results in the ENDO vulnerability in LVH hearts. Using swine models of LVH secondary to pressure overload or post-infarction LV remodeling as well as the quantitative proteomics method, these studies will also examine whether the functional beneficial effects of the cell transplantation are associated with the improvement of ATP production capacity via both CK and ATPase, which are accompanied by the changes in the protein expression profile of the recipient myocardium particularly the growth factors family proteins and proteins involved in energy metabolism. The findings of the experiments will elucidate for the first time, the transmural gradient of ATP turnover rate via CK and ATPase in the in vivo LVH hearts with or without stem cell transplantation; and will advance our understanding of the mechanisms of cellular therapy in myocardial repair that lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for CHF patients.

LIN28A and LIN28B are cancer- promoting proteins that block the proper production of let-7; an important family of tumor suppressive microRNAs. Though LIN28A and B are expressed in a variety of human sarcomas, their roles in this context are undefined. Lin28a transgenic mice that we have developed in our lab display overgrowth, possess profoundly altered metabolism, and develop soft-tissue tumors. I will investigate the role of Lin28s and their microRNA target, let-7, in sarcoma development with a particular focus on analyzing how Lin28 causes metabolic changes in cancer. Since it is thought that cancer cells must re-structure their metabolism to gain a selective growth advantage, the Lin28 let-7 pathway could potentially be targeted to reverse the metabolic changes that are essential for cancer development.

Thus, there is a clear need for the development of additional therapeutic agents to treat patients with IBD. A new and exciting therapy that has shown promise in animal models of chronic inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis, allograft rejection, collagen-induced arthritis and graft vs. host disease is treatment with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Unfortunately, no attempt has been made to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of these immune-modifying stem cells in animal models of chronic intestinal inflammation. Because large numbers of MSCs can be grown in the laboratory, we are now in a position to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of human or mouse MSCs in a well-characterized, mouse model of chronic colitis. In addition to providing a better understanding of how (and where) MSCs to suppress intestinal inflammation, data obtained from the proposed studies may identify new therapeutic strategies that could be used to treat patients with IBD.","NIDDK","8289961","6/14/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","1R01DK091269-01A1","1","R01","DK","091269","01","A","HAMILTON, FRANK A","6/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology Study Section[GMPB]"," ","1861062","GRISHAM, MATTHEW B","Not Applicable","19","MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY","609980727","E4Z2NUYUMHF9","609980727","E4Z2NUYUMHF9","US","33.568999","-101.884244","8285902","TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIS CENTER","LUBBOCK","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","794306271","UNITED STATES","N","6/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","217500","110110"," ","327610",

Rubin: Narrative
 Evolution has led to interrelationships between bone and fat together to allow individuals to move to
food sources (skeleton necessary for locomotion), and store energy (as fat). Clearly our nation's health is
impacted by counterproductive ""activities"" -lack of exercise and caloric excess. Indeed, as the presence of
mechanical information prevents emergence of adipocytes from the marrow, exercise may be considered a
way to prevent bone marrow senescence as ""old"" bone marrow mimics unloading with increased fat. As
such, understanding the mechanisms by which mechanical input controls lineage selection is highly
relevant to an aging population, and should have high importance for understanding the pathophysiology
behind the decreased osteoprogenitor pool and how to reverse it.
 Consensus building now needs to be a targeted goal, examining the basics of how exercise impacts
these relationships by defining the fate of mesenchymal stem cells. We propose here a focused
investigation of how loading cells can affect lineage selection when that lineage is already directed toward
fat (as would be seen in non-exercising individuals, or aged individuals). We seek insights into the type of
mechanical input (how much and for how long), and the targets, beginning with �-catenin, but considering
other factors which determine lineage selection, and what strained cells become. We will examine
proximal nodes in strain activation of �-catenin and investigate alternative effectors of mechanical strain.
We will look at direct effects to prevent adipogenesis (inhibition of PPAR� expression) and indirect �-
catenin inhibition of PPAR� responses.","NIAMS","8271289","4/20/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR056655-03","5","R01","AR","056655","03"," ","SHARROCK, WILLIAM J","5/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1897246","RUBIN, JANET E","Not Applicable","04","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","US","35.926939","-79.038605","578206","UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL","CHAPEL HILL","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","275995023","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","194400","93312"," ","287712",

Narrative
Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients have mutations in the gene encoding the chloride transport protein CFTR which
when defective in the airway epithelium results in significant pulmonary morbidity and eventual mortality. The
morbidities are associated with inefficient resolution of pulmonary infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
the ensuing inflammatory response. The question is what is responsible for this over-zealous response to
bacteria burden and why can't the immune system resolve the infection efficiently. Although dysfunctional
airway clearance, mucous plugging and epithelial chemokine production are major contributors to CF
pulmonary disease, the inability to of the innate immune response to efficiently clear bacteria and ""turn-off"" the
resounding inflammation is still a prominent question. Cell-based therapies such as bone marrow

The potential significance of our application to human health is underscored by
the magnitude of prostate cancer as a health problem, which The American
Cancer Society (ACS) predicts will afflict ~200,000 men and will kill >25,000 in
the US alone. In addition, prostate cancer presents the clinician and the patient
with unique problems in terms of choosing among therapeutic options and
predicting eventual outcomes (see New York Times 26 February article ""A

should identify useful markers of tumor behavior and perhaps even targets for

PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the most common form of lung fibrosis, is a deadly disease with average
survival of three years. This proposal applies novel technologies to purify and characterize alveolar type II
cells and type II cell subtypes (CD15+) from the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Following
purification, the unique biological characteristics of IPF type II cells and CD15+ type II cells will be established.
By broadly analyzing the unique biology of IPF type II cells, these studies have the potential to identify
unsuspected causes of Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and could lead to the development of new therapies that
favorably modulate outcomes of this devastating disease.","NHLBI","8249365","3/23/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-069","5R21HL104422-02","5","R21","HL","104422","02"," ","EU, JERRY PC","4/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Lung Injury, Repair, and Remodeling Study Section[LIRR]"," ","1859770","WOLTERS, PAUL J","Not Applicable","12","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","US","37.78689","-122.448998","577508","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO","SAN FRANCISCO","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","941432510","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","125000","68125"," ","193125",

As T2RIII can mediate these effects both through regulation of TGF-2 signaling as well as through TGF-2 signaling-independent mechanisms, a more precise understanding of the role of the T2RIII in mammary carcinogenesis is required to target both T2RIII and the TGF-2 signaling pathway for the treatment of human breast cancer.

Project Narrative
Soft tissue sarcoma is a form of malignancy that occurs anywhere in the body and is
ultimately lethal to approximately 50% of those afflicted, usually secondary to
uncontrollable local or distant tumor recurrence especially in the subset of complex
Karyotype high grade pleomorphic sarcomas. The process of dissemination is not
adequately controlled due to our lack of knowledge of pertinent molecular pathways
driving the proliferation and dissemination of this disease. This research focuses on one
such pathway which appears to be particularly active in soft tissue sarcoma (the AKT
regulation of vimentin expression and function) which may ultimately prove to be
relevant as a potential point of soft tissue sarcoma therapeutic vulnerability.","NCI","8249120","4/11/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA138345-04","5","R01","CA","138345","04"," ","AULT, GRACE S","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","1886387","BARELI, MENASHE ","Not Applicable","09","BIOLOGY","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","108689"," ","309964",

Thymic degeneration is evident starting at puberty in humans and contributes to a significant loss of T cell function and the capacity to fight infection. Bone marrw transplants, while potentially curative for many forms of cancer and non-malignant blood disorders, often result in potentially lethal infections and malignant relapse, due to a prolonged loss of T cell function resulting from damage to the thymus induced by pre-transplant therapies. This study addresses a critical unmet clinical need to enhance thymic reconstitution through the identification of adult stem cells capable of reforming functional thymic tissue that may be used in treatment strategies to both minimize damage and hasten recovery of thymic function following BMT or other cytoablative therapies.

The purpose of this grant application is to support my career development activities towards a highly trained
independent physician-scientist. Metastasis is the major cause of death from breast cancer and with the
mentorship of experts of the field I will undergo training and conduct research on how breast cancer cells
acquire metastatic properties under the influence of certain non-cancerous cells that surround them. We will
also investigate whether that metastatic acquisition can be blocked by targeted chemicals opening the
possibility of developing drugs against breast cancer metastasis.","NCI","8335484","8/20/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-059","5K08CA158149-02","5","K08","CA","158149","02"," ","JAKOWLEW, SONIA B","9/20/2011 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Transition to Independence Study Section (I)[NCI-I]"," ","10522717","CHATTOPADHYAY, SHRIKANTA ","Not Applicable","08","Unavailable","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","US","42.347465","-71.082058","4907701","MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021142621","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","398","Other Research-Related","2012"," "," ","NCI","164829","13186"," ","178015",

Narrative for Rubin grant:
The role of exercise to generate a functionally sufficient skeleton involves control of the
differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells along the osteoblast lineage. The signaling cascades
initiated by mechanical stimulation of bone cells confer a cellular phenotype that is both anti-
catabolic and pro-anabolic. Work proposed here seeks to understand the loading induced signals
and responses that result in this phenotype, thereby bringing novel insights into the mechanisms
by which the loaded response is generated.","NIAMS","8287697","6/28/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR042360-16","5","R01","AR","042360","16"," ","SHARROCK, WILLIAM J","6/1/1993 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","1897246","RUBIN, JANET E","Not Applicable","04","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","US","35.926939","-79.038605","578206","UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL","CHAPEL HILL","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","275995023","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","192456","92379"," ","284835",

Project Narrative
Obesity and weight gain are associated with diabetes and many other medical problems
including cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. Obesity is characterized by an
increase in adipose tissue due to increase in size of existing fat cells, and recruitment of
new progenitors. Wnt signaling is involved in both of these processes; however, the
mechanisms are not well understood. Thus, the proposed research will provide
important insights into adipocyte and whole body metabolism, and potentially provide
insight into the medical problems of obesity and type II diabetes, two major health risks
in the United States.","NIDDK","8284216","5/17/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK062876-09","5","R01","DK","062876","09"," ","HAFT, CAROL R","2/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cellular Aspects of Diabetes and Obesity Study Section[CADO]"," ","1888062","MACDOUGALD, ORMOND A","Not Applicable","12","PHYSIOLOGY","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","US","42.244005","-83.73915","1506502","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR","ANN ARBOR","MI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","481091276","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","230324","117995"," ","348319",

Project Narrative
Although approximately 100,000 bone grafts are performed each year to regenerated bone lost due to
trauma or disease that are craniomaxillofacial in nature, the long-term results of these reconstructions
are poor due to the overwhelming tissue fibrosis and scarring that occurs following surgery. This
inflammatory, foreign body response to the grafted biomaterial remains one of the great challenges
in treating patients with birth defects, traumatic injuries or cancers in the head and mouth. Recently,
we have observed remarkable effects of the osteoporosis drug teriparatide (recombinant parathyroid
hormone, PTH) in treating patients with fracture non-unions and animal models of bone grafting, in
which the drug appears to resolve the fibrotic tissue and prevent the foreign body reaction. Here we
propose to formally demonstrate that PTH has these effects and could be used as an adjuvant

The potential of bone marrow- derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in regenerative medicine is increasingly gaining attention especially for diseases affecting the skeleton since MSC are the progenitor cells for bone-forming osteoblasts, and bone is the natural niche for MSC in the body. Thus, development of strategies to optimally use MSC should realize their potential in non-union bone defects, which are difficult to treat.

We propose to engineer biopolymer systems for the delivery of siRNA to mesenchymal stem cells to silence the expresion of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonists and thereby increase their osteogenic response. The results from this proposal will represent a significant advance for osteogenic tissue regeneration for healing bone defects, provide an increased understanding of stem cell diferentiation decision pathways, and lead to the development of a platform technology for the effective delivery of siRNA that may hold promise for many applications in regenerative and therapeutic medicine.

Project Narrative
 While being responsible for ~90% of cancer related mortality, the process of cancer-cell metastasis
remains poorly understood; many of its steps are now being revealed by studying cell-biological changes that
occur during early embryonic development. These changes also impart to cancer cells an ability to regenerate
themselves, yielding ""cancer stem cells"" that can seed new tumors. The ability to produce large numbers of
such cancer stem cells, as described in the proposed research, may present an opportunity to develop novel
anti-cancer drugs that are able to eliminate tumors by eliminating the stem cells that allow tumors to grow back
after initially successful treatments.","NCI","8196876","11/17/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA078461-13","5","R01","CA","078461","13"," ","MOHLA, SURESH","9/30/1999 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","1891586","WEINBERG, ROBERT A","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","120989983","JVKKKWN2N5N3","120989983","JVKKKWN2N5N3","US","42.363304","-71.087734","1742101","WHITEHEAD INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL RES","CAMBRIDGE","MA","Research Institutes","021421025","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","271155","257597"," ","528752",

The proposed studies will clarify the roles for PTK6 in regulating the EMT and colon tumor metastases, and will allow us to determine if PTK6 should be targeted in colon cancer.

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The production of blood cells (hematopoiesis) is a continuous, critical activity of stem cell
in the body, and its dysregulation has severe repercussions. This project will lead to a

tumors of the digestive and other epithelia.","NIDDK","8286415","6/7/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK085300-03","5","R01","DK","085300","03"," ","CARRINGTON, JILL L","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Development - 2 Study Section[DEV2]"," ","1928197","NASCONE-YODER, NANETTE M","Not Applicable","02","VETERINARY SCIENCES","042092122","U3NVH931QJJ3","042092122","U3NVH931QJJ3","US","35.832653","-78.645194","578204","NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH","RALEIGH","NC","SCHOOLS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE","276950001","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","215325","99464"," ","314789",

This research is directed at understanding the mechanistic basis for pRb's biological roles and it has the potential to provide new opportunities for diagnosis and treatment.","NCI","8299786","10/4/2012 10:38:44 AM","PAR-09-025","2P01CA042063-26A1","2","P01","CA","042063","26","A"," ","5/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2017 12:00:00 AM","ZCA1-RPRB-O(J1)","6430","1964403","LEES, JACQUELINE A.","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","001425594","E2NYLCDML6V1","001425594","E2NYLCDML6V1","US","42.359476","-71.093853","4911501","MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","CAMBRIDGE","MA","Domestic Higher Education","021421029","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM"," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012","238438","238438"," ","238438"," "," "," ",

Project Narrative
Although approximately 100,000 bone grafts are performed each year to regenerated bone lost due to
trauma or disease that are craniomaxillofacial in nature, the long-term results of these reconstructions
are poor due to the overwhelming tissue fibrosis and scarring that occurs following surgery. This
inflammatory, foreign body response to the grafted biomaterial remains one of the great challenges
in treating patients with birth defects, traumatic injuries or cancers in the head and mouth. Recently,
we have observed remarkable effects of the osteoporosis drug teriparatide (recombinant parathyroid
hormone, PTH) in treating patients with fracture non-unions and animal models of bone grafting, in
which the drug appears to resolve the fibrotic tissue and prevent the foreign body reaction. Here we
propose to formally demonstrate that PTH has these effects and could be used as an adjuvant
therapy during craniomaxillofacial reconstructive surgery.","NIDCR","8269970","5/23/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-DE-09-001","5R01DE019902-04","5","R01","DE","019902","04"," ","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","6/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZDE1-RW(11)"," ","1939533","SCHWARZ, EDWARD M.","GAZIT, DAN ","25","ORTHOPEDICS","041294109","F27KDXZMF9Y8","041294109","F27KDXZMF9Y8","US","43.16888","-77.615939","7047101","UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER","ROCHESTER","NY","SCHOOL OF MEDICINE & DENTISTRY","146270140","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","289436","61595"," ","351031",

Relevance to Public Health
Due to the limited natural ability of cartilage tissue to repair itself, damage to articular cartilage
and underlying bone often leads to significant clinical problems that afflict millions of people
worldwide, including pain, limited mobility and osteoarthritis. No strategies currently exist that
are consistently successful in treating cartilage defects of this nature. The project described in
this proposal aims to develop novel injectable, bilayered, degradable materials that can be
implanted as a vehicle for the concurrent delivery of bioactive molecules and adult derived stem
cells to promote regeneration of damaged cartilage tissue.","NIAMS","8289677","6/2/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR048756-08","5","R01","AR","048756","08"," ","WANG, FEI","4/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","1864036","MIKOS, ANTONIOS G.","KASPER, FRED KURTIS","02","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","050299031","K51LECU1G8N3","050299031","K51LECU1G8N3","US","29.720685","-95.393732","9291001","RICE UNIVERSITY","HOUSTON","TX","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","770051827","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","216000","104816"," ","320816",

Project Narrative / Relevance
 Cardiac stem cell therapy is condsidered to be a very promising approach for repair of damaged
myocardium, but the benefit in clinical trials is currently still variable. In this proposal, molecular imaging
techniques are introduced which aim at improving cell therapy by providing information about myocardial
microenvironmental conditions which are most suitable for stem cell engraftment. Such biologic imaging
strategies have the potential to guide individual therapeutic decisions, and are thus highly relevant to optimize
the benefit of stem cell therapy in the clinical management of heart disease.","NHLBI","8527039","8/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R01HL092985-03S1","3","R01","HL","092985","03","S","ADHIKARI, BISHOW B","1/15/2010 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Medical Imaging Study Section[MEDI]"," ","8742846","ABRAHAM, MARIA ROSELLE","WAHL, RICHARD LEO","07","RADIATION-DIAGNOSTIC/ONCOLOGY","001910777","FTMTDMBR29C7","001910777","FTMTDMBR29C7","US","39.329164","-76.617855","4134401","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY","BALTIMORE","MD","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","212182680","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","16088","10296"," ","26384",

This is primarily due to uncontrolled growth of smooth muscle cells at the site of injury due to balloon angioplasty or the placement of stent in coronary artery. Another major problem is the deposition of platelets that develop thrombosis. In this project we proposed to deliver autologous mesenchymal stem cells together with a novel gene at the site of injury in the heart of atherosclerotic pig during these procedures to prevent the re-narrowing of the coronary arteries and keep them patent for longer period. The goal is to test the hypothesis that the administration of stem cells with gene therapy is superior to drug-eluting stents. The proposed studies will provide conceptual support of our hypothesis and position us to translate our investigation into a clinical phase 1 study for the delivery of stem cells with the novel gene in patients with coronary artery disease.

This is primarily due to uncontrolled growth of smooth muscle cells at the site of injury due to balloon angioplasty or the placement of stent in coronary artery. Another major problem is the deposition of platelets that develop thrombosis. In this project we proposed to deliver autologous mesenchymal stem cells together with a novel gene at the site of injury in the heart of atherosclerotic pig during these procedures to prevent the re-narrowing of the coronary arteries and keep them patent for longer period. The goal is to test the hypothesis that the administration of stem cells with gene therapy is superior to drug-eluting stents. The proposed studies will provide conceptual support of our hypothesis and position us to translate our investigation into a clinical phase 1 study for the delivery of stem cells with the novel gene in patients with coronary artery disease.

Project Narrative:
A major focus in biomedical research is to understand how cancer cells invade healthy cells and metastasize
to distant sites. Lung cancer in particular is more prone to aggressive forms of the disease that are difficult to
treat effectively and have a poor clinical prognosis. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common
form of lung cancer. The 5-year mean survival for patients suffering from stage III lung cancer is less than
30%. Poor clinical prognosis for NSCLC is directly associated with late-stage diagnosis and high propensity
for metastasis to liver and bone. For the last several years our laboratory has been working on a transcription
factor called nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-�B). NF-�B is a protein complex that is found in almost all human
cells. In non-cancerous cells NF-�B is tightly regulated, however, cancer cells have found ways to elevate the
activity of NF-�B. Although it is known that cancer cells enhance NF-�B activity, the reasons for this are not
fully understood. Our laboratory has discovered that NF-�B is one of the master-switch transcription factors
required to induce phenotypic changes in cells referred to as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT
is a critical step in cancer metastasis. For the first time, our laboratory can demonstrate that following the
induction of EMT, NF-�B is required to orchestrate changes associated with the induction and maintenance of
cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells are believed to act as a ""seed"" which is able to reestablish malignant
disease. This proposal will identify critical EMT-induced genes that are required for induction and maintenance
of cancer stem cells. The overall goal of this project is use these newly identified gene products as novel
therapeutic targets for detection and treatment of NSCLC.","NCI","8317725","8/13/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA104397-09","5","R01","CA","104397","09"," ","JOHNSON, RONALD L","4/19/2004 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Molecular Pathobiology Study Section[CAMP]"," ","1889852","MAYO, MARTY W","Not Applicable","05","BIOCHEMISTRY","065391526","JJG6HU8PA4S5","065391526","JJG6HU8PA4S5","US","38.034207","-78.512346","1526402","UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA","CHARLOTTESVILLE","VA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","229044195","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","179217","90823"," ","270040",

CLINICAL AND HEALTH RELEVANCE
As the organ wait list continues to exceed the number of donors each year, the need for alternative therapies
to transplantation is becoming increasingly important. Yet, researchers have demonstrated that a vascular
connection is necessary in order to maintain viability in tissues beyond 100-200 microns thick. To date, there
is no effective manner in which to recreate this vascular connection. The goal of our proposed research is to
develop three-dimensional vascular beds from natural tissues, which can ultimately be used in scaffolds for
tissue engineering applications requiring immediate vascularization or which can be used as stand-alone
grafts for necrotic tissues in the body. To create the vascular construct we will use a decellularization
procedure, which we have previously developed to accurately preserve the intricate micro-architecture of
peripheral nerve, to remove the immunogenic cellular components from highly vascularized lung tissue and to
simultaneously preserve the microvessel extracellular matrix. The vascular bed will be subsequently re-
endothelialized with human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that have been transdifferentiated into an
endothelial cell phenotype. MSCs offer great potential for clinical translational because they are immune-
privileged or they can be isolated from the patient. In addition, decellularized tissues offer clinical
opportunities; in fact, most examples of current scaffold-based regenerative therapies utilize natural, acellular
tissues (e.g., SIS products from Cook Biotech, AlloDerm from LifeCell, and Avance from AxoGen; note: the
Avance nerve graft is based on the PI's decellularization processes for nerve tissue).","NIBIB","8240978","3/26/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-010","5R21EB013358-02","5","R21","EB","013358","02"," ","HUNZIKER, ROSEMARIE","4/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","Bioengineering, Technology and Surgical Sciences Study Section[BTSS]"," ","1921325","SCHMIDT, CHRISTINE E","Not Applicable","10","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","170230239","V6AFQPN18437","170230239","V6AFQPN18437","US","30.308138","-97.764903","578403","UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN","AUSTIN","TX","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","787595316","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","286","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIBIB","4671","374"," ","5045",

Project Narrative
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targets a single protein reducing its expression. As such it has great potential as
a highly selective drug. However systems for its in vivo delivery are not optimal. The present application
investigates the ability of the immuno-privileged adult mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) as well as other cell types
to deliver small interfering RNA (siRNA) to a target cell or tissue. The basis of this cell based delivery is the
gap junction channel. These channels connect the intracellular compartments of coupled cells and allow
transfer of small molecules without entry into the extracellular space. We have already established that cells
that make connexins (the building block of gap junctions) can transfer siRNAs. This application asks whether
cells can serve as a delivery system for siRNA. By a combination of experiment and mathematical modeling
we seek to determine the ability of cellular delivery of siRNA to penetrate tissues in vitro and in vivo.","NIGMS","8330252","8/27/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01GM088180-03","5","R01","GM","088180","03"," ","NIE, ZHONGZHEN","9/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Intercellular Interactions Study Section[ICI]"," ","1891199","BRINK, PETER R","COHEN, IRA S; MATHIAS, RICHARD T","01","PHYSIOLOGY","804878247","M746VC6XMNH9","804878247","M746VC6XMNH9","US","40.907353","-73.128565","5992612","STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK","STONY BROOK","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","117943362","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","261565","149092"," ","410657",

Metastasis is a series of process that tumor cells lose their stationary epithelial characteristics and
acquire migratory mesenchymal characteristics. More than 500,000 Americans lost their lives to
metastatic cancer in 2008. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for the acquisition of highly
invasive characteristics will contribute to developing therapeutic protocols for preventing and
treating cancers. __SpecificAimsTextDelimiter__ 
10. SPECIFIC AIM
Metastasis is a series of process that tumor cells lose their stationary epithelial characteristics
and acquire migratory mesenchymal characteristics(1-5). Tumor cells lose original epithelial
characteristics such as strong cell-cell adhesion, leave a primary site of the tumor and invade into
the adjacent tissues. However, molecular mechanisms critical to change the cellular
characteristics are NOT well understood. Although multiple signaling pathways are involved in the
cancer metastasis(6-11), growing evidence suggests that one of the critical signaling cascades
for the acquisition of highly invasive characteristics is Notch signaling(12-20). Notch signaling
plays a well-characterized role in cell fate specifications, stem cell renewal, and cell differentiation.
However, the role of Notch signaling, determining the invasive cell characteristics remains poorly
understood. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which Notch
signaling and its modulators regulate the invasive cell properties, thus serving as a
necessary prerequisite to developing new therapeutic protocols for treating and preventing
metastatic cancers. The specific target of our study is Mind bomb (Mib), a E3 ubiquitin ligase for
the Notch ligand, Delta. Mib ubiquitinates Delta and promotes Delta endocytosis, which is essential
for effective Notch signaling. Our hypothesis is that; Mind bomb (Mib) plays a critical role in
epithelial morphogenesis not only by promoting Notch signaling but also by interacting with
additional proteins that directly regulate epithelial cell polarity independently of Notch
signaling. Our hypothesis is based on the following observations. First, in addition to aberrant cell
fate decisions, mib mutants show morphological malformations. Second, a loss of Notch
manipulation does not completely phenocopy morphological defects in mib mutants. It suggests
that changes in mib mutants may not only be due to morphological changes accompanied with
aberrant cell fate changes following loss of Notch signaling. Third, recent studies in our lab indicate
that Mib interacts with Epb4.1l5, a critical regulator of cell polarity formation. The zebrafish is an
excellent vertebrate model system to visualize the behavior of individual cells. In this study, we
focus on the sensory organ, the posterior lateral line (pLL). During pLL morphogenesis,
migratory mesenchymal cells acquire more stationary epithelial cell characteristics. It
seems an ideal model system to investigate how these two processes, Notch-mediated cell fate
decision and epithelial morphogenesis, are regulated by Mib.
The specific aims are to:
1. Define the Notch -dependent and -independent function of Mib in pLL morphogenesis:
We will perform morphological and molecular characterization of pLL organogenesis in mib
mutants. We will investigate how Mib contributes to pLL morphogenesis in Notch-dependent and
Notch-independent manners.
2. Characterize molecular mechanism of the Notch-independent Mib function in epithelial
morphogenesis: We will focus on the investigation of Notch-independent Mib function. To
understand the molecular mechanism of this Mib function, we will focus on the interactions
between Mib and Epb4.1l5, a protein that regulates apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells.
More than 500,000 Americans lost their lives to metastatic cancer in 2008, because current drug
and radiation treatments are only partially effective or too toxic to be used safely(21). Thus, new
rationally designed therapies are urgently needed to control, cure and prevent invasive
malignancies. In this proposed study, we use the zebrafish lateral line as a model system to
understand the molecular mechanisms by which mesenchymal cells acquire epithelial cell
characteristics. We believe that the successful completion of our basic research proposed here will
be applicable to understanding the mechanisms by which stationary epithelial cells acquire the
property of highly malignant carcinoma in our bodies. It will lead to new therapies that effectively
prevent and eliminate invasive forms of cancers.","NICHD","8711843","8/14/2013 12:00:00 AM","PA-11-197","6R00HD062561-03","6","R00","HD","062561","03"," ","JAVOIS, LORETTE CLAIRE","9/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","NSS"," ","9710938","MATSUDA, MIHO ","Not Applicable","10","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","078795851","QHHJD3X516J9","078795851","QHHJD3X516J9","US"," "," ","10034169","RBHS-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL","NEWARK","NJ","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","071032757","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2013 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","865","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NICHD","22166","13078"," ","35244",

Although several drugs are available to slow bone loss and one to increase bone mass, most have been found to have side effects (estrogen-cancer, bisphosphonates-implant loosening/femur fractures, PTH-osteosarcoma in rats). No osteoporosis treatment consistently and safely increases bone formation over the long term. This VA MERIT proposal seeks to confirm and utilize a key observation that a small protein, LMP-1, influences the pool of cells that form bone and fat driving them towards bone formation rather than fat formation.

Narrative
Micro (mi)RNAs are small RNA molecules that target various messenger RNAs in cells so that they cannot be
translated into proteins and it has become clear that miRNAs are key players in regulating differentiation
processes and cancer. This proposal is aimed at defining the function of the two miRNA families, let-7 and
miR-200 and their targets in cancer progression. The results of this study have the potential to improve cancer
diagnostics and treatment through detection of miRNA targets and modulating the expression of miRNAs
and/or their targets in human cancers.","NCI","8267742","5/10/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA149356-12","5","R01","CA","149356","12"," ","JHAPPAN, CHAMELLI","7/1/2000 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Development - 1 Study Section[DEV1]"," ","6483309","PETER, MARCUS E.","Not Applicable","07","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","005436803","KG76WYENL5K1","005436803","KG76WYENL5K1","US","41.896017","-87.616602","6144650","NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO","CHICAGO","IL","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","606114579","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","190038","82139"," ","272177",

The outcomes for both of these diseases are dismal, with combined mortality reaching nearly 200,000 American lives each year. We have identified an inflammatory cell derived protein called neutrophil elastase that promotes disease progression in both IPF and lung cancer. The purpose of this proposal is to establish neutrophil elastase as a legitimate therapeutic target for patients with lung cancer and/or pulmonary fibrosis.

Project Narrative
Colorectal cancer is the second most fatal cancer in the United States, largely due to invasion and metastasis
to the liver and lymph nodes. In this proposal, we intend to understand the effects of a novel tumor suppressor,
Pdcd4, on colon tumor metastasis and the molecular mechanism involved in this process. This work will
provide a comprehensive understanding of how Pdcd4 modulates colon tumor progression and holds great
promise for novel interventions for preventing and treating colon cancer.","NCI","8197127","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA129015-04","5","R01","CA","129015","04"," ","JHAPPAN, CHAMELLI","1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","8737920","YANG, HSIN-SHENG ","Not Applicable","06","PHARMACOLOGY","939017877","H1HYA8Z1NTM5","939017877","H1HYA8Z1NTM5","US","38.042307","-84.458748","2793601","UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY","LEXINGTON","KY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","405260001","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","93593"," ","294868",

We observe high levels of pSmad2 in the absence of functional E-cadherin and T2RII in our model as well as in tumor tissues leading us to hypothesize that Activin A signaling, which intersects with TGF2 signaling at the level of Smad2 and Smad3, is activated. The overaching hypothesis of this proposal is that invading keratinocytes undergo epithelial- mesenchymal transition in response to autocrine Activin A signaling resulting in the observed cell invasion and tumorigenesis which we will address in vitro and in vivo using state-of-the-art xenograft models. !

Muscle cell-enhanced cartilage tissue engineering
Narrative:
Arthritis, characterized by inflammation and joint destruction, is a leading cause of disability in our ever-aging
society. However, effective treatment options for this prevailing disease still remain limited. We propose a
novel strategy to engineer stable cartilage tissue that is resistant to inflammation by utilizing muscle cells.
Thus, our research aspires to meet the critical need for improving cartilage regeneration and joint repair
technology, which may ultimately be developed as an effective treatment method for arthritis.","NIAMS","8298608","6/12/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-009","5R01AR059106-03","5","R01","AR","059106","03"," ","WANG, FEI","9/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","6840443","ZENG, LI ","Not Applicable","07","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","039318308","C1F5LNUF7W86","039318308","C1F5LNUF7W86","US","42.349907","-71.061712","8422704","TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON","BOSTON","MA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","021111901","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","222677","144740"," ","367417",

Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart infarction. The cell based therapy using stem
cells to cure the infarcted heart appears to be a promising approach. However, several recent studies
question the potential of in vivo effect of cell therapy, with low rates of implanted cell survival and
engraftment being the suggested causes. The proposed research will attempt myocardial repair by genetic
manipulation of stem cells prior to transplantation into infarcted heart in order to increase stem cell survival
and engraftment in ischemic microenvironment, and enhances regeneration of infarcted myocardium.","NHLBI","8279226","5/27/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL105176-03","5","R01","HL","105176","03"," ","ADHIKARI, BISHOW B","9/10/2010 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CVRS-C(02)M]"," ","8250530","XU, MEIFENG ","ASHRAF, MUHAMMAD ; JONES, WALTER KEITH","01","PATHOLOGY","041064767","DZ4YCZ3QSPR5","041064767","DZ4YCZ3QSPR5","US","39.142998","-84.503581","1523902","UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI","CINCINNATI","OH","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","452210001","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","247500","141075"," ","388575",

Because articular cartilage has very limited capacity for self-repair, injuries following trauma persist and can 
ultimately lead to osteoarthritis (OA). The resulting pain and reduced range of joint motion can severely 
impair quality of life. The studies described in this proposal should add to our understanding of factors that 
limit cell-based cartilage repair. Overcoming these factors will help improve repair outcomes and reduce the 
incidence of post-traumatic OA.","NIAMS","8333207","8/14/2012 12:00:00 AM"," ","5R00AR057105-03","5","R00","AR","057105","03"," ","WANG, FEI","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","NSS"," ","8557978","PORTER, RYAN MICHAEL","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","071723621","C1CPANL3EWK4","071723621","C1CPANL3EWK4","US","42.346758","-71.10256","758101","BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","022155400","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","141078","105896"," ","246974",

Project Narrative
A significant clinical need exists for novel implant materials capable of promoting the repair and regeneration of
injured or compromised tissues, such as damaged articular cartilage. Indeed, as cartilage has a limited natural
capacity to repair itself, damage to articular cartilage and underlying bone often leads to considerable clinical
problems that afflict million of people worldwide, including pain, limited mobility and osteoarthritis. The research
project presented in this proposal seeks to apply advanced cell culture technologies to fabricate biologically
active implant materials that can promote cells within the recipient to regenerate or repair specific damaged
tissues, in this case articular cartilage and underlying bone.","NIAMS","8234157","3/26/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR057083-04","5","R01","AR","057083","04"," ","WANG, FEI","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Biomaterials and Biointerfaces Study Section[BMBI]"," ","1864036","MIKOS, ANTONIOS G.","Not Applicable","02","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","050299031","K51LECU1G8N3","050299031","K51LECU1G8N3","US","29.720685","-95.393732","9291001","RICE UNIVERSITY","HOUSTON","TX","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","770051827","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","213840","103051"," ","316891",

Narrative
In the United States alone, over 95,000 valve replacement surgeries are now performed annually according to
the AHA. While mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves have made a dramatic impact since their
introduction in the 1960's, the 10-year mortality after replacement is still 30-55%. The need is particularly great
for pediatric patients, since these valves do not have the capacity to grow. Thus, there is great interest in
developing a new generation of tissue-engineered heart valves, and this research is aimed at the design and
testing of a completely biological living valve replacement.","NHLBI","8527302","9/7/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","3R01HL107572-02S1","3","R01","HL","107572","02","S","BLAISDELL, CAROL J","4/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Biomaterials and Biointerfaces Study Section[BMBI]"," ","1964940","TRANQUILLO, ROBERT T","Not Applicable","05","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","US","44.974119","-93.227014","1450402","UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA","MINNEAPOLIS","MN","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","554552070","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","27707","10039"," ","37746",

Narrative
In the United States alone, over 95,000 valve replacement surgeries are now performed annually according to
the AHA. While mechanical and bioprosthetic heart valves have made a dramatic impact since their
introduction in the 1960's, the 10-year mortality after replacement is still 30-55%. The need is particularly great
for pediatric patients, since these valves do not have the capacity to grow. Thus, there is great interest in
developing a new generation of tissue-engineered heart valves, and this research is aimed at the design and
testing of a completely biological living valve replacement.","NHLBI","8242099","3/26/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01HL107572-02","5","R01","HL","107572","02"," ","BLAISDELL, CAROL J","4/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Biomaterials and Biointerfaces Study Section[BMBI]"," ","1964940","TRANQUILLO, ROBERT T","Not Applicable","05","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","US","44.974119","-93.227014","1450402","UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA","MINNEAPOLIS","MN","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","554552070","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","438314","218430"," ","656744",

Project Narrative
Bone remodeling occurs throughout adult life, and requires that osteoblasts (bone
forming cells) and osteoclasts (bone removing cells) work in concert to maintain bone
mass. Osteopenia results when new bone formation cannot keep pace with bone
resorption, leading to a weakened skeleton, increased risk of fracture, and osteoporosis,
an incapacitating disease of increased prevalence with aging. As changes in BMP
activity in adult bone have been associated with osteoporosis and in the reduced ability
to heal fractures that occur with aging (Badley, 1995; Enomoto-Iwamoto et al., 1998;
Mundy et al., 1999; Rountree et al., 2004; Styrkarsdottir et al., 2003), and our data
identify BMP2 as key to normal BMP activity in adults, we believe developing a greater
understanding of the way BMP2 regulates bone homeostasis is highly relevant to
improving the health of the aging US population.","NIAMS","8302456","7/27/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR055904-04","5","R01","AR","055904","04"," ","CHEN, FAYE H","8/6/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1944055","ROSEN, VICKI ","Not Applicable","07","DENTISTRY","047006379","JDLVAVGYJQ21","047006379","JDLVAVGYJQ21","US","42.335814","-71.105033","3212902","HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL","BOSTON","MA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","021201616","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","213840","148619"," ","362459",

NARRATIVE
 The ability of cartilage to act as a shock absorber depends on the quality of the collagen
heterofibrillar network that frames cartilage. In arthritis, this collagen network is broken down leading
to a loss of normal joint function and severe pain. The goal of this study is to develop and

Narrative
The development of new cell delivery strategies that accelerate tissue formation and function upon
implantation will greatly improve the quality of life for those who suffer from nonhealing tissue defects. We seek
to determine if engineered fibrin gels possessing increased stiffness can promote vascularization and bone

7. Project Narrative:
 Accumulation of excess visceral fat (central or ""apple-shaped"" obesity) is associated with increased risk of
type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, whereas accumulation of subcutaneous adipose (peripheral or ""pear-
shaped"" obesity) does not have such a risk. Recently, we have demonstrated that certainly fundamental
developmental genes may play a role in this process. In this study we will determine the role of these genes in
adipocyte determination and differential function of adipocytes from visceral and subcutaneous depots through
studies over-expressing or knocking out there expression in preadipocytes in culture and in genetically
engineered mice in vivo.","NIDDK","8230677","2/29/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK082659-04","5","R01","DK","082659","04"," ","HAFT, CAROL R","3/15/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","Integrative Physiology of Obesity and Diabetes Study Section[IPOD]"," ","1863670","KAHN, C RONALD","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","071723084","UUUMQVGJNNX1","071723084","UUUMQVGJNNX1","US","42.346758","-71.10256","2133701","JOSLIN DIABETES CENTER","BOSTON","MA","Research Institutes","022155306","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","353763","215189"," ","568952",

Narrative
Maternal obesity significantly increases fetal and neonatal adiposity and offspring of obese mothers have a
very high risk of developing obesity in later life. This application will address the mechanisms underlying this

Narrative
The objective of this study is to develop new techniques for monitoring engineered chondrogenic tissues using
magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance elastography. Magnetic resonance imaging provides
three dimensional views of developing tissue at all stages of growth without the need to sacrifice the animal or
to biopsy the tissue. Magnetic resonance elastography gives a direct measure of the strength and stiffness of
regenerating tissue: critical information needed to guide the design of new methods of tissue engineering and
to assess the success of tissue implants for restoring tissue damaged by disease, injury or cancer treatment.","NIBIB","8232120","2/28/2012 12:00:00 AM","PAR-06-504","5R01EB007537-04","5","R01","EB","007537","04"," ","HUNZIKER, ROSEMARIE","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZEB1-OSR-D(J1)S"," ","1903069","MAGIN, RICHARD L","Not Applicable","07","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","098987217","W8XEAJDKMXH3","098987217","W8XEAJDKMXH3","US","41.880316","-87.687597","577703","UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO","Chicago","IL","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","606124305","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","286","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIBIB","275739","77521"," ","353260",

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: One of the most important properties of mesenchymal stem cells is
their high potency in suppressing immune reactions, which can be involved in many diseases such
autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, rejection of transplants and graft-versus-host disease
associated with bone marrow transplantation. It is likely that the very first clinical application of stem cell
research will be the use of mesenchymal stem cells to treat immune disorders. Therefore, the proposed
studies are expected to have enormous relevance to human health.","NIGMS","8220982","2/2/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01GM866889-03","5","R01","GM","866889","03"," ","DUNSMORE, SARAH","2/10/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Innate Immunity and Inflammation Study Section[III]"," ","1884701","SHI, YUFANG ","Not Applicable","06","GENETICS","617022384"," ","617022384"," ","US","40.526695","-74.470817","714203","UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-R W JOHNSON MED SCH","PISCATAWAY","NJ","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","088548021","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","198000","105558"," ","303558",

Augmentation of Trabecular Bone by Low Magnitude Strain
This work will investigate the mechanisms behind the anabolic potential of extremely low-
magnitude mechanical signals, and how they strengthen both bone and muscle. Research over the
last period of funding has also shown that these signals markedly suppress adiposity, by
influencing the differentiation pathway of mesenchymal stem cells rather than elevating the
animal's metabolism, indicating a previously unrecognized mechanical means of the regulating

Completing the goals of this proposal will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate cancer stem cells (CSCs). This will be critical for devising new treatments that selectively target these aggressive and therapy-resistant cancer cells. This will enable us to ultimately translate these findings into the clinic in order to sensitize tumors to conventional therapies by targeting critical regulation of EMT/CSC- pathways by long non-coding RNA mediated epigenetic mechanisms.

In most of these studies, treatment with hMSCs results in substantial functional benefit and these pre-clinical studies have led to the initiation of a number of clinical trials worldwide. To obtain sufficient hMSCs for these autologous clinical applications, the hMSCs must be harvested from the patient and quickly expanded in vitro before transplantation back to the patient. Recent studies suggest that neural induction of hMSCs (NI-hMSCs) prior to transplantation could provide a significant advantage over naive hMSC in treatment of animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI). Furthermore, recent studies by our collaborators reveal that the hMSCs expanded using standard cell culturing conditions lose their ability to generate NI-hMSCs after 4 passages, far short of the estimated expansion required to generate sufficient cell populations for clinical therapy. To address this problem, we have devised a proprietary, patent-pending cell culturing technology to effectively recreate native biophysical properties of the cellular microenvironment that encourages cells to secrete and remodel extracellular matrix (ECM) using their own endogenous machinery as a solution for increasing proliferation rates and maintaining differentiation capacity over a sufficient number of passages to generate the cells needed for therapeutic applications.

Project Narrative
Prostate cancer is second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in United States, and
thus is an important public health issue. Use of chemopreventive agents seems to be
more effective approach for the control of prostate cancer as it has long latent period of
development; sometimes over decade from precursor lesions to full blown disease.
Current grant proposal focuses on the development of one such agent, namely silibinin,
which is already consumed extensively in the United States and world-wide as a dietary
supplement and used in the clinic as a hepatoprotective agent. This compound has not
shown any toxicity in animal studies as well as in humans. The outcomes of our
proposed research will provide a mechanism-based agent for the prevention and
therapeutic intervention of prostate cancer in humans.","NCI","8212511","2/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA102514-09","5","R01","CA","102514","09"," ","MALONE, WINFRED F","7/9/2003 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Chemo/Dietary Prevention Study Section[CDP]"," ","1865330","AGARWAL, RAJESH ","Not Applicable","06","PHARMACOLOGY","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","US","39.708143","-104.724958","1199905","UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER","Aurora","CO","SCHOOLS OF PHARMACY","800452570","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","399","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","210780","111713"," ","322493",

The United States is experiencing an obesity epidemic which increasingly involves women of child bearing years. 18-35% of
pregnant American women are clinically obese, a condition which affects fetal development with long-term consequences for
offspring health, including pre-disposition to obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The underlying mechanisms are poorly defined. The
objectives of proposed studies are to explore mechanisms associated with impairment of fetal skeletal muscle development due
to maternal obesity. Knowledge obtained will allow us to further explore fetal skeletal muscle development due to maternal
obesity and other maternal physiological stresses. Molecular mediators identified are targets for interventions to ensure proper
skeletal muscle development in fetuses of obese women. Due to the importance of skeletal muscle for lifelong activities and its
close association with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, such intervention will help the increasing number of obese pregnant women
in this country to deliver healthy children.","NICHD","8306744","7/13/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01HD067449-03","5","R01","HD","067449","03"," ","RAITEN, DANIEL J","9/27/2010 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Pregnancy and Neonatology Study Section[PN]"," ","8916581","DU, MIN ","Not Applicable","05","VETERINARY SCIENCES","041485301","XRJSGX384TD6","041485301","XRJSGX384TD6","US","46.732476","-117.162915","9082001","WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY","PULLMAN","WA","EARTH SCIENCES/RESOURCES","991641060","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","865","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NICHD","159360","78883"," ","238243",

 Wounds and burns frequently scar and fail to regenerate the original architecture of the skin. 
Certain strains of mice heal skin much better in some regions of their body, and part of this may be due 
to differences in their circulating stem cells or the way they are recruited to the wound. This is a study to 
identify the cell signals that differ between normal healing and regeneration, to see how they affect the 
behavior of stem cells, and to devise a temporary, synthetic scaffold that can deliver these regenerative 
signals to restore skin structure and function.","NIAMS","8291439","7/10/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR056138-04","5","R01","AR","056138","04"," ","BAKER, CARL","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","1869024","DAVIDSON, JEFFREY M.","GUELCHER, SCOTT A; NANNEY, LILLIAN B; OPALENIK, SUSAN RENEE","05","PATHOLOGY","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","US","36.140134","-86.796274","8721001","VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY","Nashville","TN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","372032408","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","419397","234862"," ","654259",

Project Narrative
The novel biodegradable polymeric composite scaffolds to be developed in this project will offer new treatment
options for skeletal defects of various size and shape. The biomaterial will provide biological reconstruction of
the defect site by inducing bone formation following either implantation of preformed scaffolds or injection of in
situ polymerizable formulations. These two application modalities offer distinct advantages. The preformed
scaffolds allow precise control over scaffold geometry and internal architecture, while the injectable scaffolds
utilize minimally invasive surgical techniques that can lead to shortened hospital stay and faster recovery for
patients. The degradable nature of the biomaterial will not require implant retrieval, saving them time, expense,
and inconvenience.","NIBIB","8261873","3/7/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01EB003060-07","5","R01","EB","003060","07"," ","HUNZIKER, ROSEMARIE","9/30/2003 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2015 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","2126013","YASZEMSKI, MICHAEL J","LU, LICHUN ","01","Unavailable","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","US","44.022374","-92.465881","4976101","MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER","ROCHESTER","MN","Other Domestic Non-Profits","559050001","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","286","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIBIB","365819","211078"," ","576897",

PUBLIC ABSTRACT
This proposal studies transcription factor KLF17 in tumor maintenance, epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. Tumor spread from a primary site to
distant sites is responsible for most cancer death. EMT plays a critical role in tumor
spread. Currently there are few prognostic markers and therapeutics for metastatic
disease. KLF17 was recently discovered in my laboratory to be involved in EMT by a
genome-wide RNAi screen. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of KLF17 in EMT
and metastasis will provide potential prognostic marker and therapeutics for the
treatment of this deadly disease.","NCI","8215813","3/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA148759-03","5","R01","CA","148759","03"," ","AULT, GRACE S","4/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Genetics Study Section[CG]"," ","8334157","HUANG, QIHONG ","Not Applicable","03","Unavailable","075524595","DW1XZMGNFBL4","075524595","DW1XZMGNFBL4","US","39.950872","-75.195321","9340401","WISTAR INSTITUTE","PHILADELPHIA","PA","Research Institutes","191044265","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","209657","129990"," ","339647",

Project Narrative 
 Prostate cancer is the major visceral (non skin) cancer diagnosis (20% of all cancers) 
and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among men. It is the second leading cause 
of cancer mortality among American men. Prostate cancer is especially prominent among 
elderly veterans, with more than 11,000 new cases diagnosed per year in VA hospitals 
(VA Central Office data). Although surgery and radiation therapy are effective in early 
stage prostate cancer, treatment options are limited for patients with metastatic disease 
who become unresponsive to hormonal (androgen deprivation) therapy. The recent 
introduction of Taxotere chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer only prolongs 
survival by 2 to 3 months. 
 In order to develop new approaches to the treatment of advanced prostate cancer, it is 
essential that scientists better understand basic mechanisms leading cancers to spread 
from the prostate gland to other parts of the body (metastasis). Over the past few years, it 
has been recognized that cancer cells in the prostate gland begin to change their shape 
and become more aggressive over time. This change is called, ""epithelial-to- 
mesenchymal transition"", abbreviated as EMT. It is widely recognized that EMT may 
represent an important mechanism leading to metastasis. Hence, it is critical that we 
understand the details of how molecules working inside cancer cells produce EMT and 
metastasis. Once we understand how these molecules lead cancer cells to spread around 
the body, the pharmaceutical industry will be able to develop drugs to counteract these 
molecules and stop cancer metastasis. This approach will open up new avenues for the 
control of metastatic prostate cancer. 
 The goal of this grant application is to identify the molecules involved in cancer EMT 
and to show that interfering with these molecules will stop cancer cells from being able to 
invade surrounding normal tissues and metastasize around the body. We have recently 
published an article demonstrating the discovery of a new pathway by which prostate 
cancer cells become more invasive and capable of metastasis. The current grant will work 
on demonstrating the detailed molecules involved in prostate cancer EMT and begin to 
show that experimental drugs can interfere with this process of cancer dissemination. If 
successful, our research will encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs 
based on the experimental approaches that we hope to develop during this grant. These 
new drugs will be very beneficial to veterans with advanced prostate cancer. 
 This research project will also help to determine which of these ""cancer molecules"" are 
increased in prostate cancer biopsy specimens from patients who will or will not develop 
disseminated cancer in the future. Based on identifying dangerous ""cancer molecules"" in 
a patient prostate biopsy specimen, clinical doctors may be able to say which patients 
need aggressive forms of treatment to prevent metastasis or in the absence of ""cancer 
molecules"", which patients can be managed conservatively by watchful waiting rather 
than surgery (radical prostatectomy) or radiation therapy. 
 The outcome of this research will therefore be very relevance to veterans health and the 
mission of the VA.","VA","8195852","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-09-001","5I01BX000352-03","5","I01","BX","000352","03"," "," ","10/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Oncology A[ONCA]"," ","1978886","ZUCKER, STANLEY ","Not Applicable","03","Unavailable","008209124","ZQZKMKZWMXF3","008209124","ZQZKMKZWMXF3","US","40.89979","-73.306754","481063","NORTHPORT VA MEDICAL CENTER","NORTHPORT","NY","Independent Hospitals","117682200","UNITED STATES","N","10/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

We will design, fabricate, and validate a novel class of scaffolds based on electrospun nanofibers and with
continuous gradations in mineral content for rotator cuff repair - that is, surgical reattachment of the torn
tendons to their bony insertions. It is a clinically significant problem that affects approximately 30% of the

will have a major impact on shoulder function in these patients. This research will improve the health and
quality of life for individuals afflicted with rotator cuff injuries, having significant impact on the treatment of
diseases at rotator cuff and other soft tissue-to-bone interfaces (e.g., anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction).","NIAMS","8227988","6/18/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-052","7R01AR060820-02","7","R01","AR","060820","02"," ","PANAGIS, JAMES S","4/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Nanotechnology Study Section[NANO]"," ","8586579","XIA, YOUNAN ","GALATZ, LEESA M; THOMOPOULOS, STAVROS ","05","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","097394084","EMW9FC8J3HN4","097394084","EMW9FC8J3HN4","US","33.762977","-84.42296","676603","GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","ATLANTA","GA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","303320415","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","291383","153559"," ","444942",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Retinal degeneration and associated ocular vascular pathology are the leading course of irreversible blindness
in the USA, there is no effective treatment yet. We propose to develop non-invasive cell-based therapy to

Narrative
Studies proposed here will for the first time investigate hypoxia as an essential
component of the leukemic microenvironment and determine downstream mediators of
chemoresistance. Our preliminary evidence strongly suggests that targeting hypoxia
may be feasible and may render leukemic cells drug sensitive. We anticipate that
understanding of the complex interactions between ALL cells and their
microenvironment will provide mechanism-based rationale for eliminating resistant ALL
progenitor cells and provide the foundation for future clinical trials with HIF-1� inhibitors
and hypoxia-activated pro-drugs.","NCI","8220724","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA155056-02","5","R01","CA","155056","02"," ","FORRY, SUZANNE L","2/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-DTCS-A(81)S]"," ","7847414","KONOPLEVA, MARINA Y","Not Applicable","09","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","245016","81838"," ","326854",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The integrity and organization of the nucleus depends upon the function of the nuclear lamina, a
protein meshwork that underlies the nuclear envelope. Alterations in nuclear lamina
components cause several human diseases that are associated with tissue-restricted pathology,
such as Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, myocardial diseases and bone density disorders,
even though nuclear lamina proteins are found in all cells. Using genetic and molecular
approaches in Drosophila, we will determine the function of one class of nuclear lamina
proteins, the LEM domain proteins to provide insights into mechanisms of human disease of the
nuclear lamina.","NIGMS","8274838","5/14/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01GM087341-03","5","R01","GM","087341","03"," ","AINSZTEIN, ALEXANDRA M","6/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Development - 1 Study Section[DEV1]"," ","1898349","GEYER, PAMELA K.","Not Applicable","02","BIOCHEMISTRY","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","062761671","Z1H9VJS8NG16","US","41.662689","-91.547715","3972901","UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","IOWA CITY","IA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","522421320","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","193050","90761"," ","283811",

Project Narrative
 Tissue engineering holds the promise to create new organs but progress has been limited by poor
vascularization of tissue constructs and ineffective re-integration of these tissues into the systemic circulation.
To address this problem, we have developed a novel approach to engineer organ-level constructs by using
pre-existing, explanted microcirculatory beds as an autologous scaffold for tissue regeneration. Our initial
results demonstrate that viable microcirculatory beds can be maintained ex vivo, seeded with progenitor cells,
and transfected to produce therapeutic peptides - all critical initial steps toward generating vascularized organ-
level constructs.","NIBIB","8249854","4/5/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01EB005718-03","5","R01","EB","005718","03"," ","HUNZIKER, ROSEMARIE","6/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Bioengineering, Technology and Surgical Sciences Study Section[BTSS]"," ","7053106","GURTNER, GEOFFREY C","LONGAKER, MICHAEL T","18","SURGERY","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","US","37.429038","-122.178178","8046501","STANFORD UNIVERSITY","STANFORD","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","943052004","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","286","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIBIB","216270","130281"," ","346551",

Project Narrative
Work to improve options for healing and regenerating bone continues due to the lack of an optimal 
treatment regime.  This proposal addresses this concern by focusing on a method that could be adapted 
to new technologies and those already in place, since hydroxyapatite(in one form or another) is widely 
used not only in bone grafting procedures but also as a coating for metal implants.  This research, 
focusing on the E7 domain as a delivery tool specific to HA, could be used to facilitate longer and more 
reliable tethering of any number of bioactive peptides and proteins to HA containing biomaterials.

For other cancers, mutation in a rare stem cell could be the tumor-initiating event. Thus, understanding the molecular regulation of both normal and tumor stem cells has broad clinical implications in the ongoing fight against cancer. In this proposal, we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which normal stem cells are regulated, and ask how deregulation of these mechanisms causes tissue growth disorders and cancer. By better understanding the biology of normal and tumor stem cells, we can more rationally design cancer therapies.

NARRATIVE
 While p53 has been extensively characterized as a tumor suppressor, it has
been more difficult to determine if its family members, p63 and p73 play a similar role. In
the proposed studies, we will employ genetically engineered cell and mouse model
systems to determine the roles of p63 and p73 in cell metabolism and survival as well as
epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk and transition, and to discover how these roles are
deregulated during tumorigenesis. It is essential to decipher the role of these proteins in
both normal cell function and during tumorigenesis in order to design more effective anti-
cancer therapies that will target the majority of human tumors that have a defective p53
family signaling axis.","NCI","8196710","11/18/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA105436-08","5","R01","CA","105436","08"," ","WATSON, JOANNA M","3/1/2004 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Molecular Pathobiology Study Section[CAMP]"," ","1938512","PIETENPOL, JENNIFER A","Not Applicable","05","BIOCHEMISTRY","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","US","36.140134","-86.796274","8721001","VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY","Nashville","TN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","372032408","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","194203","108753"," ","302956",

Relevance to Public Health
It is predicted that currently 43.7 million Americans over the age of 50 already have or are at serious risk of
developing osteoporosis. Based on a recent surgeon general's report, in the United States there are over 1.5
million osteoporotic fractures each year, including 280,000 hip fractures and 500,000 vertebral fractures. Two
out of every 10 women and 3 out of every 10 men who suffer a fracture of the hip will die within 1 year of that
fracture, half will never return to their previous living situation, and 70-80% will never walk again unaided. The
annual direct health care costs for treatment of osteoporosis in the United States is over $18.3 billion.
Increasing evidence shows that proper differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into functional
osteoblasts plays a key role in bone health and homeostasis. Studies in both mouse and human have shown
that with age, the number of osteoblasts in marrow decreases and the degree of marrow adiposity increases.
One of the most promising therapeutic avenues for the treatment of osteoporosis is the development of
anabolic agents which promote osteoblast function. Currently, only a single osteoblast promoting drug is
approved by the FDA (teriparatide), but this compound carries significant risks and is thus indicated for use for
no more than two years. In order to better understand the genetic bases of osteoporosis and to develop new

 Up to half the women in the U.S. experience female pelvic floor disorders: stress urinary incontinence, 
fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse, but little is known about their pathophysiology and few 
nonsurgical treatments are available. In this project, we will use an animal model to determine if homing of 
adult mesenchymal stem cells could provide a possible nonsurgical treatment or preventative option. We 
will explore the possibility of making this therapy noncellular to avoid complications of cell therapy. This 
research is of high significance for development of improved therapies for female pelvic floor disorders.","NICHD","8290072","6/18/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HD059859-03","5","R01","HD","059859","03"," ","PARROTT, ESTELLA C","8/16/2010 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Urologic and Kidney Development and Genitourinary Diseases Study Section[UKGD]"," ","6659273","DAMASER, MARGOT S","Not Applicable","11","OTHER BASIC SCIENCES","135781701","M5QFLTCTSQN6","135781701","M5QFLTCTSQN6","US","41.479276","-81.680233","10000858","CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU","CLEVELAND","OH","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","441950001","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","865","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NICHD","199200","113544"," ","312744",

These additional mechanisms can also contribute to telomere maintenance in tumors expressing telomerase and likely are selected in tumors inhibited for telomerase. These studies are relevant to understanding tumorigenesis that occurs in the absence of telomerase, including human sarcomas and potentially certain types of brain tumors. )

Autogenous bone, often considered the gold standard for regenerative procedures, requires harvesting from the patient and increased morbidity; therefore allograft bone can be used as a substitute but due to processing and sterilization procedures it may have lost important proteins that help in bone formation. By developing a method of anchoring these important proteins back to this commercially available bone we hope to increase the regenerative capacity of allograft bone comparable to the level of autogenous bone.

US veterans face increased risks of arthritis compared with non-veterans due to orthopedic injuries at the military. Over the five-year CDA-2 program, Dr. Bilgen aims to develop an implantable biocomposite for cartilage repair using adult stem cells and a bioreactor that can apply mechanical stimuli on the growing tissue, which mimics the mechanical environment in the knee joint.

Knowledge regarding molecular and cellular processes that might be targets for future medications is thus highly relevant to veterans.","VA","8202501","2/10/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-RX-11-001","1I01RX000533-01A1","1","I01","RX","000533","01","A"," ","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Spinal Cord Injury/Disorders & Neuropathic Pain[RRDA]"," ","6486155","CARDOZO, CHRISTOPHER ","Not Applicable","13","Unavailable","040077133","CZ6LSS7VPWY1","040077133","CZ6LSS7VPWY1","US","40.86905","-73.903112","481060","JAMES J PETERS VA  MEDICAL CENTER","BRONX","NY","Independent Hospitals","104683904","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

It is unclear whether cigarette smoking affects endogenous stem cells. Since oral tissues are first to come in contact with smoking, this is a unique opportunity to examine the effect of smoking on the viability and regenerative potential of this unique population of pluripotent stem cell. A 1997 study comparing veteran and nonveteran smoking found 35% of all veterans were current smokers compared to 28% of the general population and 77% had smoked during their lifetime compared to 49% of the general population. This is later confirmed by Spigel's study (2007) and a VA report on National Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Program directive. Our proposal will add new knowledge of the effect of smoking on the viability and regenerative potential of adult stem cell.","VA","8141929","1/18/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-10-006","1I01BX001227-01","1","I01","BX","001227","01"," "," ","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cellular and Molecular Medicine[CAMM]"," ","1877781","CHEUNG, HERMAN S","Not Applicable","24","Unavailable","079275714","U2J7L7Y9NAJ6","079275714","U2J7L7Y9NAJ6","US","25.757864","-80.214254","481022","MIAMI VA HEALTH CARE SYSTEM","MIAMI","FL","Independent Hospitals","331251624","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

We are studying the contribution of lineage and cell migration to the pattering of the limb bud. Congenital limb
malformations are among the most common human birth defects, many, if not most, of which are attributable to
defects in the proper establishment of the limb pattern. Moreover, the general lessons we learn about the
integration of cellular behavior and extracellular signaling in organizing the limb, will serve as paradigms for

Aberration in fat cell number leads to obesity, which is rapidly becoming a serious public health problem around the world, and is related to other common diseases, such as type II diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Adipogenesis is the process that generates adipocytes from precursor cells, which involves a cascade of signaling events leading to regulation of genes that play roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. In this grant, we will identify and examine long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are increasingly found to be associated with various key functions in the cell. However, their roles in adipogenesis are completely unclear.

NARRATIVE
Intervertebral disc degenerative disorders and resulting pain may be associated with aging- or pathology-
related cell loss, and changes in cell phenotype. Cellular therapies for biologically-driven regeneration of
intervertebral disc are of great interest, whereby disc cells from human patients or progenitor cells are used to
generate new matrix in vitro or following re-implantation in vivo. This project will use a cell sorting technology
to identify a population of disc cells which retain characteristics of an immature cell phenotype, and to
investigate the key contributors or therapeutic targets for maintaining this immature cell-like phenotype and
matrix synthesis during cell regeneration.","NIAMS","8315906","8/9/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR057410-04","5","R01","AR","057410","04"," ","WANG, FEI","9/28/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","7624497","CHEN, JUN ","Not Applicable","04","ORTHOPEDICS","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","US","36.006824","-78.924579","2221101","DUKE UNIVERSITY","DURHAM","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","277054673","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","149688","83825"," ","233513",

Wnt signaling fosters osteoblast proliferation and differentiation, and perturbations of this signaling pathway
affect bone homeostasis, resulting in bone disorders in human. We discovered that a physiological function of
the homeodomain protein TGIF is to ensure proper osteoblast cell fate determination in response to Wnt
signaling. We believe that functional characterization of his newly discovered regulator of bone formation will
open a new field of investigation both in terms of understanding the mechanisms that regulate osteoblasts and
their bone matrix-secreting activity and in terms of drug discovery with the hope to improve the treatment of
osteoporosis and other low bone mass syndromes.","NIAMS","8293431","6/29/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01AR059070-04","5","R01","AR","059070","04"," ","CHEN, FAYE H","9/10/2010 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","9977356","ATFI, AZEDDINE ","Not Applicable","03","BIOCHEMISTRY","928824473","X59NJBFL8BJ3","928824473","X59NJBFL8BJ3","US","32.328724","-90.175537","5390304","UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR","JACKSON","MS","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","392164500","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","216000","106920"," ","322920",

Project Narrative
This project develops a clinically-relevant approach to cartilage repair using MSC-laden hydrogels with temporally
controlled structures subjected to physiologic mechanical conditioning to mimic the developmental paradigm of
tissue formation and maturation that occurs from the embryo to adulthood. This biomaterial system provides
receptor-matrix interactions, controlled mechanics, and tailored degradation profiles to enhance the differentiation of
encapsulated MSCs and the accumulation and distribution of formed extracellular matrix (ECM). If successful, this
approach would surmount a major hurdle in cartilage tissue engineering to provide a more structurally relevant ECM
with enhanced mechanical properties to support the intense loads found in the joint. This cartilage tissue
engineering technique could aid in the treatment of millions of patients afflicted with debilitating cartilage loss and
degeneration due to trauma or disease.","NIBIB","8223126","3/8/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-279","5R01EB008722-04","5","R01","EB","008722","04"," ","HUNZIKER, ROSEMARIE","4/13/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","7261809","BURDICK, JASON A","MAUCK, ROBERT L","03","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","US","39.952982","-75.192768","6463801","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","191046205","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","286","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIBIB","251688","126654"," ","378342",

Abnormalities in left-right development often lead to complex congenital heart defects with significant
associated morbidity and mortality but little is known about the molecular anomalies that cause these defects.
Understanding the mechanisms that regulate left-right development in model vertebrate systems will advance
our ability to understand, detect, and treat human cardiovascular malformations.","NICHD","8212159","3/6/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-09-042","5K08HD062638-03","5","K08","HD","062638","03"," ","JAVOIS, LORETTE CLAIRE","2/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Developmental Biology Study Section[CHHD-C]"," ","9241039","ARRINGTON, CAMMON ","Not Applicable","02","PEDIATRICS","009095365","LL8GLEVH6MG3","009095365","LL8GLEVH6MG3","US","40.76776","-111.832926","514002","UNIVERSITY OF UTAH","SALT LAKE CITY","UT","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","841128930","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","865","Other Research-Related","2012"," "," ","NICHD","126999","10078"," ","137077",

Health relevance:
Remodeling of the airway epithelium is a common pathological feature in chronic lung disease and a
predisposing factor in the development of lung cancer. Accordingly, understanding cellular and
molecular mechanisms of epithelial maintenance and repair are fundamental to the development of
improved therapeutic modalities for the treatment of chronic lung disease. We hypothesize that after
epithelial injury, the surrounding non-epithelial cells get reprogrammed to contribute, directly and
indirectly be secreting growth factors, to the epithelial repair.","NHLBI","8230583","2/8/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL092967-04","5","R01","HL","092967","04"," ","BLAISDELL, CAROL J","3/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","Lung Injury, Repair, and Remodeling Study Section[LIRR]"," ","9220162","DE LANGHE, STIJN PIET JOHAN","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","076443019","VLQKFEEJ3NE9","076443019","VLQKFEEJ3NE9","US","39.738343","-104.942796","5720901","NATIONAL JEWISH HEALTH","DENVER","CO","Independent Hospitals","802062761","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","247500","138600"," ","386100",

One of the critical limitations to tissue engineering is the absolute requirement of appropriate vascularization to provide oxygen and nutrients for cells engaged in the making of new tissues. This project is centered on the study of mechanisms involved in the determination of the vasculogenic fate of dental pulp stem cells. The ability of controlling the processes that regulate the differentiation of stem cells into blood vessels constitutes a major step forward towards the use of stem cell-based therapies in patients that need tissue regeneration.

Project Narrative
Osteoporosis is a debilitating disease of the skeletal system that currently affects over 10 million individuals in
the United States. Disease progression results in an increased incidence of fracture that results in serious
health consequences and will present an expanding source of morbidity and mortality in an aging global
population. While a few classes of medications are available to either prevent bone loss or increase bone
formation in the setting of osteoporosis or cancer, current therapeutics are far from ideal due to toxic side
effects, intolerance, or prohibitive cost. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop mechanism-based
treatments to prevent bone loss and to increase anabolic bone formation.

Project Narrative
 Seven million people suffer bone fractures annually in the U.S. Musculoskeletal conditions cost $215
billion/year. These numbers are increasing as the population ages. This project will develop the first
generation of injectable, strong, tough, macroporous, bone mineral-mimicking nano-apatite scaffolds with stem
cell and multiple growth factor delivery, and will study bone regeneration in animal models. Potential
applications include dental, craniofacial and orthopedic repairs. They include maxillary and mandibular
reconstruction and minimally-invasive surgeries such as filling and strengthening osteoporotic bone lesions,
with greatly enhanced bone healing and regeneration to improve the health and quality of life for millions of
people.","NIDCR","8209173","12/21/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DE014190-10","5","R01","DE","014190","10"," ","DRUMMOND, JAMES","4/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Oral, Dental and Craniofacial Sciences Study Section[ODCS]"," ","2093590","XU, HUAKUN ","Not Applicable","07","DENTISTRY","188435911","Z9CRZKD42ZT1","188435911","Z9CRZKD42ZT1","US","39.291412","-76.624753","820104","UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE","BALTIMORE","MD","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","212011508","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","184736","92368"," ","277104",

High-grade gliomas (also known as glioblastoma mutiforme) are the fastest growing type of central
nervous system tumors in humans. They are invariably associated with a bad prognosis. Recently, two
intrinsic capabilities of glioblastoma multiforme have been recognized as key traits of malignancy, the
ability to invade adjacent normal brain and produce new blood vessels. There is general agreement that
the current failures in the treatment of high-grade gliomas are mostly caused by lack of effective tools
against these features of aggressive brain tumors. This grant proposal uses cutting-edge computational
technologies recently developed at Columbia University Medical Center to exploit microarray expression
profiles from a large collection of primary glioblastoma multiforme and identify the key genetic master
regulators responsible for the most aggressive attributes of malignant gliomas (""the mesenchymal
signature""). We will perform a series of state-of-the-art experiments in cell culture systems and
experimental animals to validate the predictions made by the new algorithms. We anticipate that the
identification of the master genetic programs directing the most aggressive features of malignant gliomas
will offer the best possible targets for therapeutic intervention.","NINDS","8327774","8/8/2012 12:00:00 AM","PAR-08-184","5R01NS061776-04","5","R01","NS","061776","04"," ","FOUNTAIN, JANE W","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CB-J(02)M]"," ","6189067","IAVARONE, ANTONIO ","Not Applicable","13","NEUROLOGY","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","US","40.841253","-73.940404","1833205","COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","100323725","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","853","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NINDS","296272","178831"," ","475103",

We have found that mitochondria play a role in generation of piRNAs via the action of a signaling enzyme anchored on the mitochondrial surface. We propose to increase our understanding of how a signal generated on the mitochondrial surface regulates this process, which may involve controlling how mitochondria and the RNA structures traffic through the cell on microtubules. If successful, the proposed research could facilitate the development of tools to broadly manipulate the epigenetic structure of genes and thus control their expression, might identify some causes of male infertility, and will present a potential therapeutic opportunity for a male contraceptive.

The current research proposal is every relevant to the care of veterans who have 
experienced traumatic injury in active combat theaters. Characterization of the types of 
combat injuries observed in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi 
Freedom (OIF) has shown that traumatic bone injury is a prevalent problem. In fact the 
types of combat injuries observed in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation 
Iraqi Freedom (OIF) has shown that 26% of all extremity wounds are fractures (Owens 
BD, Kragh, Jr JF, Macaitis J, Svoboda SJ, Wenke JC. Characterization of extremity 
wounds in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. J Orthop 
Trauma 21:254-257, 2007). Head and face trauma accounts for 2% - 20% of combat 
injuries depending on the theater of Middle East conflict. Thus traumatic bone injury is 
found to be associated with active military campaigns. In those traumatic bone injuries 
that either heal slowly or do not heal, or in the case of facial and skull bone injuries that 
could also have attendant visual or hearing deficits or traumatic brain injury, increased 
morbidity, long-term rehabilitation, and even long-term disabilities are faced by such 
veterans that take a toll on the veterans themselves, their families, and the financial 
resources of the country. It is important to understand the early events in bone repair. 
These events include the generation of new bone forming cells called osteoblasts from 
more primitive cells from bone marrow (e.g. mesenchymal stem cells), and the 
restoration of new blood supply to bone. Re-establishing blood supply to bone by a 
process called angiogenesis (the sprouting of new blood vessels from existing blood 
vessels after injury) is necessary and critical for bone repair to occur. Knowledge of these 
key elements in bone repair may help to develop and deliver therapies that would hasten 
bone healing to restore bone to pre-morbid levels of strength and soundness.","VA","8258197","12/6/2011 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-08-002","5I01BX000170-04","5","I01","BX","000170","04"," "," ","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Endocrinology B[ENDB]"," ","9443584","YAMAGUCHI, DEAN T","Not Applicable","33","Unavailable","066689118","DL46AKJ5YD48","066689118","DL46AKJ5YD48","US","34.104809","-118.41105","481012","VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM","LOS ANGELES","CA","Independent Hospitals","900731003","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

Project Narrative
With a U.S. Prosthetic Implant market of about $1 billion a year and growing at a rate of 10% a
year, any improvement in osseointegration and life of the prosthetic implant will have a drastic
economic effect, especially if one takes into consideration that up to 30% of the implants in
procedures such as hip replacement do not show appropriate osseointegration. The proposed
project aims to improve the number of candidate biomaterials screened for improved
osseointegration by investigating the effect of the material surface properties and protein
adsorption on osteogenic mesenchymal stem cell behavior, using state of the art surface
characterization and gene expression technologies.","NIGMS","8213444","2/22/2012 12:00:00 AM","PAR-08-027","5SC2GM089642-03","5","SC2","GM","089642","03"," ","OKITA, RICHARD T","2/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZGM1-MBRS-X(CH)"," ","7752488","RAMIREZ-VICK, JAIME E","Not Applicable","98","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","175303262","GZRNJ1GZDBM1","175303262","GZRNJ1GZDBM1","US","18.202288","-66.577983","578704","UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MAYAGUEZ","MAYAGUEZ","PR","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","006819000","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","859","Other Research-Related","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","74250","30226"," ","104476",

Heart valves are flap-like tissues inside the heart chambers that open and close every second of the
cardiac cycle to allow blood to flow through the heart. Diseased heart valves are routinely replaced by
surgery, but available artificial devices are less than optimal and fail within 15-20 years after
implantation, mostly because they are made of non-living materials. New and improved devices are
needed for more than 300,000 patients every year. We are developing living materials comprised of
layers of tissue scaffolds to which we add the own patients' cells and shape the entire device in the
form of a natural heart valve. This tissue engineered device has the potential to adapt and remodel
with the patient, and thus will have a global impact by treating cardiovascular diseases in adults and
children.","NHLBI","8215809","2/6/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL093399-03","5","R01","HL","093399","03"," ","LUNDBERG, MARTHA","3/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Biomaterials and Biointerfaces Study Section[BMBI]"," ","7664907","SIMIONESCU, DAN TEODOR","Not Applicable","03","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","042629816","H2BMNX7DSKU8","042629816","H2BMNX7DSKU8","US","34.684286","-82.812554","1626401","CLEMSON UNIVERSITY","CLEMSON","SC","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","296340001","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","261466","94978"," ","356444",

Umbilical cord blood is being used increasingly for many patients with high-risk hematological
malignancies and genetic disorders who do not have a bone marrow donor, but is associated
with a longer time to engraftment compared to marrow. The expansion of cord blood in the
laboratory prior to infusion appears to shorten time to engraftment; additionally the treatment of
the cord blood with a sugar molecule prior to infusion appears to improve its ability to home to
the bone marrow quickly. Both these strategies will be explored in the grant thereby making the
transplant safer for patients in terms of infectious and bleeding complications and will thus
improve survival.","NCI","8213736","2/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA061508-18","5","R01","CA","061508","18"," ","MERRITT, WILLIAM D","9/17/1993 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Clinical Oncology Study Section[CONC]"," ","1866037","SHPALL, ELIZABETH J","SIMMONS, PAUL JOHN","09","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","251594","58370"," ","309964",

Project Narrative
Bone healing is complex process involving a number of different factors. Although the delivery of BMPs as
recombinant proteins can induce local bone formation and healing of bone defects, we have demonstrated
previously that local gene transfer of BMPs results in more rapid and efficient bone healing. We have shown
that gene transfer of the LIM Mineralization Protein (LMP) can induce osteogenesis and bone formation as or
more efficiently than BMP-2. The goals of this proposal are to identify the domains in LMP required for
osteogenesis, to begin to examine the mechanisms through which LMP is able to induce osteogenesis and to
examine the ability of the LMP-based domains to induce bone formation in vivo following gene and protein-
transduction mediated delivery. The successful completion of the proposal experiments will lead to a better
understanding of the pathways important for induction of osteogenesis by LMP and will result in clinically
relevant approaches to stimulate new bone formation using LMP peptides.","NIAMS","8305710","7/27/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","7R01AR051456-05","7","R01","AR","051456","05"," ","WANG, FEI","9/10/2008 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","1888670","ROBBINS, PAUL D.","Not Applicable","18","Unavailable","148230662","MGUCX773RNJ8","148230662","MGUCX773RNJ8","US","26.933813","-80.128954","10005569","SCRIPPS FLORIDA","JUPITER","FL","Research Institutes","334585284","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","209088","194919"," ","404007",

Project Narrative
 Heart disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality amongst Americans. Our studies, if
successful, will generate a novel set of well-controlled experimental evidence supporting the increased
potential for regeneration of the heart when endothelial progenitor cells are treated with 5'Azacytidine,
Trichostatin A and valproic acid. Most importantly, our results may significantly improve an existing

Project Narrative
Artificially engineered tissues (e.g., liver) could serve as organ-substitutes for clinical transplantation as well as
test systems for research and pharmaceutical development. Here, we will develop novel engineering tools to
study how nature organizes different types of ""cellular building blocks"" in building three-dimensional tissues.
This knowledge could be applied in building functional tissues for human therapies.

PROJECT NARRATIVE
This proposal aims at understanding the role of two types of intestinal cells, the fibroblasts and endothelial
cells, in gut inflammation. Specifically, the proposal will investigate how these cells respond to bacteria
normally present in the intestine, and how this response contributes to mechanisms of inflammation. The
results may allow the development of new ways to control acute and chronic intestinal inflammation.","NIDDK","8244462","3/21/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK050984-13","5","R01","DK","050984","13"," ","HAMILTON, FRANK A","9/30/1995 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Gastrointestinal Mucosal Pathobiology Study Section[GMPB]"," ","1877095","FIOCCHI, CLAUDIO ","Not Applicable","11","OTHER BASIC SCIENCES","135781701","M5QFLTCTSQN6","135781701","M5QFLTCTSQN6","US","41.479276","-81.680233","10000858","CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU","CLEVELAND","OH","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","441950001","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","205425","111957"," ","317382",

The course of cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis (OA) involves an activation of the chondrocyte
hypertrophy program in the affected cartilage, suggesting that activation of the chondrocyte

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental process during normal embryonic development
but it can also be aberrantly re-activated in a variety of diseases including fibrosis and cancer. TGF� is one of
the growth factors implicated in EMT. The successful pursuit of the studies proposed herein will elucidate the
molecular mechanism through which TGF� mediates EMT and will provide insight into the design of strategies
and therapeutics aimed at its prevention in pathological situations.","NCI","8206542","12/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA154663-03","5","R01","CA","154663","03"," ","KNOWLTON, JOHN R","1/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section[TCB]"," ","6449999","HOWE, PHILIP H","Not Applicable","01","BIOCHEMISTRY","183710748","NHV3GTWSALA7","183710748","NHV3GTWSALA7","US","32.788289","-79.954891","7575301","MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA","CHARLESTON","SC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","294074636","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","207500","98563"," ","306063",

Relevance to Public Health Statement
 Human postnatal dental stem cells are unique precursor populations which are isolated tooth. These cells
are capable of differentiating into dentin/bone-like forming cells. When implanted into immunodeficient mice,
dental stem cells can form dentin- or cement-like mineralized tissues. Although dental stem cells may present
promising application prospects in tooth regeneration and repair, currently, molecular regulation of their fate is
poorly understood. Histone demethylases are newly-identified enzymes that remove histone methyl marks
associated with gene activation or repression. While they have been implicated in developmental processes and
human diseases, it is largely unknown whether and how histone demethylases play a critical role in dental stem
cell function. In this application, we propose to examine how chromatin modification by histone demethylases
regulates gene expression and dental stem cell differentiation using molecular and genetic approaches. Our
results may provide new insights into the molecular biology of human dental stem cells. Moreover, because

Project Narrative
The goal of this project is to engineer a system to model one of the most fundamental motor circuits in the
human body, the spinal reflex arc. We will use nanotechnology and microelectronics in combination with
biomedical engineering techniques to build this hybrid biological/non-biological system. Potential benefits
include prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of developmental abnormalities in the spinal cord, rehabilitation of
chronic neurological/muscle disorders and accompanying pain, and new strategies for prosthetic and orthotic
design and evaluation.","NINDS","8217190","2/7/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-009","5R01NS050452-07","5","R01","NS","050452","07"," ","OWENS, DAVID F","9/23/2005 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-ETTN-F(02)M]"," ","1959212","HICKMAN, JAMES J","Not Applicable","07","MISCELLANEOUS","150805653","RD7MXJV7DKT9","150805653","RD7MXJV7DKT9","US","28.587878","-81.200337","513805","UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA","ORLANDO","FL","ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS","328263231","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","853","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NINDS","281209","120309"," ","401518",

Our innovation is derived from our so- called synthetic biology approach where synthetic PMEDSAH takes on biological functions; for example, supporting cell adhesion, enabling self-renewal and heparin-like binding of growth factors. Because we will derive patient-matched stem cells in completely defined and xengeneic free conditions we will positively impact both the understanding of basic stem cell biology and contribute to the development of consistent and safe regenerative therapies. As such, successful completion of the projects should enable new horizons important to the mission of the NIH.

Narrative
 This proposal is designed to investigate angiomyogenic and paracrine behavior of stem cells
reprogrammed by manipulation of HIF-1� responsive microRNAs (HRMs) using our novel approach of
treating the cells with intermittent multiple short cycles of anoxia/reoxygenation. We anticipate improved
angiomyogenic response in the infarcted heart after treatment with reprogrammed stem cells. Our proposal will
be the first to elucidate the mechanistic participation of HRMs in paracrine behavior, angiomyogenic potential

NARRATIVE
While endocrine therapies, such as the anti-estrogen tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors, are important
tools in the treatment of ER(+) breast carcinoma in the adjuvant and metastatic setting some tumors ultimately
progresses to hormone-independence and resistance. Here we examine the role and mechanisms of the novel
MEK5-Erk5 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in the regulation of cell survival and therapeutic
resistance of breast cancer cells. We further examine the role of MEK5-Erk5 signaling in the progression of
breast cancer cells to an ER�-negative and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype. The research in
this proposal is about understanding mechanisms of resistance and developing strategies to target and treat
breast cancer progression.","NCI","8260576","4/26/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA125806-03","5","R01","CA","125806","03"," ","FORRY, SUZANNE L","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Basic Mechanisms  of Cancer Therapeutics Study Section[BMCT]"," ","1900866","BUROW, MATTHEW E.","Not Applicable","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","US","29.935453","-90.123916","8424601","TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA","NEW ORLEANS","LA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","701185665","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","212648","88305"," ","300953",

Project Narrative:
This proposal will study stem cells isolated from a common childhood tumor known as infantile
hemangioma. We hope to understand how and why these stem cells have become disrupted, such
that instead of following a normal healthy pathway to become normal cells and tissue, the
hemangioma-derived stem cells form a mass of disorganized blood vessels that grows dramatically
during infancy. The results from this study may lead to new, fast-acting and safe treatments for
children with endangering hemangiomas. In addition, the studies may provide fundamental insights
into the behavior of human vascular progenitor cells which could then be applied to strategies to use
such progenitor cells for tissue repair and regeneration, and specifically to build healthy vascular
networks.","NHLBI","8248244","4/4/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL096384-04","5","R01","HL","096384","04"," ","MCDONALD, CHERYL","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cardiovascular Differentiation and Development Study Section[CDD]"," ","1917530","BISCHOFF, JOYCE E.","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","US","42.340629","-71.094923","1504801","BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021155724","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","247500","183150"," ","430650",

NARRATIVE STATEMENT
 Each year, an estimated 3-9% of Americans suffer from some kind of voice
disorders, which adversely affect the communicative abilities, quality of life, and even
the careers of individuals relying on a healthy, functional voice for their occupations.
Despite the recent advances in phonosurgical approaches and therapeutic strategies, vocal
fold lamina propria defects, such as vocal fold scarring, atrophy and sulcus vocalis,
remain to be among the most clinically challenging disorders, due to the vulnerability of
the vocal fold lamina propria to scar tissue formation and the difficulties to effectively
replace the lamina propria. The proposed research explores the potential of an innovative
tissue engineering scaffold to facilitate the functional reconstruction of the injured vocal
fold lamina propria, and could contribute to the development of effective surgical
management for such voice disorders.","NIDCD","8274723","5/17/2012 12:00:00 AM","PAR-07-287","5R03DC011145-03","5","R03","DC","011145","03"," ","SHEKIM, LANA O","6/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZDC1-SRB-Y(53)"," ","10255650","XU, CHET CHE","Not Applicable","30","OTOLARYNGOLOGY","800771545","YZJ6DKPM4W63","800771545","YZJ6DKPM4W63","US","32.814772","-96.841146","578404","UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER","DALLAS","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","753909105","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","173","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCD","96800","56991"," ","153791",

However, achieving euglycemia is difficult and may be associated with complications. Understanding cellular mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic nephropathy may help develop adjunct therapy to prevent or even reverse this complication of diabetes. Interstitial fibrosis is a prominent feature of diabetic nephropathy. We have evidence that AMPK, an energy sensor in cells and tissues, regulate matrix protein accumulation and other mesenchymal features of tubular epithelial cells in diabetes. We wish to explore the role of this kinase and identify its mechanisms of action. The studies may result in the identification of new therapeutic strategies to treat diabetic nephropathy. Specifically, the work may demonstrate the utility of AMPK activators to prevent diabetic complications not only in type 2 but also in type1 diabetes.

One of the current issues with these vascular scaffolds is the slow healing and tissue integration, in particular with drug coated stents, requiring prolonged treatment with blood thinners. The current application explore a novel way of paving the inside of the stent-treated arteries with progenitor cells, using acoustic energy generated by a catheter inside the vessel, harnessed to selectively push the cells to their target. The progenitor cells will then have the potential to regenerate the normal endothelial lining of healthy arteries, thus preventing clot formation inside the stent, and at the same time inhibit the tissue ingrowth associated with restenosis. This is an entirely new concept, and we will develop the cellular paving method from the bench top to a translational model emulating the proposed clinical application.

7. PROJECT NARRATIVE
Osteoarthritis represents the most prevalent joint disease and is a major cause of disability. Disease-modifying
therapies are not available and this is in part related to an incomplete understanding of pathogenetic
mechanisms. Specifically, osteoarthritic lesions begin at the articular cartilage surface which is important in
biomechanical function and joint lubrication and then progress to larger lesions with complete loss of cartilage.
Information on the causes of the initial cartilage surface defects is very limited. Our preliminary studies show
that the chromatin protein HMGB2 is exclusively expressed in the superficial zone of articular cartilage from
human and murine joints. With advancing age there is a reduction and loss of HMGB2 expression that is
followed by loss of cartilage cells and the onset of degenerative changes in the cartilage surface. These
observations suggest that HMGB2 is a critical factor for maintaining the integrity of the cartilage surface and
that its aging-related loss is a central pathogenetic mechanism in osteoarthritis. The proposed research has
the potential to identify new avenues for the prevention and treatment of osteoarthritis.","NIAMS","8277985","6/28/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR056026-04","5","R01","AR","056026","04"," ","TYREE, BERNADETTE","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","1864057","LOTZ, MARTIN K","Not Applicable","49","Unavailable","781613492","PHZJFZ32NKH4","781613492","PHZJFZ32NKH4","US","32.903152","-117.243436","7375802","SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE","LA JOLLA","CA","Research Institutes","920371000","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","213840","192242"," ","406082",

Project Narrative
As the second leading cause of death, cancer presents a major public health problem. Lung cancer is the second most
common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new treatments
for lung cancer. We now know that the tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in driving neoplastic transformation
and tumor progression. We have obtained evidence that targeting a protease restricted to mesenchymal derived stromal
cells, which are prevalent in a wide variety of solid tumors, inhibits tumor growth. The proposed experiments will define
the mechanisms that lead to the expression of this protease in tumors and the mechanisms by which it promotes tumor
growth. These studies are likely to lead to the clinical development of new anti-tumor therapies that target stromal cells.","NCI","8214619","3/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA141144-03","5","R01","CA","141144","03"," ","MOHLA, SURESH","4/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","1864184","PURE', ELLEN ","Not Applicable","03","Unavailable","075524595","DW1XZMGNFBL4","075524595","DW1XZMGNFBL4","US","39.950872","-75.195321","9340401","WISTAR INSTITUTE","PHILADELPHIA","PA","Research Institutes","191044265","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","207066","93234"," ","300300",

We will examine the mechanisms by which the use of female sex hormones after trauma will improve cell and
organ functions and decrease the lethality from infectious complications. We will use state-of-the-art molecular
techniques and cell-based therapy to delineate the mechanisms involved in injury pathogenesis. The funding

PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system characterized by
inflammation and loss of myelin that supports neuronal conduction. Despite years of extensive research there
is a distinct lack of highly effective treatments for the management of MS as the search for a cure remains
ongoing. This proposal will characterize a potential cell-based therapy using human stem/progenitor cells from
bone marrow to modulate immune responses so as to prevent damage and promote repair in an animal model
of MS.","NINDS","8227980","3/22/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-110","5F32NS073282-02","5","F32","NS","073282","02"," ","UTZ, URSULA","3/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F03A-F(20)L]"," ","8610867","ROBINSON, ANDREW PATRICK","Not Applicable","07","MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY","005436803","KG76WYENL5K1","005436803","KG76WYENL5K1","US","41.896017","-87.616602","6144650","NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO","CHICAGO","IL","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","606114579","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","853","Training, Individual","2012"," "," ","NINDS","53942"," "," ","53942",

Myocardial infarction (MI), as an age-related disease, is one of the leading causes of heart failure and death in the US. Currently, the best option for completely restoring cardiac function after a large MI is heart transplantation. However, it is limited by donor availability and transplant rejection. Recently, regeneration of infracted myocardium by injecting stem cells has been proposed as an alternative therapy. If the proposed studies confirm that umbilical cord blood contains a large number of embryonic- like stem cells that can be isolated by ECM adhesion procedures, and that can selectively differentiate into cardiomyocytes in vitro and reconstruct myocardium in vivo after MI, it will facilitate development of novel therapeutic approaches for cell-based regeneration to treat post-MI veteran.","VA","8196326","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-09-008","5I01BX000580-02","5","I01","BX","000580","02"," "," ","10/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Cellular and Molecular Medicine[CAMM]"," ","7939180","CHEN, XIAO-DONG ","Not Applicable","21","Unavailable","078493228","RRFHKE8Z71R7","078493228","RRFHKE8Z71R7","US","29.508404","-98.581006","481157","SOUTH TEXAS VETERANS HEALTH CARE SYSTEM","SAN ANTONIO","TX","Independent Hospitals","782294404","UNITED STATES","N","10/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

Project Narrative.
It is clear that stem cell therapy will revolutionize medicine in the 21st century. Much remains to be discovered,
but a strong argument can be made that enriched umbilical cord blood (UCB) will emerge as the one source of
stem cells that is practical and safe-enough to be scaled-up to the national-level, in support of treatment of
multiple common diseases: lymphoid cancers and thalassemias at present, and if the current explosion of
research is on track, the treatment of high-prevalence diseases such as Type 1 & Type 2 Diabetes,
neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic tissue damage, such as spinal cord injury and burns. For each of those
current and possible treatment indications, the enriched UCB stem cells must be delivered along with HLA-
Typing as the corresponding Companion Genetic Test. The goal of this R21 is to demonstrate feasibility of very
high throughput HLA-Typing, directly from raw UCB samples, as the new standard for Companion Genetic
Testing to support the processing and delivery of that stem cell therapy. Based on other funding sources,
GenUSA is already in the process of obtaining FDA approval of its core microarray technology. If approved, that
underlying FDA 510(k) application could be leveraged to seek follow-on FDA approval of the Companion Genetic
Test developed in this R21-R33 series.","NHLBI","8262309","4/9/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-12-004","1R21HL112664-01","1","R21","HL","112664","01"," ","WAGNER, ELIZABETH","4/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-P(F2)"," ","1885659","HOGAN, MICHAEL E.","Not Applicable","03","Unavailable","141832860","SGB5JFXZH469","141832860","SGB5JFXZH469","US","32.182617","-110.9202","10002951","GENOMICS USA, INC.","TUCSON","AZ","Domestic For-Profits","857135245","UNITED STATES","N","4/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","839","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","75000","30000"," ","105000",

Relevance
The lack of significant improvement in treatment outcomes for patients with
glioblastoma (GBM) for over 30 years is due largely to our failure to address the
problem of GBM cell invasion into the brain. TWIST1 is a putative oncogene
which promotes carcinoma invasion and metastasis through activation of
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). We have now confirmed TWIST1 as a
critical mediator of GBM invasion and malignancy and here will establish for the
first time the therapeutic relevance of a TWIST1 signaling network through
POSTN and Akt, in turn regulated by TWIST1 binding partners. By
demonstrating the impact of this novel pro-invasive network in GBM invasion we
will validate the importance of EMT related mechanisms for GBM, also expected
to have great relevance for a much larger group of invasive carcinomas. This
paradigm shift is expected to revolutionize our understanding of invasion in GBM,
accelerate discovery of therapeutic targets, and translate into significant
improvements in GBM patient outcomes.","NCI","8244998","11/18/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA136808-02","5","R01","CA","136808","02"," ","WOODHOUSE, ELIZABETH","3/18/2011 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","1905210","ROSTOMILY, ROBERT C","Not Applicable","07","NEUROSURGERY","605799469","HD1WMN6945W6","605799469","HD1WMN6945W6","US","47.660049","-122.31441","9087701","UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON","SEATTLE","WA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","981951016","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","207500","136950"," ","344450",

There is increasing evidence that many human cancers, including breast cancer, are driven by a small
population of cells that displays stem cell properties. These properties include self-renewal which drives
tumorigenesis and differentiation which generates the tumor bulk. Recent in vitro and animal model studies
have shown that cancer stem cells, including those of the breast, are relatively resistant to radiation therapy
and chemotherapy. There is considerable evidence that the microenvironment regulates normal mammary
development as well as tumor growth and metastasis. Since cancer stem cells may drive tumorigenesis and
metastasis as well as contributing to treatment resistance and relapse, the development of novel strategies to
target this cell population may lead to improved outcomes for women with advanced breast cancer.","NCI","8277829","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA101860-09","5","R01","CA","101860","09"," ","SATHYAMOORTHY, NEERAJA","9/1/2004 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","1872561","WICHA, MAX S.","Not Applicable","12","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","US","42.244005","-83.73915","1506502","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR","ANN ARBOR","MI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","481091276","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","158379","86316"," ","244695",

Although surgery can initially be very effective in restoring sight, in the longer term complications are common and often result in the development of a secondary cataract. A central aim in our laboratory is to devise molecular strategies that (i) prevent the aberrant lens cell behavior that occurs after surgery, and (ii) promote normal patterns of lens cell growth and differentiation so that lens clarity is maintained.

 Therapeutic options for stimulating bone formation in subjects with bone demineralization,
such as osteoporosis, are limited. This research will study an interaction between two
molecules that determine how bone forming cells replicate or differentiate to produce new bone.
Results will allow us to better understand how bone forming cells proliferate and function in
adult animals, and will disclose new ways to stimulate bone formation that may be used in the
future to discover new treatments for people with low bone mass and fractures.","NIAMS","8213516","2/28/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR056678-03","5","R01","AR","056678","03"," ","CHEN, FAYE H","2/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","1884054","CIVITELLI, ROBERTO ","Not Applicable","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","US","38.647241","-90.300814","9083901","WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY","SAINT LOUIS","MO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","631304862","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","216000","112320"," ","328320",

Project Narrative
The epicardium is a sheet of cells that covers heart muscle tissue. Recently, there has been
increased interest in epicardium because of its role in forming the blood vessels of the fetal
heart, and the potential that this activity can be reactivated in the mature heart. We have found
that epicardium can also form heart muscle cells. The overall goal of this proposal is to define
the cells and signals that the epicardium contributes to the developing and postnatal heart.
These experiments will prepare the foundation for future studies on potential therapeutic uses
of epicardium as a source of cells and signals to treat heart failure.","NHLBI","8207246","12/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL094683-04","5","R01","HL","094683","04"," ","SCHRAMM, CHARLENE A","1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-CVS-D(02)M]"," ","2107930","PU, WILLIAM TSWENCHING","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","076593722","Z1L9F1MM1RY3","US","42.340629","-71.094923","1504801","BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021155724","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","247500","183150"," ","430650",

Narrative
In this proposal we will engineer human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to express
targeted therapeutic proteins directed against overexpressed receptors in glioma cells.
Two different combinatorial therapy approaches based on targeting cell proliferation and
death pathways in glioma cells will be explored. The developed agents and strategies
will be designed to be clinically translatable and should have a major impact in
developing efficient therapies for brain tumors.","NCI","8211001","2/23/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA138922-03","5","R01","CA","138922","03"," ","FORRY, SUZANNE L","3/18/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Developmental Therapeutics Study Section[DT]"," ","8586528","SHAH, KHALID A","Not Applicable","08","Unavailable","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","US","42.347465","-71.082058","4907701","MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021142621","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","153023"," ","354298",

Project Narrative
Using viruses to kill tumor cells has shown considerable promise in the laboratory and in early clinical trials.
Yet several obstacles must be overcome before this strategy gains acceptance as a safe and potent form of
cancer therapy. The applicant has constructed a virus from herpes simplex virus type 2, called FusOn-H2,
which has produced encouraging antitumor activity in animal tumor models. He now propose to develop and
test different strategies for improving FusOn-H2 virotherapy, with the long-term goal of translating this
treatment into a clinically feasible option for patients with malignant sold tumors.","NCI","8528758","9/7/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R01CA132792-05S1","3","R01","CA","132792","05","S","OGUNBIYI, PETER","12/1/2008 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Developmental Therapeutics Study Section[DT]"," ","7740876","ZHANG, XIAOLIU ","Not Applicable","18","BIOLOGY","036837920","QKWEF8XLMTT3","036837920","QKWEF8XLMTT3","US","29.721486","-95.338112","1449402","UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON","HOUSTON","TX","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","772042610","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","15243","7602"," ","22845",

According to the National Arthritis Data Workgroup, OA affected 26.9 million adults in 2005 in the United States, and the number is projected to increase up to 40% by 2030, therefore making joint surface restoration a priority. This application is highly relevant to the field of health science because it's designed to develop new therapeutic approaches for cartilage restoration, which in turn will reduce morbidity and mortality from degenerative joint disease.

It is believed that the cancer cells change the bone marrow environment to make it more hospitable.  This proposal seeks to measure for the first time which genes are turned on in normal bone marrow cells (stromal cells) by breast cancer cells that are touching them as this occurs.  We will then identify how the cancer cells within growing tumors in mice change their own gene transcription in response to the molecular cues from adjacent bone marrow cells.  We will test whether some of these signals have arisen in bone specimens containing breast cancer.  Learning this information will guide us in selecting drugs to treat metastatic breast cancer that interrupt specific responses of the stromal cells to the cancer cells and vice versa.

Organovo's patent-pending bioprinting platform enables fabrication of 3D human tissues using cells as building blocks, without the use of synthetic or native tissue-derived biomaterials or scaffolding, yielding a tissue in vitro that recapitulates native tissue architecture and biology. The human liver tissues generated by this project have the potential to substantially improve the drug development process by providing a superior model of liver biology and liver toxicology. This effort could greatly reduce the cost of drug development by reducing the number of late stage drug failures thus the overall cost of drugs as well.

The efficiency of energy metabolism, defined as the ability to rapidly produce energy in
response to a cellular requirement, is profoundly important for many physiological
processes, such as excitation-contraction of heart and skeletal muscle. Consequently,
the inefficient production of ATP in the muscle of diabetic patients can lead to
cardiovascular disease. Through our studies of mutant mice we have identified a protein
called SLC25A25 that is important for the achieving maximal metabolic efficiency, which
when inactivated causes extreme muscle fatigue. We found major reductions of
Slc25a25 gene expression in skeletal muscle biopsies from obese and type 2 diabetic
humans that correlate with insulin sensitivity. In this proposal using genetically
engineered mice we will test the hypothesis that SLC25A25 functions by supporting the
energy requirements for muscle function and body temperature regulation.","NIDDK","8305096","4/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK089641-35","5","R01","DK","089641","35"," ","LAUGHLIN, MAREN R","5/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Integrative Physiology of Obesity and Diabetes Study Section[IPOD]"," ","1912664","MYNATT, RANDALL LEE","YOUNG, MARTIN E","06","NONE","611012324","MWYVQTQ32ME5","611012324","MWYVQTQ32ME5","US","30.404354","-91.122411","577909","LSU PENNINGTON BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH CTR","BATON ROUGE","LA","ORGANIZED RESEARCH UNITS","708084124","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","285803","104182"," ","389985",

PROJECT NARRATIVE:
Despite recent progress in medical therapy, heart failure is one of the most common causes of death in
western countries. Understanding the molecular mechanism mediating growth and death of cardiac muscle is
fundamentally important and potentially leads to better medical treatment for heart failure. This laboratory has
been working on an enzyme termed glycogen synthase kinase-3, which plays an essential role in regulating
growth and death of cardiomyocytes. Although this enzyme in the heart exists as two distinct forms, namely
alpha and beta isoforms, the function of each form is not well understood. We will investigate the function of
each isoform during heart failure, ischemic heart disease and stem cell differentiation, using genetically
modified mice and mouse models of heart failure and ischemia/reperfusion injury. The knowledge obtained
from this investigation should be useful for the development of better treatment for heart failure, ischemic injury
and stem cell therapy.

8. PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Breast cancer is the most common neoplasm afflicting women in the US and other developed
countries. This disease causes much suffering, is responsible for a large number of premature deaths and
costs the US economy a great amount each year. The source of most morbidity and mortality from breast
cancer is not the primary tumor itself, which can be removed surgically, but rather metastases to the skeleton
and soft tissues. Therefore understanding the mechanisms related to tissue invasion and metastases are
crucial for better therapy. Normal mammary development relies on many processes such as the modulation of
cell adhesion, cell proliferation, cell migration and matrix remodeling that are common to tumor invasion and
the metastatic cascade. This is particularly true of embryonic mammary development, which involves the
invasion of the nascent mammary epithelial ducts from one stromal compartment and into another. Our
preliminary data suggest that the initiation of embryonic ductal proliferation may rely on interactions between
PTHrP, Wnt and BMP signaling. All three of these growth factor pathways are also involved in breast cancer
pathogenesis. Therefore, we believe that understanding how PTHrP modulates mesenchymal Wnt and BMP
signaling to regulate embryonic mammary development may ultimately help us to understand the metastatic
process better.","NIDDK","8282942","6/27/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01DK055501-13","5","R01","DK","055501","13"," ","SATO, SHERYL M","9/30/1999 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1872589","WYSOLMERSKI, JOHN J","Not Applicable","03","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","043207562","FL6GV84CKN57","043207562","FL6GV84CKN57","US","41.303164","-72.931644","9420201","YALE UNIVERSITY","NEW HAVEN","CT","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","065208327","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","198000","129690"," ","327690",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
We propose the use of nanotechnology approaches for controlling interfaces between the hip
and knee implants and the surrounding tissues. The primary focus of this grant application is to
improve the fixation, durability and osseointegration for long-term success of Total Joint
Replacements and lower the need for recurrent multiple surgical procedures. Also, development
of new nanotechnology tools and methods will lead to a new class of functionalized
nanostructured surfaces for titanium and cobalt chrome alloys for use in biomedical implant
industry. One benefit of the diamond-diamond components will be reductions in overall device
size that will ultimately allow for a clinically less-invasive route to joint restoration and longer
implant lifetime in vivo.","NIAMS","8291149","6/13/2012 12:00:00 AM","PAR-07-352","5R01AR056665-04","5","R01","AR","056665","04"," ","PANAGIS, JAMES S","7/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-B(03)M]"," ","6490731","VOHRA, YOGESH K.","Not Applicable","07","PHYSICS","063690705","YND4PLMC9AN7","063690705","YND4PLMC9AN7","US","33.506935","-86.809252","1288803","UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM","BIRMINGHAM","AL","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","352940001","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","128304","59661"," ","187965",

 PROJECT NARRATIVE
Adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are a population of cells in the adult brain that have the ability to renew
themselves throughout life and give rise to a variety of cell types, including neurons. NSCs are of tremendous
interest for both their potential role in neural development and disease and because they may be harnessed in
various ways to treat neurodegenerative disease (e.g., Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Lou Gehrig's Diseases).
The goal of this proposal is to understand mechanisms through which biomechanical inputs from the cellular
microenvironment influence NSC neurogenesis in vitro and in vivo, which we expect will significantly add to our
understanding of NSC biology and help inform the design of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine
strategies to treat disease.","NINDS","8297995","4/20/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","1R01NS074831-01A1","1","R01","NS","074831","01","A","OWENS, DAVID F","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2017 12:00:00 AM","Biomaterials and Biointerfaces Study Section[BMBI]"," ","2242041","SCHAFFER, DAVID V","KUMAR, SANJAY ","13","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","124726725","GS3YEVSS12N6","124726725","GS3YEVSS12N6","US","37.870295","-122.268133","577502","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY","BERKELEY","CA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","947101749","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","853","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NINDS","218750","110029"," ","328779",

Using viruses to kill tumor cells has shown considerable promise in the laboratory and in early clinical trials.
Yet several obstacles must be overcome before this strategy gains acceptance as a safe and potent form of
cancer therapy. The applicant has constructed a virus from herpes simplex virus type 2, called FusOn-H2,
which has produced encouraging antitumor activity in animal tumor models. He now propose to develop and
test different strategies for improving FusOn-H2 virotherapy, with the long-term goal of translating this

Project Narrative
The replacement or restoration of function to traumatized, damaged, or lost organs and tissues is an
increasingly significant clinical problem. It is estimated that only 24,422 received organ transplants of a
possible 79,512 patients on the transplantation wait list in 2002. In addition, it is currently estimated that over
1.5 million skeletal injuries alone will require tissue graft reconstruction in the US each year, and these
numbers will continue to grow as the life expectancy of the population increases. Thus, the development of
effective strategies to harness inflammation for revascularization and regeneration of osseous tissue defects is
a significant medical need.","NIDCR","8268316","9/11/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-DE-09-001","7R01DE019935-04","7","R01","DE","019935","04"," ","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","6/5/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZDE1-RW(11)"," ","2108099","BOTCHWEY, EDWARD A.","Not Applicable","05","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","097394084","EMW9FC8J3HN4","097394084","EMW9FC8J3HN4","US","33.762977","-84.42296","676603","GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","ATLANTA","GA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","303320415","UNITED STATES","N","8/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","245025","110700"," ","355725",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Our studies conducted over the last few years have identified a signaling molecule called the hypoxia-inducible

Although the search for plasma markers for cancer is a well-established concept,
the finding of markers that are clinically useful is very infrequent. Any marker with
favorable performance characteristics would favorably impact cancer screening
and monitoring and contribute to improved survival of patients. Therefore, the
search for plasma markers for colon cancer in this proposal is critically important.","NCI","8243512","3/23/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-267","5R21CA150654-02","5","R21","CA","150654","02"," ","THURIN, MAGDALENA","4/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section[TCB]"," ","1864497","ZHANG, WEI ","HAMILTON, STANLEY R.","09","PATHOLOGY","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","394","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","108750","63075"," ","171825",

7. Project Narrative
Stem cells derived from both epithelial and mesenchymal components are required for future
regeneration of whole teeth. The key for reconstruction from defined cellular and molecular
components and further elucidating the alterations in pathology depends on developing in vitro
systems that accurately recapitulate the in vivo functions. Although Fibroblast Growth Factors
(FGF) have been shown to play important roles in maintenance of the mouse incisor cervical
loop region where stem cells are thought to reside, the defined mechanism of FGF signaling is
not yet available for the odontogenic epithelial stem cells and surrounding microenvironment.
Our project is aimed at defining the FGF signaling pathways for the odontogenic epithelial stem
cells derived from mouse incisor cervical loops through an in vivo Fgfr2 tissue specific knockout
mouse model and developing in vitro sphere culture model.","NIDCR","8588542","12/20/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-09-042","7K08DE020883-04","7","K08","DE","020883","04"," ","KING, LYNN M","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","NIDCR Special Grants Review Committee[DSR]"," ","8803245","CHANG, JULIA YU FONG ","Not Applicable","07","DENTISTRY","605799469","HD1WMN6945W6","605799469","HD1WMN6945W6","US","47.660049","-122.31441","9087701","UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON","SEATTLE","WA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","981951016","UNITED STATES","N","10/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Other Research-Related","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","88443","7075"," ","95518",

Project Narrative:
 The increasing prevalence of chronic kidney disease in our aging population represents an enormous
health burden. Because the final common pathway for most chronic nephropathies is renal fibrosis, therapies
that reverse or even slow fibrosis would have tremendous clinical impact. These studies will explore the role of
a signaling pathway called Hedgehog. Drugs are now being developed to modulate this pathway, so these
studies might identify a new use for such drugs in treating kidney fibrosis which remains a tremendous problem
in the United States and worldwide.","NIDDK","8327224","7/23/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK088923-03","5","R01","DK","088923","03"," ","HOSHIZAKI, DEBORAH K","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Pathobiology of Kidney Disease Study Section[PBKD]"," ","1902627","HUMPHREYS, BENJAMIN D.","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","030811269","QN6MS4VN7BD1","030811269","QN6MS4VN7BD1","US","42.334978","-71.105987","1080401","BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021156110","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","224925","176566"," ","401491",

NARRATIVE:
The long-term objective of this proposal is to obtain a better understanding of the
molecular mechanisms governing the first step in tumor cell dissemination, namely
motility. To accomplish this we propose to define the structure-functional relationship

A thorough understanding of the regulation of stem cell (SC) activation and self-renewal by supporting niche
cells is a crucial requirement for future tissue-specific regenerative therapies. How the niche cells in
mammalian SC niches acquire their specialized status is largely unknown. We will define the transcriptional
control of niche fate specification of dermal papilla cells in the hair follicle SC niche, establishing a much
needed mammalian model, where formation and function of the SC niche can be studied. Our work will
improve our ability to create a more normal behaving skin tissue for future therapies and will also have global
relevance for other regenerative tissues, where SC niches operate to maintain tissue homeostasis.","NIAMS","8228187","3/2/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR059143-03","5","R01","AR","059143","03"," ","BAKER, CARL","4/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2015 12:00:00 AM","Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section[ACTS]"," ","9801858","RENDL, MICHAEL ","Not Applicable","13","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","078861598","C8H9CNG1VBD9","078861598","C8H9CNG1VBD9","US","40.790525","-73.953788","3839801","ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","100296574","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","216000","147169"," ","363169",

The proposed studies are of an important and under-investigated area of cerebral aneurysm pathophysiology that would directly translate into therapies that could treat cerebral aneurysms, such as 1) endovascular devices carrying signaling mechanisms that reverse the degenerative inflammatory process and promote vascular repair, and 2) medical drug therapies that arrest the degenerative inflammatory process and stabilize aneurysms from growing and progressing to rupture. The proposed research has relevance to the public health and the Nation's economic well-being because there is a significant incidence of cerebral aneurysms in the population, 3.6-6.0%; cerebral aneurysms are associated with significant morbidity and mortality; and the costs of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the United States are enormous ($5.6 billion/year).","NINDS","8303296","7/26/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-09-042","5K08NS067058-04","5","K08","NS","067058","04"," ","KOENIG, JAMES I","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","NST-1 Study Section[NST-1]"," ","9729256","HOH, BRIAN LIM","Not Applicable","03","NEUROSURGERY","969663814","NNFQH1JAPEP3","969663814","NNFQH1JAPEP3","US","29.67667","-82.340932","513806","UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA","GAINESVILLE","FL","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","326115500","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","853","Other Research-Related","2012"," "," ","NINDS","165166","13213"," ","178379",

Exploitation of biophysical control of tissue regeneration is virtually unexplored territory in the field of tissue 
engineering, despite extensive studies in developmental biology that have clearly shown the importance of 
changes in membrane potential and endogenous electric fields during tisue/organ development and 
regeneration. Thus, the goal of this program is to determine the impact of membrane potential-regulated 
signaling on bone and adipose tissue regeneration, formation, and patterning. The outcome of this program 
would be an entirely new approach to tissue formation and control in vitro, with major implications for 
regeneration in vivo. Rational modulation of these powerful biophysical controls, with or without more 
traditional biochemical controls, will allow greater control of tissue development and function. Building upon 
principles from developmental biology, progress from the proposed studies will have a profound impact on the 
field of tissue engineering. Understanding the role of biophysical factors on tissue behavior will yield insight into 
fundamental control mechanisms underlying tissue growth and regeneration, offering a new perspective to the 
current tissue engineering paradigm. Such an understanding will also define a set of well-characterized 
pharmacological and molecular-genetic tools to enable novel approaches to complex tissue patterning.","NIAMS","8303026","7/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR055993-03","5","R01","AR","055993","03"," ","WANG, FEI","8/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Musculoskeletal Tissue Engineering Study Section[MTE]"," ","2059300","KAPLAN, DAVID L.","LEVIN, MICHAEL ","07","ENGINEERING (ALL TYPES)","073134835","WL9FLBRVPJJ7","073134835","WL9FLBRVPJJ7","US","42.423895","-71.1092","8422701","TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD","Boston","MA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","021111817","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","216000","107395"," ","323395",

Public Health Relevance Statement
 The studies proposed will shed light on the process of tumor initiation and
progression and enhance our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in lung
cancer. The finding that Rac1b might function as an oncogene and that loss of Rac1 is
""lethal"" in the context of activated K-ras raises the possibility that targeting Rac1 in Ras-

Osteoporosis is a common degenerative disease of aging, and treatments available to cure this debilitating
disease are lacking. Parathyroid hormone and the Wnt signaling pathway both act to control bone formation.

into the processes by which bone mass is increased may ultimately result in novel therapies for osteoporosis.","NIAMS","8296071","6/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","PAR-09-031","5R03AR059942-03","5","R03","AR","059942","03"," ","CHEN, FAYE H","8/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/6/2013 12:00:00 AM","ZAR1-MLB-G(M1)"," ","1900877","WU, JOY Y","Not Applicable","08","Unavailable","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","US","42.347465","-71.082058","4907701","MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021142621","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/6/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","6840","5267"," ","12107",

The renal medulla plays essential roles in body salt and water balance, and the regulation of
systemic blood pressure. The proposed study employs mouse genetic, molecular and cell
biological approaches to elucidate the molecular and cellular machinery guiding renal medulla
formation. The proposed research is not only critical for the mechanistic understanding of kidney
organogenesis and renal physiology, but will also provide the molecular basis for the development
of new strategies on the repair and regeneration of the disrupted/atrophic renal medulla resulted
from renal and urological anomalies.","NIDDK","8247792","4/3/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK085080-03","5","R01","DK","085080","03"," ","HOSHIZAKI, DEBORAH K","6/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Urologic and Kidney Development and Genitourinary Diseases Study Section[UKGD]"," ","9494406","YU, JING ","Not Applicable","05","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","065391526","JJG6HU8PA4S5","065391526","JJG6HU8PA4S5","US","38.034207","-78.512346","1526402","UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA","CHARLOTTESVILLE","VA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","229044195","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","239039","124306"," ","363345",

Project Narrative
 This is a proposal to study how the skull forms and how two genes-Msx2 and Msx2-control the
shape of bones of the skull. Msx genes are of special interest because humans with mutations in MSX2 and
MSX2 have birth defects that affect their skulls and teeth. By studying how these genes work, we will learn
more about basic processes of skull development as well as how mutations in Msx1 and 2 lead to birth defects.
In the long term, this work may help to devise new treatments of such birth defects.","NIDCR","8246311","3/7/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DE019650-04","5","R01","DE","019650","04"," ","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1891907","MAXSON, ROBERT E.","Not Applicable","37","BIOCHEMISTRY","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","US","34.065915","-118.196446","7636101","UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA","Los Angeles","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","900894304","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","232774","144320"," ","377094",

Narrative
Intrauterine growth restriction is a common, biologically important condition with individuals at risk of multiple
morbidities, including chronic lung disease (CLD) and adult obesity. When inappropriately regulated, PPARg,
contributes to these IUGR related diseases. This project aims to uncover the mechanisms of inappropriate
PPARg regulation and identifies a dietary intervention that potentially improves the consequences of IUGR.

Our preliminary studies show that two processes-cadherin dimer assembly and
disassembly- control the strength and plasticity of intercellular contacts. Experiments
designed in this proposal will uncover detailed mechanisms of these two crucial
processes. The completion of this research will allow us to design animal experiments
and clinical studies aimed at understanding the role of cadherin adhesion in wound
healing and pathological morphogenesis, such as lymphocyte epidermal infiltration. The
work will make a significant impact in other fields, because cadherin adhesion is a basic
process that organizes virtually all human tissues. The study is also a critical step toward
the development of synthetic adhesion modulators and their application in medicine.","NIAMS","8310147","8/3/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01AR044016-17","5","R01","AR","044016","17"," ","BAKER, CARL","9/20/1996 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section[ACTS]"," ","1877714","TROYANOVSKY, SERGEY M","Not Applicable","07","DERMATOLOGY","005436803","KG76WYENL5K1","005436803","KG76WYENL5K1","US","41.896017","-87.616602","6144650","NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO","CHICAGO","IL","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","606114579","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","242078","127091"," ","369169",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Reductions in branching morphogenesis and nephrogenesis (renal hypodysplasia)
result in abnormal renal architecture and in renal failure and adult-onset hypertension.
The cellular and molecular processes involved are poorly understood, but abundant
evidence suggests that bone morphogenetic (BMP) signaling is critically involved. We
will study the role of the BMP co-receptor Dragon in BMP signaling in kidney
development and function.","NIDDK","8329654","8/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01DK069533-08","5","R01","DK","069533","08"," ","HOSHIZAKI, DEBORAH K","3/1/2005 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Urologic and Kidney Development and Genitourinary Diseases Study Section[UKGD]"," ","1925053","LIN, HERBERT Y","Not Applicable","08","Unavailable","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","073130411","FLJ7DQKLL226","US","42.347465","-71.082058","4907701","MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021142621","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","205425","155013"," ","360438",

Project Narrative
Osteoporosis is a common degenerative disease of aging, and treatments available to cure this debilitating
disease are lacking. Parathyroid hormone and the Wnt signaling pathway both act to control bone formation.
This proposal seeks to understand how these two pathways interact at the molecular level, as greater insights
into the processes by which bone mass is increased may ultimately result in novel therapies for osteoporosis.","NIAMS","8538220","1/9/2013 12:00:00 AM","PAR-09-031","7R03AR059942-04","7","R03","AR","059942","04"," ","CHEN, FAYE H","8/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZAR1-MLB-G(M1)"," ","1900877","WU, JOY Y","Not Applicable","18","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","US","37.429038","-122.178178","8046501","STANFORD UNIVERSITY","STANFORD","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","943052004","UNITED STATES","N","1/10/2013 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","41160","23461"," ","64621",

and extravasation (at the target organ). This new hypothesis provides clinically relevant information for therapeutic strategies that innovately aim at reducing the metastasis engraftment by closing the gate through which the metastatic cancer cell transit into the normal bone, thus improving the devastating outcomes.

This project proposes to study the function of two signaling pathways, Shh and Wnt, in both early
androgen-independent and late sexually dimorphic phases of external genitalia development.
Genital malformations including hypospadias occur at a very high rate but their etiology remains
largely unknown. Using several conditional knockout mice, this project will reveal the downstream
signaling events of these two important pathways and how they interact with each other and the
androgen signaling pathway to regulate genital morphogenesis and masculinization. Our studies
will contribute greatly to the understanding of external genitalia development and the etiology of
hypospadias.","NIEHS","8265869","2/29/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01ES016597-04","5","R01","ES","016597","04"," ","SCHUG, THADDEUS","5/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","Urologic and Kidney Development and Genitourinary Diseases Study Section[UKGD]"," ","1974052","MA, LIANG ","Not Applicable","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","US","38.647241","-90.300814","9083901","WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY","SAINT LOUIS","MO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","631304862","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","113","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIEHS","226402","76448"," ","302850",

Similar to Estrogen action on bone remodeling, my studies have indicated that Endoxifen maintains/enhances overall bone formation via enhanced remodeling. These studies have the potential to identify Endoxifen as a novel, highly beneficial, therapeutic agent for osteopenia, osteoporosis and other bone related disorders, as well as breast cancer therapy

hindered by two major obstacles - a lack of lung organ donors and chronic rejection after transplanatation. We
will focus on rebuilding 3-D human lungs using ventilated, decellularized (i.e. all cells are removed) whole pig
lungs as a natural 3-D matrix framework that is very similar to human lung matrix in structure and function. We
will repopulate it with human adult stem cells having the potential to grow into lung tissue and produce proteins

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The surface of the small intestine is highly convoluted by finger-like projections called villi; this extended
surface area is critical for efficient nutrient absorption. Loss of intestinal surface area either by congenital
intestinal defects or by pathological or surgical events, can be life threatening. The ability to bioengineer the
intestine from its cellular components will require not only that we elucidate the molecular signals that are
important for morphogenesis and cell fate determination, but also that we understand the rules that govern the
patterning of the functional units that comprise the organ. Currently, little is known about how villi are
generated in utero. Through the study of mouse models with perturbed villus formation and through the
analysis of a novel intestinal explant culture system, we propose to dissect the molecular processes

Narrative
 Neural crest cell migration has been repeatedly likened to the process of metastasis and
invasion. However, although there is a wealth of research on the mechanisms that govern the
process of cell motility and invasion, we do not have much evidence showing that neural crest cells
undergo similar sub-cellular changes as those seen in cancer cells. The proposed research will
study in extensive detail the changes that trunk neural crest actin and tubulin cytoskeleton undergo
(polarizing, dynamics and leading edge formation) during chemoattraction to NRG1. The outcomes
from this research will help us understand how we may be able to harness the metastatic
aggressiveness of crest derived-cancers because it will look into the changes that allow neural
crest cells migrate throughout the embryo as it happens in adults suffering from these cancers.","NIGMS","8264740","4/2/2012 12:00:00 AM","PAR-08-028","5SC3GM096904-02","5","SC3","GM","096904","02"," ","OKITA, RICHARD T","6/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","ZGM1-MBRS-7(CG)"," ","8529324","DE BELLARD, MARIA ELENA","Not Applicable","30","BIOLOGY","055752331","LAGNHMC58DF3","055752331","LAGNHMC58DF3","US","37.215296","-119.663836","513617","CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NORTHRIDGE","NORTHRIDGE","CA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","913308232","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","859","Other Research-Related","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","75000","30880"," ","105880",

This is a proposal to study a gene named Pten which controls the number of
Progenitor/Stem cells in the lung. The studies address the specific role of Pten in a
serious lung condition known as Pulmonary Fibrosis for which no treatment currently
exists other than transplantation. The long-term goal of this project is to learn enough
about Pten to be able to modify its function and therefore prevent or treat lung disease.","NHLBI","8235057","3/26/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL056590-16","5","R01","HL","056590","16"," ","LIN, SARA","8/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-RES-B(02)M]"," ","1876418","MINOO, PARVIZ MINOO","Not Applicable","37","PEDIATRICS","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","US","34.065915","-118.196446","7636101","UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA","Los Angeles","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","900894304","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","247500","153450"," ","400950",

New targeted therapies are needed for cancer patients that improve survival and
decrease side-effects of therapy. Ewing's Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFT) are
highly malignant tumors of bone and soft tissue that occur in children,
adolescents, and young adults. The tumors often grow in close proximity to
bone, but can occur as a soft-tissue mass. Current standard therapy for ESFT
patients is a five-drug regimen that lasts for approximately 9 months. Patients
who present with localized ESFT have approximately 70% disease-free survival.
Patients who present with metastatic ESFT have a poor prognosis (20% disease-
free survival) despite intensive therapy. These clinical response rates have
persisted for the past decade, even after dose-intensifying chemotherapy and
bone marrow transplantation. The identification of a Ewing's Sarcoma Stem Cell
(ESSC) and elucidation of its properties will be critical to advancing both novel
and effective therapies into patients with ESFT. Our identification of ESSC along
with the use of a novel inhibitor of EWS-FLI1 are directly responsive to the RFA-
CA-08-019. This project will specifically address the need for new targeted
therapies for ESFT and potentially a large number of related malignancies that
have chromosomal translocations.","NCI","8314113","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-CA-08-019","5R01CA138212-05","5","R01","CA","138212","05"," ","STEELE, VERNON E","9/25/2008 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","ZCA1-RPRB-O(O2)"," ","6182845","TORETSKY, JEFFREY A","Not Applicable","98","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","049515844","TF2CMKY1HMX9","049515844","TF2CMKY1HMX9","US","38.904729","-77.016304","2869001","GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY","WASHINGTON","DC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","200570001","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","380355","77080"," ","457435",

By manipulating gene activity in the dermal papilla, we will identify the mechanisms by which the size of cell progenitor pools and their supporting niche populations are generated in the hair follicle, and how that dictates the size and shape of the hair. This research will have implications for the prevention of hair loss or restoration of defective hair follicles, and will also shed insight into the more general mechanisms that regulate organ size and shape.

Each year thousands of children are born with craniofacial diseases related to abnormal

regulatory molecules, are required for cranial bone formation. We believe that that
learning about functions of these molecules using sophisticated genetic and molecular

Narrative
Melanoma is notoriously resistant to conventional anti-cancer therapies, largely attributed to a subpopulation of
cells with stem cell-like properties known as melanoma-initiating cells (MICs). The purpose of this study is to
elucidate the mechanisms whereby MICs and their tissue environment collaborate to ensure survival and to

NARRATIVE
Vascular calcification in atherosclerotic plaques is a prominent feature of atherosclerosis, a major cause of
mortality and morbidity in the United States. We have demonstrated an essential role of Runx2 in vascular
calcification in vitro. This proposal will further characterize role of Runx2 in vascular calcification in vivo and
investigate the Runx2-regulated molecular signals in oxidative stress-induced vascular calcification. These
studies will provide important molecular insights into understanding the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, which
will leads to development of novel strategy or drugs for atherosclerosis prevention or therapy.

Public Health Relevance Statement
 The studies proposed will shed light on the process of tumor initiation and
progression and enhance our understanding of the molecular pathways involved in lung
cancer. The finding that Rac1b might function as an oncogene and that loss of Rac1 is
""lethal"" in the context of activated K-ras raises the possibility that targeting Rac1 in Ras-
mutated tumors would be therapeutically beneficial with, perhaps, limited toxicity towards
normal cells. Given the prevalence of Ras mutations in human cancer these finds could
potentially have an impact on a broad spectrum of cancers.","NCI","8509172","7/27/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","7R01CA124495-05","7","R01","CA","124495","05"," ","WATSON, JOANNA M","3/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Molecular Oncogenesis Study Section[MONC]"," ","7260889","KISSIL, JOSEPH ","Not Applicable","18","Unavailable","148230662","MGUCX773RNJ8","148230662","MGUCX773RNJ8","US","26.933813","-80.128954","10005569","SCRIPPS FLORIDA","JUPITER","FL","Research Institutes","334585284","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","75000","73500"," ","148500",

Narrative
This proposal investigates the contribution and clinical significance of decreased Rap1GAP
expression to the progression of human thyroid tumors. Studies in human thyroid tumor cell
lines will elucidate the mechanism through which downregulation of Rap1GAP attenuates
cell/cell adhesion and investigate whether loss of Rap1GAP enhances migratory and invasive
potential. Studies in human tumor specimens will identify the subtypes of thyroid tumors that
exhibit Rap1GAP downregulation, assess whether decreased expression of Rap1GAP is
correlated with the presence of metastatic disease at presentation, examine whether Rap1GAP
expression is further decreased in lymph node metastases compared to primary tumors and

Lay summary
Arterial calcification is one of the potential outcomes of blood vessel repair in
atherosclerosis, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and aging. Artery calcification
promotes mortality in these conditions and our objective is to identify new targets for
therapies. In this project, we will define and test proposed mechanisms whereby linked
changes in an enzyme (Vanin-1) involved in defense against oxidative stress, and the
gene expression regulator PPARgamma, promote arterial calcification by switching on
cartilage and bone formation in diseased arteries.","NHLBI","8291308","6/14/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL077360-08","5","R01","HL","077360","08"," ","FLEG, JEROME L","7/1/2004 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Atherosclerosis and Inflammation of the Cardiovascular System Study Section[AICS]"," ","8045873","TERKELTAUB, ROBERT A.","Not Applicable","52","Unavailable","933863508","E4SPG9ZLLE76","933863508","E4SPG9ZLLE76","US","32.871802","-117.231348","2908201","VETERANS MEDICAL RESEARCH FDN/SAN DIEGO","SAN DIEGO","CA","Research Institutes","921610002","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","222750","92664"," ","315414",

Project Narrative
This proposal originates from the recent discoveries by the Freeman laboratory that an actin-nucleating
protein, Diaphanous related formin-3 (DRF3), is an inhibitor of the ""amoeboid"" tumor phenotype and
that chromosomal loss at the gene encoding DRF3 occurs with high frequency in patients with
metastatic prostate cancer. DRF3 protein expression also declines with disease progression. The
mesenchymal-amoeboid transition (MAT) has recently been identified as a dynamic phenotypic
transition that can affect migration of tumor cells through matrices and reduce their sensitivity to
protease inhibitors. Our data indicate that DRF3 is positioned at a signal transduction node that controls
the MAT. Thus, DRF3 has the characteristics of a novel type of tumor- or metastasis-suppressor
protein. Our data suggest that this network is linked to anabolic lipogenesis, a feature of aggressive
tumor cells. The metabolic phenotype of tumor cells with amoeboid properties may make them
vulnerable to therapeutic interventions that target cholesterol or lipid metabolic pathways. Our goals are
to determine the biological consequences of DRF3 downregulation in prostate cancer, and to uncover
the MAT signaling network that responds to DRF3 silencing. These studies will provide new insight into
the relationship between membrane dynamics, lipid metabolism and castrate-resistant prostate cancer.
DRF3 loss and the MAT may also be functionally important in other solid tumor systems. Consequently,
these studies may provide information of more general significance to human cancer.","NCI","8206771","3/28/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","7R01CA143777-03","7","R01","CA","143777","03"," ","MOHLA, SURESH","8/15/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section[TCB]"," ","1883557","FREEMAN, MICHAEL R","Not Applicable","28","Unavailable","075307785","NCSMA19DF7E6","075307785","NCSMA19DF7E6","US","34.076546","-118.380008","1225501","CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER","LOS ANGELES","CA","Independent Hospitals","900481804","UNITED STATES","N","3/28/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","237409","159064"," ","396473",

Disorders most commonly associated with chronic alcohol consumption include alcoholic liver disease (ALD), pancreatitis, cardiovascular disease, endocrine dysfunction, osteoporosis, cancer, and immune dysfunction. It is still unanswered about what are the specific mechanisms by which alcohol induces developmental defects. This is important question to address in order for us to identify affected children at an early age and intervene to prevent or mitigate the damage. Outcomes from this proposal will significantly advance our understanding in human stem cell biology by elucidating epigenetic molecular signatures and pathways affected by alcohol exposure in human embryonic stem cells and human dental pulp stem cells. Stem cells may also prove valuable in developing therapeutic approaches for treating alcohol-induced physiological impairments and overt organ damage. Our understanding on the effect of alcohol on stem cells will be beneficial to design future clinical application of stem cells to improve human health.

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder caused by insufficiency of a blood clotting factor, designated factor VIII, for
which gene therapy offers a potential cure. However, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials showed that a major
limitation to a successful gene therapy treatment is the extremely poor expression of fVIII from the human fVIII
transgene, which we recently overcame by introducing a porcine fVIII transgene. We demonstrated that use of
the porcine transgene results in up to 100-fold greater fVIII production than the human version, and more
recently, we demonstrated that a similar differential is observed following gene transfer into blood stem cells
using recombinant retroviruses. Our current studies focus on better understanding the critical pharmacologic
parameters involved in generating curative fVIII levels with this procedure using a mouse model of hemophilia
A with the goal of understanding how this application can best be translated to clinical successes.","NHLBI","8230688","2/28/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL092179-04","5","R01","HL","092179","04"," ","LINK, REBECCA P","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","Gene and Drug Delivery Systems Study Section[GDD]"," ","2123578","DOERING, CHRISTOPHER BRADLEY","SPENCER, H TRENT","05","PEDIATRICS","066469933","S352L5PJLMP8","066469933","S352L5PJLMP8","US","33.762977","-84.42296","2384501","EMORY UNIVERSITY","ATLANTA","GA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","303224250","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","839","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","250000","137500"," ","387500",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Multiple myeloma is a B-cell malignancy characterized by the infiltration and growth of plasma cells in the
bone marrow. Patients with MM develop osteolytic bone disease permanently in the skull, ribs,
vertebrae, pelvis, and long bones of the limb, characterized by bone pain, pathologic fractures, and
hypercalcemia, making this a major cause of morbidity. Despite advances in chemotherapy regimens
used to treat patients with MM, the median length of survival after diagnosis of the disease is
approximately three years. Thus, newer therapies targeting multiple events of myeloma cell growth and
proliferation, including bone microenvironment and tumor vasculature need to be developed for
increasing patient survival. The central hypothesis of the proposed work is bone-targeted, genetically
engineered MSC therapy capable of inhibiting osteoclast activity by stable expression of OPG will be an
effective treatment for decreasing osteolytic bone lesions in MM. By combining the OPG therapy with

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The adult heart following a heart attack does not regenerate damaged muscle but forms a non-functioning scar
in the injured region. We have identified that a developmentally important molecule known as Wnt1 contributes
to scar formation in the injured heart. In this proposal, we will determine how Wnt1 regulates scar formation in
the injured heart and aim to minimize scar formation and improve cardiac function through manipulation of Wnt
signaling.","NHLBI","8268991","5/8/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL102190-03","5","R01","HL","102190","03"," ","SCHWARTZ, LISA","6/15/2010 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Myocardial Ischemia and Metabolism Study Section[MIM]"," ","8670141","DEB, ARJUN ","Not Applicable","04","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","US","35.926939","-79.038605","578206","UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL","CHAPEL HILL","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","275995023","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","247500","118800"," ","366300",

The proposed project is significant because Runx2 is required for osteoblastogenesis and Axin2 is a crucial negative regulator of the Wnt-2-catenin signaling pathway, which is a target for new anabolic agents. Because Axin2 is an intracellular inhibitor of 2-catenin and Lrp5 signaling, its activity could theoretically decrease the efficiency of emerging anabolic therapies that neutralize extracellular Wnt/Lrp5/6 inhibitors (e.g., anti-Sclerostin or anti-Dkk1 antibodies). An increased understanding of the interactions between Runx2 and Axin2 will have a collective impact because Runx2 and Axin2 also contribute to chondrocyte maturation and are tumor suppressors.

Narrative
Cleft palate represents one of the most common congenital birth defects in the human population. Despite
recent advancements in medical intervention, babies born with cleft palate often suffer multiple handicaps
that significantly compromise the quality of their lives. Significantly, mutations in the Transforming Growth
Factor-� (TGF-�) gene cause cleft palate in humans and mice. This research program is designed to
further our understanding of how aberrant TGF-� signaling may adversely affect cell fate determination
during palatogenesis and causes cleft palate. Ultimately, this investigation will provide important
information for the future prevention and treatment of craniofacial birth defects.","NIDCR","8281349","5/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R37DE012711-14","5","R37","DE","012711","14"," ","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","1/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","6378298","CHAI, YANG ","Not Applicable","37","DENTISTRY","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","US","34.065915","-118.196446","7636101","UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA","Los Angeles","CA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","900894304","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","340025","212716"," ","552741",

Project Narrative
Up to 30% of the extremely premature infants have chronic lung disease of prematurity, called
Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia. There infants are unable to oxygenate their blood adequately, which leads to
significantly increased life-long morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population. Though, at present, there
is no effective preventive or therapeutic intervention, the proposed studies are likely to establish the
effectiveness of curcumin, the active ingredient of the Indian spice turmeric, in effectively preventing
bronchopulmonary dysplasia.","NICHD","8206509","1/4/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-064","5R03HD067319-02","5","R03","HD","067319","02"," ","RAJU, TONSE N","1/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Pediatrics Study Section[CHHD-A]"," ","9871187","SAKURAI, REIKO ","Not Applicable","43","Unavailable","069926962","LTJVF4QSFCP9","069926962","LTJVF4QSFCP9","US","33.834898","-118.292983","2543101","LUNDQUIST INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION AT HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER","TORRANCE","CA","Research Institutes","905022006","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","865","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NICHD","50000","16500"," ","66500",

Project Narrative
The proposed research and training is relevant to public health because it addresses a poorly understood area
of pulmonary biology, namely the congenital anomalies of the upper airway. Conditions such as
tracheobronchomalacia can be so severe that may required intensive and expensive care. I will test a novel
hypothesis that paracrine Wnt signaling controls cartilage and muscle differentiation in developing conducting
airways. The findings from my proposed research will provide critical insights into the normal tracheal
development and the etiology of tracheomalacia. These studies will also provide a platform of knowledge
necessary for the development of novel therapies aimed at repairing damaged or malformed conducting
airways.","NHLBI","8367384","7/23/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-12-030","1K01HL115447-01","1","K01","HL","115447","01"," ","COLOMBINI-HATCH, SANDRA","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2017 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-F(M1)"," ","8759127","SINNER, DEBORA ","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","071284913","JZD1HLM2ZU83","071284913","JZD1HLM2ZU83","US","39.140882","-84.500494","615001","CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR","CINCINNATI","OH","Independent Hospitals","452293039","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","837","Other Research-Related","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","104071","8326"," ","112397",

Narrative
Cleft palate represents one of the most common congenital birth defects in the human population. Despite
recent advancements in medical intervention, babies born with cleft palate often suffer multiple handicaps
that significantly compromise the quality of their lives. Significantly, mutations in the Transforming Growth
Factor-� (TGF-�) gene cause cleft palate in humans and mice. This research program is designed to
further our understanding of how aberrant TGF-� signaling may adversely affect cell fate determination
during palatogenesis and causes cleft palate. Ultimately, this investigation will provide important
information for the future prevention and treatment of craniofacial birth defects.","NIDCR","8318935","11/10/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","3R37DE012711-13S1","3","R37","DE","012711","13","S","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","1/1/1999 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","6378298","CHAI, YANG ","Not Applicable","37","DENTISTRY","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","US","34.065915","-118.196446","7636101","UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA","Los Angeles","CA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","900894304","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","55416","34912"," ","90328",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Many of these diseases
originate at least in part from genetic defects that impact the development and maturation of the
cardiovascular system. Despite substantial progress in our understanding of cardiovascular
development and its role in disease susceptibility, much remains to be learned. The focus of this
proposal is on cardiac trabeculation, a fundamental aspect of cardiac development that modulates
cardiomyocyte mass and cardiac function. For example, defects in trabeculation have been associated
with some cases of Non-Compaction of the Left Ventricular Myocardium, a severe pediatric
malformation.
The proposed studies will help us understand cellular and molecular mechanisms of cardiac
trabeculation. Recently, Nrg/Erbb signaling has also been implicated in differentiated cardiomyocyte
proliferation and repair of heart injury (Bersell et al., 2009), and anticancer drugs targeted to the Erbb2
receptor frequently cause ventricular dysfunction (reviewed by De Keulenaer et al., 2010). Thus, by
investigating the downstream mechanisms of Erbb2 signaling in the heart, our studies should shed new
light on the action of this important signaling pathway in cardiomyocyte biology beyond trabecular
formation. Our studies will also generate new tools and reagents to investigate and manipulate
cardiomyocyte proliferation. Furthermore, they should help elucidate the critical, yet poorly understood,
role of cardiac function (via cardiomyocyte contractility and flow) in cardiac development.","NHLBI","8245686","4/9/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01HL054737-17","5","R01","HL","054737","17"," ","SCHRAMM, CHARLENE A","6/1/1996 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2016 12:00:00 AM","Cardiovascular Differentiation and Development Study Section[CDD]"," ","1891114","STAINIER, DIDIER Y","Not Applicable","12","BIOCHEMISTRY","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","US","37.78689","-122.448998","577508","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO","SAN FRANCISCO","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","941432510","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","250000","128721"," ","378721",

Akt is a protein that is often responsible for driving cancer cell growth, spread and
resistance to conventional and experimental therapies. Drugs that inhibit the
malignancy-associated parts of the Akt pathway may be very effective against glioma
tumors with decreased toxicity. Here we propose to identify 'arms' of the Akt pathway
that are specific to cancer cells and are ideal targets for developing effective molecular
therapies. We will also find ways to identify tumor subgroups that use different arms of
the Akt pathway and understand which proteins and pathways are active in tumor
subgroups.","NINDS","8288859","5/21/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-09-040","5K01NS064952-03","5","K01","NS","064952","03"," ","FOUNTAIN, JANE W","5/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","ZNS1-SRB-M(72)"," ","9369086","JOY, ANNA MARGARET","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","131606022","SKX6AXF9ZTM3","131606022","SKX6AXF9ZTM3","US","33.480398","-112.078774","2052813","ST.

Development of models that accurately reflect the metastatic competence of epithelial ovarian cancer
(EOC) represents a remarkable scientific challenge, because the EOC metastatic mechanism involves a
novel shedding of multi-cellular aggregates (MCAs) into a cavity (peritoneal cavity) as anchorage-
independent, chemotherapy-resistant spheroids. In this unique niche, molecular events that occur during
the transition from free-floating MCA to life-threatening peritoneally anchored metastatic lesion are poorly
understood. Understanding this transition will enable novel means of targeting intraperitoneal therapies to

 Project Narrative
Sex Steroids and Runx Signaling in Bone
This project will unravel fundamental mechanisms of osteoporosis that occurs as sex hormones decline. It is
based on the observation that Runx proteins, which control bone metabolism, interact with receptors for both
estrogens and androgens. The proposed work can ultimately lead to the development of improved drugs to
treat postmenopausal osteoporosis.

The etiology of lung disease often begins during embryonic development or early in life. To understand the pathogenesis of genetic, developmental, and acquired lung disease, to develop diagnostic criteria for these diseases, and to develop rational therapies, knowledge of the molecular, cellular and developmental mechanisms that regulate lung development is necessary. This proposal will focus on developmental mechanisms that involve Fibroblast Growth Factor 9, a signaling molecule that is essential for lung development and implicated as a pathogenic mediator of pleuropulmonary blastoma, a rare pediatric lung cancer.

Narrative - Health Relevance
Deregulation of Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and FGF signaling has been implicated in tumor-stroma
interactions, metastasis formation and tumor angiogenesis. This project will study a recently discovered
functional connection between MMP activity and FGF signaling that might be relevant in malignancy. The
potential tumor suppressive function of a specific inhibitor of FGF signaling, which is generated by MMP, will
be tested.

PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Cancer related deaths occur primarily because tumor cells spread from the site of origin to distant vital
organs using the circulatory system. In order to reach a distant organ, tumor cells have to mobilize
themselves and enter the circulation. The overall goal of proposed work is to develop mechanisms of
molecular intervention which immobilizes tumor cells and prevent tumor cell metastasis in cancer patients.","NCI","8196950","11/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA143081-03","5","R01","CA","143081","03"," ","AULT, GRACE S","12/7/2009 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","6784902","ZIJLSTRA, ANDRIES ","Not Applicable","05","PATHOLOGY","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","US","36.140134","-86.796274","8721001","VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY","Nashville","TN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","372032408","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","112714"," ","313989",

Statement of relevance to public health
The peripheral nervous system of vertebrates arises from two sources: ectodermal placodes and neural
cres cells and the neural crest is a multipotent stem-cell-like population that migrates extensively and
gives rise to an amazingly diverse set of derivatives. Similarly, placodes migrate or invaginate, and give
rise to sensory neurons of ganglia that innervate the face. Because placodes and neural crest-derived
cells are involved in a variety of birth defects (e.g. cleft palate, cardiac septal defects) and cancers such
as neurofibromatosis, melanoma, neuroblastoma, our results on the normal mechanisms of placode
and neural crest development provide important clues regarding the mistakes that may lead to
abnormal development or loss of the differentiated state.","NIDCR","8291090","5/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DE016459-12","5","R01","DE","016459","12"," ","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","8/20/2000 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Neurogenesis and Cell Fate Study Section[NCF]"," ","1858016","BRONNER, MARIANNE ","Not Applicable","27","NONE","009584210","U2JMKHNS5TG4","009584210","U2JMKHNS5TG4","US","34.134337","-118.126525","1073501","CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY","PASADENA","CA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","911250001","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","235125","145778"," ","380903",

Proper development of embryonic foregut derivatives is essential for mammalian survival at birth. The
rostral endodermal foregut tube divides into ventral respiratory (larynx and trachea) and dorsal alimentary
(esophagus and stomach) components. These must then develop into functional organs. Little is known
about the underlying mechanisms, despite their pragmatic importance. This proposal is for a research
project to dissect the roles of the Sonic hedgehog intercellular signaling pathway in mouse foregut
development. We elucidate critical roles in the initial compartmentalization of the common foregut tube,
and in the organ-specific differentiation of endoderm and mesoderm. Our results are of direct relevance to
the mechanisms of human foregut birth defects and potentially to the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer.","NIDDK","8314058","7/23/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01DK090468-03","5","R01","DK","090468","03"," ","CARRINGTON, JILL L","9/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Development - 1 Study Section[DEV1]"," ","1930665","KLINGENSMITH, JOHN A","Not Applicable","04","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","044387793","TP7EK8DZV6N5","US","36.006824","-78.924579","2221101","DUKE UNIVERSITY","DURHAM","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","277054673","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","205425","106825"," ","312250",

 Congenital craniofacial defects such as cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) are among the
most common birth defects in humans with high prevalence and a poorly understood etiology. The
current study is targeted to uncover the mechanisms of these congenital defects through genetic
manipulation of the morphogenetic Wnt signaling pathway in mutant animal models, which may
provide a basis for future translational applications.","NIDCR","8236888","3/28/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01DE021696-02","5","R01","DE","021696","02"," ","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","4/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-A(02)M]"," ","8651110","ZHOU, CHENGJI ","Not Applicable","03","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","047120084","TX2DAGQPENZ5","US","38.543675","-121.729989","577503","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS","DAVIS","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","956186153","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","250000","134688"," ","384688",

 Project Narrative
 We found that the EMT transcription factor, Slug, is upregulated in tumors and metastases in which N-
cadherin is upregulated. We believe that N-cadherin signaling through the FGF receptor induces a cascade of
events that leads to Slug induction, extravasation and metastasis. We will rule out the role of N-cadherin
adhesion in this process. We believe these studies will broaden our understanding of mechanisms that
regulate breast cancer metastasis and will provide insights into therapeutic application.","NCI","8213685","12/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA135061-04","5","R01","CA","135061","04"," ","AULT, GRACE S","3/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section[TCB]"," ","2268252","HAZAN, RACHEL B","Not Applicable","14","PATHOLOGY","110521739"," ","110521739"," ","US","40.851026","-73.844361","9433501","ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","BRONX","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","104611900","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","132842"," ","334117",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
This grant proposal aims to expand our understanding of stromal responses to cancer and, by finding new
genes and pathways involved in this response, identify new targets for tumor microenvironment-targeted
therapy. In addition to their use as prognostic markers, we believe that potential therapeutic targets may also
be discovered in the group of genes, especially those involved in ""cross-talk"" between cancer and stromal
cells. The fact that different carcinomas share expression of these targets would mean that large groups of
patients suffering from a variety of tumors could benefit.","NCI","8197004","12/6/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA129927-05","5","R01","CA","129927","05"," ","LIVELY, TRACY LUGO","1/10/2009 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","8748247","WEST, ROBERT B","Not Applicable","18","PATHOLOGY","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","US","37.429038","-122.178178","8046501","STANFORD UNIVERSITY","STANFORD","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","943052004","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","394","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","239407","138856"," ","378263",

Together, these diseases are highly prevalent in the human population and can have devastating consequences on life expectancy and quality from birth until senior age. Our studies are designed to increase understanding of the modes of action and regulation of Sox9, a protein with master roles in the control of genes required for cartilage development and function. We anticipate that the results of our studies will provide important new insights into mechanisms underlying cartilage diseases and will suggest novel, efficient ways to prevent and cure these diseases.

EMTs are extremely important for tissue remodeling during embryonic development, and
are also central events in several pathological processes, such as fibrosis, chronic
inflammation and cancer progression and metastasis. Elucidation of the molecular
mechanisms controlling EMT is critical for understanding these developmental and

TGF-ss signaling is a major tumor suppressor pathway in human carcinomas, but in later stages
of tumor progression, TGF-ss signaling promotes tumor progression. As systemic inhibitors of
TGF-ss signaling are in clinical trials in humans with cancer, it is important to delineate
mechanisms of both suppression and promotion of tumors by TGF-ss. We have excellent
mouse models and plans for such mechanistic studies.","NCI","8239934","5/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA085492-12","5","R01","CA","085492","12"," ","MOHLA, SURESH","5/20/2000 12:00:00 AM","2/29/2016 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","1877614","MOSES, HAROLD L","WEAVER, VALERIE MARIE","05","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","965717143","GTNBNWXJ12D5","US","36.140134","-86.796274","8721001","VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY","Nashville","TN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","372032408","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","323261","125044"," ","448305",

Project Narrative: One particular surprise from the last decade of developmental biology research is
that complex developmental processes in diverse tissues depend on just a few cell signaling pathways.
The hedgehog pathway plays a vital role at many steps in development and homeostasis of the
digestive tract and is also implicated in cancers of endodermally derived tissues. The functions and
mechanisms of hedgehog signaling in gut development are poorly understood, in spite of their useful
implications and applications for human gastrointestinal disorders. This proposal seeks to apply genetic
and cell culture tools to elucidate the precise role and mechanisms of hedgehog signaling in genesis of
the mouse stomach and intestine.","NIDDK","8314081","7/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK081113-04","5","R01","DK","081113","04"," ","CARRINGTON, JILL L","9/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Gastrointestinal Cell and Molecular Biology Study Section[GCMB]"," ","1893620","SHIVDASANI, RAMESH A","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","076580745","DPMGH9MG1X67","076580745","DPMGH9MG1X67","US","42.337844","-71.108337","1464901","DANA-FARBER CANCER INST","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","022155450","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","213172","156041"," ","369213",

Project Narrative: Cleft palate represents one of the most frequent human birth defects. This
complex birth defect is caused by both multigenic and environmental contributions. Despite the
frequent occurrence, relatively little is known about the developmental and genetic basis that
leads to a cleft palate formation. The growth factor plays vital roles in embryogenesis. Mutations
in several WNT growth factors have been associated with human cleft palate defect. This
proposal studies the role of Wnt signaling in the regulation of the palate development and
attempts to establish molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Wnt5a and its receptors
during palatogenesis. The results obtained from this study will provide fundamental information
for our understanding of cleft palate formation in humans, and provide an insight for the genetic
prevention and therapy of the human cleft palate.","NIDCR","8310779","8/9/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DE014044-10","5","R01","DE","014044","10"," ","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","1/1/2002 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1888311","CHEN, YIPING ","Not Applicable","01","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","US","29.935453","-90.123916","8424601","TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA","NEW ORLEANS","LA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","701185665","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","232774","114059"," ","346833",

Project Narrative:
SnoN is a potent negative regulator of transforming growth factor-� (TGF-�) signaling,
which play important but complex roles during mammalian tumurigenesis. It regulates
many aspects of cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, senescence and
motility and contains both oncogenic and anti-oncogenic activities. Identification of the
signaling pathways mediating each of these activities and deciphering the specificity of
these pathways are crucial not only for understanding the mechanisms controlling
malignant progression but also for development of novel cancer therapy that specifically
targets the oncogenic activity of SnoN while preserving its anti-oncogenic activity.","NCI","8270335","4/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA087940-09","5","R01","CA","087940","09"," ","SALNIKOW, KONSTANTIN","7/1/2001 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Molecular Oncogenesis Study Section[MONC]"," ","1897773","LUO, KUNXIN ","Not Applicable","13","BIOCHEMISTRY","124726725","GS3YEVSS12N6","124726725","GS3YEVSS12N6","US","37.870295","-122.268133","577502","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY","BERKELEY","CA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","947101749","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","157358","68762"," ","226120",

Project Narrative
Short bowel syndrome is an important cause of morbidity, mortality and health care
costs in the United States. Identification of therapies that enhance residual small bowel
function and ultimately encourage growth of new intestine are needed for treatment of
short bowel syndrome, regardless of the underlying etiology (e.g. from Crohn's disease
following resection, post-trauma, or vascular injury). The significance of our proposed
studies to health is that we have identified novel pathways that regulate the ability of the
intestine to grow and absorb nutrients. We have found that pathways regulated by tis7,
a gene that regulates transcription of other genes, can promote intestinal growth and
nutrient absorption and calorie storage. These observations may provide avenues for

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of gynecologic cancer death in the United States, and it is
responsible for the deaths of 16,000 women each year. Our group is developing a novel approach to treat
ovarian cancer by using measles virus strains that preferentially replicate in ovarian tumors. Based on
promising data deriving from a phase I trial of the MV-CEA measles strain in recurrent ovarian cancer patients,
in this application we seek to optimize delivery of the virus and weaken the immune response against the virus
in order to increase the efficacy of the treatment. Furthermore, we test the potential of the viral strain MV-NIS,
which allows imaging of the viral replication in the human body and use of radioactive iodine to augment the
therapeutic effect.","NCI","8249099","4/23/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA136547-04","5","R01","CA","136547","04"," ","SONG, MIN-KYUNG H","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Developmental Therapeutics Study Section[DT]"," ","6107734","GALANIS, EVANTHIA ","PENG, KAH-WHYE ","01","Unavailable","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","US","44.022374","-92.465881","4976101","MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER","ROCHESTER","MN","Other Domestic Non-Profits","559050001","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","335573","171478"," ","507051",

Over the past two decades, novel strategies using stem cell patches or injections have not been able to sufficiently remodel the tissue and restore its function, which may be in part due to their inability to address specific design criteria of the diseased niche, e.g. stiffness (denoted E); often the addition of adult stem cells into this niche results in stem cells responding to the environment rather than remodeling it, and as such, aberrant stem cell behavior occurs given that the niche is 3- to 4-fold too stiff, EInfarct, relative to healthy muscle, ECARDIO. Materials have also been proposed in conjunction with cells to treat MI, but they often do not adequately mimic native myocardial design requirements or use cells with sufficient capacity to remodel the niche. In response, we have engineering a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based material that has time-dependent crosslinking to specifically mimic how the myocardium stiffens from soft embryonic stem cells (ESCs), EESC, to the stiffer heart wall, ECARDIO; time-dependent stiffening induces cardiac progenitors to express 3-fold more mature cardiac markers versus static cultures. It also causes 85% of progenitors to form mature, contractile sarcomeres versus only 15% for static cultures. When combined with ESCs that are uniquely tuned to remodel and shape their niche as they develop, this HA- and ESC-based approach may be able to sufficiently protect ESCs as they develop, migrate into the scarred host myocardium, and subsequently remodel it to attempt to restore some level of contractile function. In this proposal, we will first study to what extent the engineered HA material enhances cardiac differentiation and matrix secretion, assembly, and remodeling in ESCs. After understanding this interaction and better, the combination will be introduced subcutaneously in a rat model to determine biocompatibility and then in used in a rat infarct model to assess its ability to improve cardiac outcome.

on lung epithelial cell repair, fibroblast recruitment to the lung and the development of alternatively activated

LIGHT, OX40L, and their receptors are expressed on the surface of many immune and some non-immune cells, and are thought to regulate the ability to mount certain immune responses. There is little known about the expression and activities of these proteins in human asthma and in clinical specimens from asthmatics of varying severity. By understanding where and when LIGHT and OX40L and their partners are expressed, 
and the functional importance of these interactions, we will gain knowledge that might lead to ways to therapeutically suppress asthma and fibrotic disease.","NIAID","8381193","7/26/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-AI-10-013","5U19AI070535-07","5","U19","AI","070535","07"," "," ","9/1/2006 12:00:00 AM"," ","ZAI1-PA-I","8294","1864857","CROFT, MICHAEL ","Not Applicable","52","Unavailable","804355790","UYTTZT6G9DT1","804355790","UYTTZT6G9DT1","US","32.881785","-117.236973","577507","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO","LA JOLLA","CA","Domestic Higher Education","920930621","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM"," ","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012","455458","455458"," ","376492","78966"," "," ",

Item 7. Project Narrative:
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the most frequent cancer to involve the skeleton, with up to 90% of patients developing bone
lesions that can result in severe bone pain and frequent pathologic fractures. Unfortunately, these lytic bone lesions rarely
heal even when patients are in long-term complete remission because of the permanent MM-induced block of osteoblast
precursor differentiation into functional bone-forming osteoblasts. This application proposes to investigate what intrinsic
changes to the osteoblast precursor are triggered by MM cells and are responsible for the selective differentiation block.","NIAMS","8290562","6/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR059679-03","5","R01","AR","059679","03"," ","SHARROCK, WILLIAM J","7/26/2010 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Structure and Regeneration Study Section[SBSR]"," ","2061215","GALSON, DEBORAH LYNN","ROODMAN, GARSON DAVID","18","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","US","40.444001","-79.956102","2059802","UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH","PITTSBURGH","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","152133320","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","227448","50155"," ","277603",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
 The dissemination of tumor cells to distant organs, or metastasis, is a deadly occurrence in cancer
progression, but its underlying mechanisms are still largely obscure. The present proposal will dissect a novel
pathway of metastasis, involving interplay between regulators of cell survival and cell adhesion. The results
may open new prospects for the treatment of metastatic cancer, which is currently incurable.","NCI","8242046","3/21/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA078810-15","5","R01","CA","078810","15"," ","WOODHOUSE, ELIZABETH","7/1/1998 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","1882783","ALTIERI, DARIO C","Not Applicable","03","Unavailable","075524595","DW1XZMGNFBL4","075524595","DW1XZMGNFBL4","US","39.950872","-75.195321","9340401","WISTAR INSTITUTE","PHILADELPHIA","PA","Research Institutes","191044265","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","178098","123600"," ","301698",

This project is aimed to provide better understanding of the mechanisms underlying some common cases of
medication-induced weight gain as an undesired side effect. Findings from this proposed study will provide
useful information to the clinical and public health professionals for improved care of patients who rely on these
medications, enhance our understanding of the regulation of fat tissue homeostasis, and help establish in vitro
testing modules for predicting potential toxicity effect of a wide range of existing and future drugs as well as
environmental chemicals.","NIGMS","8274627","6/13/2012 12:00:00 AM","PAR-08-028","5SC3GM094078-03","5","SC3","GM","094078","03"," ","OKITA, RICHARD T","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZGM1-MBRS-X(GC)"," ","9789785","ZHAO, YUANXIANG ","Not Applicable","39","BIOLOGY","028929438","JMGMMM7BMBT6","028929438","JMGMMM7BMBT6","US","34.049753","-117.815696","513608","CALIFORNIA STATE POLY U POMONA","POMONA","CA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","917682557","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","859","Other Research-Related","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","74250","31185"," ","105435",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Airway injury, manifested primarily by asthma, is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United
States. Diagnosis and management remain challenging due to the chronic repetitive nature of the disease that
leads to tissue remodeling. The proposal seeks to understand the link between the biological mechanisms that
trigger changes in the mechanical and optical properties in the airway mucosa. The results should provide a
platform for drug discovery and non-invasive diagnostics.","NHLBI","8300868","6/4/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL067954-09","5","R01","HL","067954","09"," ","NOEL, PATRICIA","8/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Lung Cellular, Molecular, and Immunobiology Study Section[LCMI]"," ","1912012","GEORGE, STEVEN CARL","Not Applicable","45","BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING","046705849","MJC5FCYQTPE6","046705849","MJC5FCYQTPE6","US","33.678042","-117.773718","577504","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE","IRVINE","CA","BIOMED ENGR/COL ENGR/ENGR STA","926970001","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","301243","142533"," ","443776",

In this project, an interdisciplinary team wil use a new model to fill this unmet clinical need in a common disease by increasing our understanding of how adaptive valve processes can become maladaptive, and will begin to test new therapies to reduce this complication that, if corroborated, can be rapidly translated to benefit patients.

One of the non-tumor cell types of the host that can actively contribute to the induction of new angiogenic blood vessels feeding the tumor is the inflammatory neutrophil, which can import molecules that directly induce the formation of new blood vessels and do so early on in tumor progression. The goal of the proposed research is to biochemically and mechanistically examine the pro-malignant role of the unique neutrophil enzyme, MMP-9, one of the few molecules released by neutrophils that is a potent inducer of angiogenesis and likely an inducer of tumor metastasis and thus could be therapeutically targeted in cancers associated with inflammatory neutrophil infiltration.

Project Narrative
Preterm delivery with resultant immature lungs (pulmonary hypoplasia) is a major
problem in obstetrics and accounts for more than 70% of perinatal mortality. In 2004,
12.5% of births in the United States were preterm. These immature lungs have reduced
numbers of mature epithelial cells which results in insufficient surfactant production (a
protein used to keep the distal airways open) as well as decreased vasculature. We
propose to utilize murine embryonic stem cells to derive distal airway cells for possible

PROJECT NARRATIVE
In the US, approximately 1 in every 2-3 individuals will develop cancer, a disease of uncontrolled cellular
proliferation that can be fatal. It is therefore very important to understand the basis of this disease in
order to be able to more effectively treat and cure it. This research aims to elucidate how p53, a gene
important for preventing cancer, acts, with the ultimate goal of devising better prevention and treatment
strategies for cancer.","NCI","8206557","1/4/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA140875-02","5","R01","CA","140875","02"," ","WATSON, JOANNA M","1/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Molecular Pathobiology Study Section[CAMP]"," ","1885021","ATTARDI, LAURA D","Not Applicable","18","RADIATION-DIAGNOSTIC/ONCOLOGY","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","009214214","HJD6G4D6TJY5","US","37.429038","-122.178178","8046501","STANFORD UNIVERSITY","STANFORD","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","943052004","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","207500","135490"," ","342990",

This loss results in Bruck syndrome and progressively deforming recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), a form of brittle bone disease. Through this research we hope to discover novel mechanisms of OI and commonalities that exist between various causes of OI, potentially leading to new targets for therapeutics.","NIDCR","8331763","7/19/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-11-111","5F31DE022483-02","5","F31","DE","022483","02"," ","FRIEDEN, LESLIE A","9/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","NIDCR Special Grants Review Committee[DSR]"," ","10345636","LIETMAN, CARESSA ","Not Applicable","09","GENETICS","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","US","29.711148","-95.39695","481201","BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","HOUSTON","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","770303411","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Training, Individual","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","43032"," "," ","43032",

Project Narrative
Brain tumors, especially glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are highly lethal. This project seeks to
understand cells that are found within GBM, sometimes called cancer stem cells, and how these cells differ
from patient to patient and how they resist conventional therapies, such as radiation and chemotherapy. In
performing these studies, we hope to develop better treatment strategies for GBM.","NINDS","8240707","3/29/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01NS052563-05","5","R01","NS","052563","05"," ","FOUNTAIN, JANE W","4/27/2006 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Basic Mechanisms  of Cancer Therapeutics Study Section[BMCT]"," ","1901449","KORNBLUM, HARLEY IAN","Not Applicable","33","PSYCHIATRY","092530369","RN64EPNH8JC6","092530369","RN64EPNH8JC6","US","34.104809","-118.41105","577505","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES","LOS ANGELES","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","900952000","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","853","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NINDS","218750","118125"," ","336875",

Project Narrative 
Cataracts are the most prevalent form of blindness worldwide.  In the USA, cataract removal is 
the most common outpatient surgical operation performed on the elderly costing over 343 
million dollars in 2005 (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicareMedicaidStatSupp/).  However, 10-
20% of elderly and nearly 100% of pediatric patients treated for cataract develop posterior 
capsular opacification (PCO) which requires additional treatments and can result in reduced 
visual outcomes.  Further, much effort is being exerted towards the development of intraocular 
lens (IOLs) implants that restore the ability of the eye to accommodate (establish near focus) 
after cataract surgery.  A major impediment to long term restoration of accommodation is that 
lens epithelial cells trapped at the lens equator by the IOL often regenerate the lens cortex which 
reduces the ability of the ciliary muscles to accommodate the implanted IOL.  This proposal 
addresses unanswered questions related to the molecular mechanisms of PCO development 
and lens fiber cell differentiation with the long term goal of preventing the side effects of 
cataract surgery.

ALI bears the hallmark of inflammatory infiltration and protein-rich edema fluid due to severe disruption of lung vascular endothelial barrier. Our studies will assess the effectiveness and mechanisms for that effectiveness of the transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), derived from mouse fibroblasts, and subsequently differentiated into endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These cells will be studied individually or in combination to see if they can reverse established lung microvessel injury that is induced by two sepsis mouse models and thereby re-establish normal lung fluid balance. We have generated these mouse progenitor and stem cells and found that we can readily expand them, a requirement for cell-based therapy. We hope by understanding the mechanisms of the protective effects of these easily obtainable progenitor cells to lay rigorous scientific underpinnings for the eventual use of defined iPSC-derived progenitor cells for the treatment of ALI in humans.

Relevance
As cell-in-cell structures are reported in a variety of cancers, such as breast, colon, and
lung, the elucidation of the entosis mechanism has the potential to uncover a previously
overlooked basic cell biological aspect of some of the most common, and deadliest
human cancers. Because the design of new cancer therapies is often tied to mechanistic
information about how cell death works in tumor cells, understanding entosis could
provide insight into new strategies for how these cancers might be treated.

This project focuses on the role of the Tbx18 transcription factor gene in development and maintenance of a healthy, functioning prostate. Our preliminary data show that Tbx18 is expressed in prostate from the earliest developmental stage, and that the dysfunction of this gene leads to abnormal development of the gland. We will use a combination of mouse genetics and genomic approaches to examine this developmental function in further depth, and to provide a mechanistic context for Tbx18 function by identifying genes that interact with Tbx18 and control its expression during urogenital development.

A thorough understanding of cell migration and invasion is essential for progress in diagnosis and therapy of
metastasis and other disease states in which cell migration or invasion is centrally involved. Moreover,
understanding the dynamic regulation of the cortical cytoskeleton at the cell's leading edge, whether in the
context of a migrating embryonic fibroblast, an advancing growth cone in a regenerating axon or a cancer cell
spawned by metastatic malignancy, is a major goal in cell biology with widespread implications in the study of
disease and development. We anticipate that our experiments will shed light on basic and conserved
mechanisms of cytoskeletal remodeling during various behaviors in diverse cell types.","NCI","8294993","5/18/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA151632-03","5","R01","CA","151632","03"," ","WOODHOUSE, ELIZABETH","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","7074498","EISENMANN, KATHRYN M","Not Applicable","09","BIOLOGY","807418939","M9ACC5DQCNL6","807418939","M9ACC5DQCNL6","US","41.62128","-83.615756","229501","UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS","TOLEDO","OH","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","436142595","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","100235"," ","301510",

The cortex, or outer region, of the adrenal gland produces steroid hormones throughout life; if hormone
production is disrupted due to genetic mutation, as occurs in about 1:15000 people, it is lethal without lifelong
daily hormone replacement therapy. This project will study the molecular mechanisms that maintain the cells
in the adrenal cortex that produce steroids. Greater understanding of these mechanisms may lead to improved
management of adrenal disorders and ultimately perhaps ways to treat patients by gene repair and cell
replacement therapy.","NIDDK","8280439","6/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK081515-04","5","R01","DK","081515","04"," ","SATO, SHERYL M","7/20/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology Study Section[MCE]"," ","6412130","LAUFER, EDWARD ","Not Applicable","13","PATHOLOGY","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","621889815","QHF5ZZ114M72","US","40.841253","-73.940404","1833205","COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES","NEW YORK","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","100323725","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","213172","130035"," ","343207",

Although several new drugs are currently available for the management of metastatic disease, these therapies can only extend the median survival by approximately 3 months at high cost, which poses a huge burden on patients, their families and the healthcare system. Given the promise of genistein as a safe, efficacious and cost-effective preventive agent that could be implemented before the development of metastasis, it is imperative to understand the molecular mechanism by which genistein inhibits prostate cancer metastasis. Our application will provide mechanistic basis and novel biomarkers for clinical investigation of genistein in the prevention of metastasis at early stages, which could significantly contribute to our efforts of reducing cancer mortality and improving healthcare in the United States and globally.

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The sense of taste is life-essential, in directing identification and ingestion or rejection of nutrients. Taste
buds reside, in the tongue, in taste papillae which are complex sensory organs. Thus developing papillae
contain cell and molecular information that ultimately determines taste bud formation. To understand the
developmental origins of nutrient selection, and the extent to which genetic makeup or early food
experience can determine food preferences and aversions, basic knowledge is needed about how the taste
papilla sense organs develop. It is necessary to know what periods of papilla development are rigidly
determined and what periods are vulnerable to influence from substances that cross the placenta after
maternal ingestion or access. Understanding the basic developmental biology of taste papillae also will
provide insight into formation of taste bud-sensory nerve interactions that set up the neural circuits for taste
sensation.","NIDCD","8277395","6/21/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DC000456-24","5","R01","DC","000456","24"," ","SULLIVAN, SUSAN L","2/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-IFCN-E(02)M]"," ","1861897","MISTRETTA, CHARLOTTE M","Not Applicable","12","DENTISTRY","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","US","42.244005","-83.73915","1506502","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR","ANN ARBOR","MI","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","481091276","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","173","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCD","203643","109875"," ","313518",

Abstract
Diarthrodial joints are lined by a highly specialized tissue called the synovium. In health, the synovial tissue is
thought to be the primary synthetic source of the viscous and lubricating synovial fluid that bathes the joint
tissues. Further, it is thought to provide nutritional support for the avascular cartilage tissue. In the context of
inflammatory arthritis, the synovial lining undergoes profound changes that include infiltration with bone
marrow derived lineages, hyperplasia and formation of a pathologic extension, termed 'pannus', that is thought
to contribute substantially to the destructive erosions evident in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Despite longstanding appreciation for these synovial functions in health and disease, there exists very little
understanding of the molecular regulation of synovial tissue behavior. The PI has a primary career focus on
understanding synovial physiology in health and pathophysiology in the context of arthritis. With a goal of
gaining insight into the molecular regulation of synovial tissue, we have examined mechanisms by which a
member of the cadherin family of homophilic adhesion molecules-cadherin-11-modulates behavior of the
predominant mesenchymal lineage of synovial tissue, the synovial fibroblast (FLS). In initial collaborative
studies, the expression and function of cad11 on primary human FLS was established. In recently published
work (Science 315:1006-1010, 2007), the PI and his colleagues demonstrated that cad11 is expressed on ex
vivo primary FLS (and not on bone marrow derived lineages) and functionally modulates adhesive, migratory
and invasive capacities of these cells. He also demonstrated that healthy cad11-null mice display a
hypoplastic synovial lining thereby providing prima facie evidence for the contribution of cad11 to regulation of
FLS behavior in the synovial tissue. Examination of arthritic activity in a mouse model of inflammatory arthritis
demonstrates an ameliorated inflammatory response in cad11 null mice thus illustrating a primary involvement
of the FLS lineage in the overall pathophysiology of inflammatory arthritis. These studies also showed that
cad11 null mice are significantly protected from synovial fibroblast mediated cartilage erosion via pannus
tissue. In aggregate, these seminal analyses establish a new paradigm for our perception of the joint lining
tissue in health and disease. Now, in ongoing studies of synovial fluid from patients with RA, we have
discovered substantial quantities of soluble cad11 thereby implicating cleavage of cad11 as an active
mechanism in RA disease physiology. In a 'bedside-to-benchtop' approach, we demonstrate that cad11 is
cleaved on synovial fibroblasts to yield a secreted form as well as potentially bioactive cell-associated cad11
fragments. Guided by recently published studies of E- and N-cadherin in other tissues and cell lineages, we
hypothesize that regulated cleavage may be directly involved in the molecular pathways regulating FLS (and
by implication, synovial tissue) function. This submission proposes a series of investigations to dissect the
regulation of cad11 cleavage and functional consequences of this cleavage in primary human synovial
fibroblasts. It is anticipated that this translational activity will expand our understanding of disease
mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis as well as provide rationale and context for development of therapeutics
directed at cad11 for patients with RA.","NIAMS","8247854","4/6/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR057382-03","5","R01","AR","057382","03"," ","MAO, SU-YAU","4/15/2010 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section[ACTS]"," ","1860775","BRENNER, MICHAEL B.","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","030811269","QN6MS4VN7BD1","030811269","QN6MS4VN7BD1","US","42.334978","-71.105987","1080401","BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021156110","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","216000","159386"," ","375386",

Project Narrative
 Mesenchymal growth factors, produced by tumor cells, activate their cognate receptors expressed in
surrounding stromal cells, mediating tumor-stromal interactions. These interactions are thought to be critical
for tumor progression at both the primary and the metastatic sites. A vast majority of prostate cancer (PC)
metastases occur at skeletal sites. The mechanisms underlying the marked propensity of PC to metastasize to
bone are beginning to be understood. Although still debatable, it is believed that cell surface and secreted
factors produced by the tumor cells induce an osteoclastic response, a critical initial step for PC growth in
bones. Bone resorption by osteoclasts results in the release of growth factors and cytokines from the bone
matrix, providing a favorable microenvironment for tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Bone formation
follows or accompanies bone destruction, and these bone reactions eventually become extensive enough to be
visible on radiographs as both sclerotic and lytic reactions. Increasing evidence suggests that platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF) mediates tumor-stromal interactions during human prostate cancer bone metastasis.
The goal of this project is to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which prostate carcinoma-produced
PDGF initiates bone remodeling, a critical event for tumor cell colonization to the bone. In this application, we
will test our hypothesis that the tumor-associated serine proteinase, matriptase, regulates the biological activity
of the newly discovered PDGF ligand, PDGF D, and that tumor-derived PDGF D regulates osteoclast
differentiation as well as osteoblast proliferation/differentiation critical for tumor cell growth.","NCI","8205007","1/4/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA123362-03","5","R01","CA","123362","03"," ","WOODHOUSE, ELIZABETH","1/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","1888624","KIM, HYEONG-REH CHOI","Not Applicable","13","PATHOLOGY","001962224","M6K6NTJ2MNE5","001962224","M6K6NTJ2MNE5","US","42.35738","-83.064737","9110501","WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY","DETROIT","MI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","482024000","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","104663"," ","305938",

I have chosen to study Ewing's sarcoma in this application since it represents a well characterized chromosomal translocation that generates a chimeric protein resembling oncogenic fusion proteins found in other types of cancer. In my practice here at Seattle VA Medical Center I have also encountered cases in which Ewing's sarcoma is found in older veteran patients. The lack of a relevant animal model is clearly a major impediment to understanding the molecular pathogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma and has contributed to the difficulty in turning the discovery of the t(11,22) translocation into a clinically relevant, detailed understanding of the mechanism of transformation. Establishment of a mouse model for Ewing's sarcoma will help to reveal how initiation and progression of Ewing's sarcoma occurs in vivo in a defined genetic setting, thus provide a useful platform to test new treatment strategies for Ewing's sarcoma.","VA","8243798","3/6/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-11-001","1I01BX001025-01A2","1","I01","BX","001025","01","A"," ","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Oncology A[ONCA]"," ","7742996","CHANSKY, HOWARD A","Not Applicable","09","Unavailable","020232971","W6J8APWKL9J1","020232971","W6J8APWKL9J1","US","47.563294","-122.312665","481094","VA PUGET SOUND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM","SEATTLE","WA","Independent Hospitals","981081532","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women in the United States. In fact, more
deaths will occur this year due to lung cancer than breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers combined. The
experimental strategies outlined in this project are designed to evaluate the contribution of the non-canonical
Wnt pathway to lung cancer and to identify genetic targets of this pathway that could be used to develop
potential small molecular therapeutic targets for the treatment of lung cancer.","NCI","8337394","8/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA138528-03","5","R01","CA","138528","03"," ","WOODHOUSE, ELIZABETH","9/2/2010 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Molecular Oncogenesis Study Section[MONC]"," ","3116287","WINN, ROBERT A.","Not Applicable","06","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","US","39.708143","-104.724958","1199905","UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER","Aurora","CO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","800452570","UNITED STATES","N","8/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","98528"," ","299803",

These cancer-hallmark processes include high levels of telomerase, whose enzymatic activity is known to be essential to maintain telomeres, which protect chromosome ends. The proposed research will pursue the currently emerging understanding that the roles of telomerase also extend to promoting other crucial, cancer- driving cell pathways, and is anticipated to generate new approaches for anti-cancer therapies.

Project Narrative
 With recent advances in imaging and genetics, malformations of the human brain are more frequently
recognized. These malformations cause neurodevelopmental and motor delays in affected children, yet we
know very little regarding which processes that go awry while the brain is developing or the underlying genetic
causes. This grant uses genetic manipulations in the mouse to define the organizational principles of the
embryonic stem cell populations that reside on the dorsal midline of the brain and generate vast numbers of
neurons in the adult brain responsible for memory and motor coordination. When these stem cell populations
develop abnormally, birth defects of the brain including cerebellar and cerebral malformations and
hydrocephalus result. An improved understanding of their basic developmental biology will ultimately lead to
improved diagnosis and eventually treatment for these devastating brain disorders.","NINDS","8311069","8/22/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01NS072441-03","5","R01","NS","072441","03"," ","RIDDLE, ROBERT D","9/30/2010 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Neurogenesis and Cell Fate Study Section[NCF]"," ","7138301","MILLEN, KATHLEEN JOYCE","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","048682157","SZ32VTCXM799","048682157","SZ32VTCXM799","US","47.663628","-122.283919","1531401","SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL","SEATTLE","WA","Independent Hospitals","981053901","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","853","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NINDS","245000","232750"," ","477750",

"No NIH Category available"," ","3D Acellular Vascular Beds: Characterization and Re-endothelialization"," As the organ wait list continues to exceed the number of donors each year, the need for alternative therapies to transplantation is becoming increasingly important. Yet, researchers have demonstrated that a vascular connection is necessary in order to maintain viability in tissues beyond 100-200 microns thick. To date, there is no effective manner in which to recreate this vascular connection. The goal of our proposed research is to develop three-dimensional vascular beds from natural tissues, which can ultimately be used in scaffolds for tissue engineering applications requiring immediate vascularization or which can be used as stand-alone grafts for necrotic tissues in the body. To create the vascular construct we will use a decellularization procedure, which we have previously developed to accurately preserve the intricate micro-architecture of peripheral nerve, to remove the immunogenic cellular components from highly vascularized lung tissue and to simultaneously preserve the microvessel extracellular matrix. The vascular bed will be subsequently re- endothelialized with human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that have been transdifferentiated into an endothelial cell phenotype. MSCs offer great potential for clinical translational because they are immune- privileged or they can be isolated from the patient. In addition, decellularized tissues offer clinical opportunities; in fact, most examples of current scaffold-based regenerative therapies utilize natural, acellular tissues (e.g., SIS products from Cook Biotech, AlloDerm from LifeCell, and Avance from AxoGen; note: the Avance nerve graft is based on the PI's decellularization processes for nerve tissue).

Project Narrative: The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis is one of the major
symptoms of TMJ disorders that occur highly frequently humans. TMJ ankylosis is
clinically characterized by the formation of bone or fibrous adhesion of the joint
components, which restricts the jaw movement and causes difficulty in feeding,
swallowing, and breathing. Congenital TMJ ankylosis have been repored, but very little
is known about the underlying genetic alteractions. A conditional inactivation of the
homeobox gene Shox2 in the TMJ cells in mice leads to abnormal formation and
ankylosis of the TMJ. Thus the conditional Shox2 mutant mice provide a unique animal
model for studying TMJ development and TMJ ankylosis. This proposal studies the role
of Shox2 in the TMJ development and its functional mechanisms using in vitro and in
vivo approaches. The results obtained from this study will provide fundamental
information for our understanding of the formation and function of this unique joint in
humans.","NIDCR","8204861","12/14/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DE017792-04","5","R01","DE","017792","04"," ","KUSIAK, JOHN W","1/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","1888311","CHEN, YIPING ","Not Applicable","01","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","053785812","XNY5ULPU8EN6","US","29.935453","-90.123916","8424601","TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA","NEW ORLEANS","LA","SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES","701185665","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","232774","114059"," ","346833",

Moreover, the aim of the study is to investigate the relevance of deregulated expression of Lin28B, EZH2, miR-200, and let-7 in archival human PCa tissue specimens to assess their roles in tumor aggressiveness in African American versus Caucasian-American patients.

Among the potential causes of stem cell incompetence in CKD we shall focus on a) stem cell-related factors and b) stem cell niche-related factors, as well as attempt pharmacologic correction of stem cell incompetence.

Project Narrative:
Our goals are to elucidate the mechanisms underlying Hirschsprung's disease and to
devise a method to provide functional innervation to the region of aganglionic colon.
These studies will benefit patients with Hirchsprung's disease and other gastrointestinal
motility disorders because providing functional innervation is a superior alternative to
surgical excision, which leaves patient with lifelonggastrointestinal problems. The
information gained here will also be relevant to transplantation of other tissues including
neurons.

There are many different drugs available for MM treatment, but due to the complexity of the disease, it is difficult for a clinician to choose the best treatment for a given patient.  We propose a novel combination of experimental and computational techniques to use information extracted from live cells and tissue samples from MM patients, to build personalized models of estimation of patient response to therapy.

In recent years MRSA infections have become common in outpatients of army community hospitals and among military recruits, in nursing home care units of VAMC and in Operation Iraqi Freedom troop population. Furthermore, MRSA infections are a major and growing cause of hospital-associated pneumonia in patients with trauma, surgery and spinal cord injury. The clinical management of empyema is associated with prolonged hospitalization, and instrumentation of the pleural space with significant patient discomfort. Here we propose two distinct treatment approaches; 1) via HO-1 induction by pharmacological means to prevent fibrosis in pleural empyema; and 2) via targeting miR-26a by intrapleural gene therapy to prevent fibrosis in pleural empyema. Currently there are no effective treatments for pleural fibrosis therefore the findings from these studies will move towards development of potential therapeutics against empyema and help to better manage empyema patients.","VA","8198367","12/9/2011 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-10-001","5I01BX000971-02","5","I01","BX","000971","02"," "," ","1/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Respiration[PULM]"," ","6858342","MOHAMMED, KAMAL A","Not Applicable","03","Unavailable","097378632","K9J8XA7VF6T7","097378632","K9J8XA7VF6T7","US","29.639112","-82.343305","481152","VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION","GAINESVILLE","FL","Independent Hospitals","326081135","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

Project Narrative:
The vast majority of breast cancer related deaths occur due to the spread of tumor cells
to distant organs, a spread that occurs via blood vessels or, particularly important for
breast cancer, via the lymphatic system. Surprisingly, however, very little is known
about the mechanism by which tumor cells promote new lymphatic vessel development
(lymphangiogenesis) and lymphatic spread. This proposal focuses on understanding a
new mechanism of lymphangiogenesis and breast tumor metastatic spread, via control
of VEGF-C levels by the Six1/Eya2 complex, and it lays the foundation for the
development of novel, anti-metastatic therapeutic agents that would target embryonic
proteins that are re-expressed in cancers, thus conferring limited side effects while
potently inhibiting breast cancer metastasis. )","NCI","8255466","3/21/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA157790-02","5","R01","CA","157790","02"," ","MOHLA, SURESH","4/8/2011 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","1889696","FORD, HEIDE L.","Not Applicable","06","OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","US","39.708143","-104.724958","1199905","UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER","Aurora","CO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","800452570","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","243500","124266"," ","367766",

Exposure to tobacco smoke is also associated with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), a characteristic feature of asthma. Asthma is a common self reported diagnosis in veterans and contributes significantly to healthcare utilization. In asthmatics, cigarette smoke exposure is often a trigger of cough and wheezing, both manifestations of AHR. Given the increased prevalence of smoking and asthma in veterans, it is important to understand the mechanisms behind cigarette smoke associated AHR. Nicotine, the addictive component of cigarettes, may play an important role in AHR through neurogenic mechanisms. This project is relevant to the VA population because it will improve current understanding of the neurogenic pathways involved in nicotine exposure and may uncover alternative therapeutic interventions to improve disease management for asthmatic veterans, including those who continue to be exposed to cigarette smoke.","VA","8245259","1/18/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-11-007","1IK2BX001306-01A1","1","IK2","BX","001306","01","A"," ","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Respiration[PULM]"," ","1947599","WONGTRAKOOL, CHERRY P","Not Applicable","04","Unavailable","824835805","JN4QJ2LB2S13","824835805","JN4QJ2LB2S13","US","33.801554","-84.309778","481023","VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION","DECATUR","GA","Independent Hospitals","300334004","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","999","Other","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

Project Narrative:
The vast majority of breast cancer related deaths occur due to the spread of tumor cells
to distant organs, a spread that occurs via blood vessels or, particularly important for
breast cancer, via the lymphatic system. Surprisingly, however, very little is known
about the mechanism by which tumor cells promote new lymphatic vessel development
(lymphangiogenesis) and lymphatic spread. This proposal focuses on understanding a
new mechanism of lymphangiogenesis and breast tumor metastatic spread, via control
of VEGF-C levels by the Six1/Eya2 complex, and it lays the foundation for the
development of novel, anti-metastatic therapeutic agents that would target embryonic
proteins that are re-expressed in cancers, thus conferring limited side effects while
potently inhibiting breast cancer metastasis. )","NCI","8396724","3/22/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","3R01CA157790-02S1","3","R01","CA","157790","02","S","OGUNBIYI, PETER","4/8/2011 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","1889696","FORD, HEIDE L.","Not Applicable","06","OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","041096314","MW8JHK6ZYEX8","US","39.708143","-104.724958","1199905","UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER","Aurora","CO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","800452570","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","33500","15370"," ","48870",

NARRATIVE
Gene activation in the blood vessel wall is controlled by protein:protein and protein:DNA complexes that are
necessary for rapid wound healing and tissue repair after infection or physical trauma. When these processes
become inoperative or dysfunctional in the cardiopulmonary system, excess scar tissue can accumulate and
stiffen very small blood vessels that eventually slows normal blood flow leading to clot formation, stroke, tissue
infarction (degradation), and sudden death. Protein complexes that control wound healing in the lung may be
faulty in patients with pulmonary hypertension which if untreated will eventually damage the right side of the
heart that functions as the blood pump to the lung. The proposed research will examine the protein
constituents of these regulatory complexes and determine if they are different in normal individuals compared
to patients diagnosed with end-stage pulmonary hypertension. The proposed research may lead to the design
of new treatment strategies for this devastating lung vascular disease that has no cure and only treatable by
performing lung transplantation surgery.","NHLBI","8335478","7/19/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-HL-11-032","5R03HL110802-02","5","R03","HL","110802","02"," ","MOORE, TIMOTHY M","9/23/2011 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","ZHL1-CSR-Q(S1)"," ","1922551","STRAUCH, ARTHUR ROGER","Not Applicable","03","PHYSIOLOGY","832127323","DLWBSLWAJWR1","832127323","DLWBSLWAJWR1","US","40.003166","-83.034278","6218701","OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY","COLUMBUS","OH","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","432101016","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","50000","26250"," ","76250",

This proposal asks how bone morphogenetic protein signals, which normally regulate the activity of 
progenitor cells involved in the repair of muscle, blood vessels, connective tissues, and bone, may 
become dysregulated to cause inappropriate bone formation in the human diseases of heterotopic 
ossification and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. In addition to providing insights into the 
mechanism of these poorly understood processes, these studies may identify much needed novel 
approaches for their management. These mechanisms have relevance to a broader set of conditions

The tendency of breast cancers to recur following treatment is the most important determinant of clinical
outcome, since recurrent breast cancer is typically an incurable disease. In this regard, a cardinal feature of
human breast cancers is the survival and persistence of residual tumor cells in a dormant state for many years
after successful treatment of the primary tumor. Since recurrent breast cancers invariably arise from
disseminated tumor cells, understanding their biology and identifying the molecular pathways responsible for
recurrence is an essential goal in breast cancer research. Achieving this goal will permit more effective
therapeutic approaches to be developed for the millions of breast cancer survivors at risk for recurrence.","NCI","8215925","3/16/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA098371-08","5","R01","CA","098371","08"," ","MOHLA, SURESH","4/18/2003 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section[TCB]"," ","1882180","CHODOSH, LEWIS A","Not Applicable","03","BIOLOGY","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","US","39.952982","-75.192768","6463801","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","191046205","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","210780","126468"," ","337248",

Developmental disorders of the brainstem and cerebellum - which are derived from the embryonic midbrain
and hindbrain - are a collectively important class of disorders that affect a minimum of 2.4 per 1000 resident
births based on data from the CDC. The true frequency is likely much higher. This large class of disorders
co-occurs with more common developmental disorders such as autism, mental retardation and some forms of
infantile epilepsy, and shares some of the same causes. We propose to find the causes of several different
types of brainstem and cerebellar malformations, which will contribute to more accurate diagnosis and
counseling in the short term, and to specific treatments for some of these disorders in the long term.","NINDS","8277226","7/4/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01NS050375-08","5","R01","NS","050375","08"," ","RIDDLE, ROBERT D","9/15/2005 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Developmental Brain Disorders Study Section[DBD]"," ","6096072","DOBYNS, WILLIAM B.","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","048682157","SZ32VTCXM799","048682157","SZ32VTCXM799","US","47.663628","-122.283919","1531401","SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL","SEATTLE","WA","Independent Hospitals","981053901","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","853","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NINDS","788287","306059"," ","798866",

Project Narrative
Wnt signaling plays a central role in development and in regulating the properties of stem cells. This research
focuses on deciphering the key target genes that change in hair follicle stem cells as they receive signals from
their surroundings, begin to proliferate and generate new hair growth. Gone awry, these mechanisms lead to
skin cancers. By unearthing the direct genes and mechanisms involved in normal stem cell activation, we are
likely to uncover new targets for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics.","NIAMS","8227956","5/18/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01AR031737-30","5","R01","AR","031737","30"," ","BAKER, CARL","1/1/1983 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2016 12:00:00 AM","Development - 2 Study Section[DEV2]"," ","1864075","FUCHS, ELAINE ","Not Applicable","12","BIOLOGY","071037113","LHGDNJMZ64Y1","071037113","LHGDNJMZ64Y1","US","40.762898","-73.95652","7056601","ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY","NEW YORK","NY","GRADUATE SCHOOLS","100656399","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","353518","243927"," ","597445",

Furthermore, the new knowledge will help us unravel signaling mechanisms of the Notch pathway in regulating FoxL2 gene expression governing levator M�eller smooth muscle differentiation during eyelid morphogenesis.

NARRATIVE
The long term objective of the application is to characterize the functional
interplay between the TGF-�1 and androgen signaling pathways that
independently of Smad effectors and in the context of tissue microenvironment
contribute to deregulation of TGF�1 mediated effects on prostate growth during
tumor initiation and progression. The application will also pursue the mechanism
converting TGF-� from a tumor suppressor in normal and benign prostate
growth, to a tumor promoter in advanced metastatic cancer.","NIDDK","8322333","8/9/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK083761-03","5","R01","DK","083761","03"," ","RANKIN, TRACY L","8/15/2010 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-DKUS-B(03)M]"," ","7875447","KYPRIANOU, NATASHA ","Not Applicable","06","SURGERY","939017877","H1HYA8Z1NTM5","939017877","H1HYA8Z1NTM5","US","38.042307","-84.458748","2793601","UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY","LEXINGTON","KY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","405260001","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","205425","95168"," ","300593",

7. Project Narrative
Patients infected with HIV-1 are prone to develop a rapidly progressing kidney disease
termed HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). HIVAN is the third leading cause of End-
stage renal disease among individuals with African American background, and is
associated with the highest rates of hospitalizations in this population. At present, there is
no specific treatment to cure this disease. Since activation of Renin-Angiotensin-
Aldosterone System plays an important role in the progression of renal diseases in
general, we intend to evaluate the effect of its inhibition in HIVAN. Our long term
research goal is to develop strategies to slow down the progression as well as find a
cure of this devastating kidney disease.","NIDDK","8304380","8/9/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DK084910-03","5","R01","DK","084910","03"," ","KIMMEL, PAUL","8/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","NeuroAIDS and other End-Organ Diseases Study Section[NAED]"," ","1863819","SINGHAL, PRAVIN C","Not Applicable","03","Unavailable","110565913","C5LHMPRJ9J19","110565913","C5LHMPRJ9J19","US","40.772985","-73.703245","4155008","FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH","MANHASSET","NY","Research Institutes","110303816","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","194901","128635"," ","323536",

NARRATIVE
Failure to properly heal wounds results in significant morbidity and mortality in many patients, particularly
those with diabetes, neuropathies, trauma and even those just advanced in years. Incomplete wound
resolution predisposes to ulcers and skin disruption, while excessive repair results in scarring which impairs
use and function. These investigations will define key extracellular and intracellular molecules that are
potential targets for rationally designed interventions to promote normal wound healing and limit scarring.","NIGMS","8319496","8/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01GM063569-08","5","R01","GM","063569","08"," ","SOMERS, SCOTT D","7/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-SBIB-E(02)M]"," ","1887605","WELLS, ALAN ","Not Applicable","18","PATHOLOGY","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","US","40.444001","-79.956102","2059802","UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH","PITTSBURGH","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","152133320","UNITED STATES","N","9/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","220523","113569"," ","334092",

become dysregulated to cause inappropriate bone formation in the human diseases of heterotopic 
ossification and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. In addition to providing insights into the

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related death in western countries, and metastasis is the primary
cause of death from lung cancer, which demonstrates a crucial need to better understand the biologic
underpinnings of metastasis. On the basis of the findings presented here, we postulate that tumor cells bind to
each other in a lock-and-key fashion through a receptor (Notch) that binds to its ligand (jagged2) on adjacent
tumor cells; Notch then suppresses the levels of a small RNA called miR-200, inducing a change in cell shape
and detachment from neighboring cells, an early event in metastasis. If proven true, these findings would
warrant studies to determine whether drugs that inhibit Notch receptors, which are currently in clinical trials,
prevent lung cancer metastasis and do so most effectively for tumors that have high levels of jagged2 and
Notch.","NCI","8241956","3/16/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA157450-02","5","R01","CA","157450","02"," ","KIM, KELLY Y","3/14/2011 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2016 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","1869259","KURIE, JONATHAN M","Not Applicable","09","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","394","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","237294","87435"," ","324729",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
During tooth development, the preodontoblasts polarize and elongate as they
mature to the secretory form and secrete collagen and a variety of
noncollagenous proteins. The major acidic phosphoprotein synthesized by the
odontoblasts is ""dentin phosphophoryn"" DPP. DPP is a highly acidic protein and
has been implicated to function as a regulator of mineral deposition during dentin
formation. In this proposal we intend to identify the mechanism by which DPP
functions in the extracellular matrix as a regulator of mineralization and
intracellularly as a cell signaling molecule. DPP mediated signaling can regulate
odontoblast proliferation and differentiation. Results from this study should help
us define the various functions of DPP, and its potential use in dentin
regeneration.","NIDCR","8269568","5/2/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DE019633-03","5","R01","DE","019633","03"," ","LUMELSKY, NADYA L","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-MOSS-B(02)]"," ","1867555","GEORGE, ANNE ","Not Applicable","07","DENTISTRY","098987217","W8XEAJDKMXH3","098987217","W8XEAJDKMXH3","US","41.880316","-87.687597","577703","UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO","Chicago","IL","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","606124305","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","247500","141075"," ","388575",

New technology developed by this research team uses bone marrow stromal cell-derived, living bone-ligament-bone templates to replace the injured ACL. Transplanted tissue does not survive long-term in the recipient (patient), but induces the regeneration of a new ligament made entirely of the patient's own cells! The regenerating ACL integrates into bone and forms a viable and mechanically appropriate replacement ligament. If these preliminary results are confirmed, we will be one large step closer to translating these results into a vastly improved human therapy. Further, understanding the mechanisms by which this regeneration occurs will open new avenues in the regeneration of musculoskeletal tissue.

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Glioblastoma multiforme is the highest-grade brain tumor and is a tremendously difficult
clinical problem. The current therapy is a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy with temozolomide, resulting in a 5% 5-year survival rate. We recently
discovered that inhibitors of the Notch signaling pathway enhance temozolomide
treatment of glioblastoma cell in culture. Our goal is to understand the underlying
mechanism, identity markers for responsive glioblastomas and translate these
observations to the clinic.","NINDS","8269695","5/17/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01NS021716-27","5","R01","NS","021716","27"," ","FOUNTAIN, JANE W","3/1/1988 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BDCN-W(03)M]"," ","1865029","ROSS, ALONZO H","Not Applicable","02","BIOCHEMISTRY","603847393","MQE2JHHJW9Q8","603847393","MQE2JHHJW9Q8","US","42.277722","-71.759339","850903","UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER","WORCESTER","MA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","016550002","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","853","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NINDS","214375","138272"," ","352647",

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, lethal interstitial lung disease. The sentinel morphological
lesion is the fibroblastic focus, which is composed of fibroblasts embedded in a type I collagen rich matrix.
Seminal studies have demonstrated that polymerized type I collagen acts as a negative regulator of fibroblast
proliferation. We have discovered that IPF fibroblasts have escaped this restraint. Our mechanistic studies of
this phenomenon point to aberrant proliferation signaling through the �1 integrin, involving the downstream
phosphoinositol 3-kinase/Akt - PTEN axis. The objective of this grant application is to characterize the
molecular mechanism by which �1 integrin-collagen interaction results in abnormal proliferative signaling in IPF
fibroblasts. It is our goal to uncover those components of the myofibroblast cellular machinery that result in
unrelenting fibrosis in IPF, and in proper tissue healing under normal circumstances. Identifying key regulatory
nodes controlling the pathologic behavior of IPF fibroblasts may provide molecular therapeutic targets to limit
the progressive fibrosis that characterizes IPF.","NHLBI","8269781","5/23/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL089228-04","5","R01","HL","089228","04"," ","EU, JERRY PC","9/4/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-RES-B(02)M]"," ","1903478","HENKE, CRAIG A","Not Applicable","05","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","555917996","KABJZBBJ4B54","US","44.974119","-93.227014","1450402","UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA","MINNEAPOLIS","MN","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","554552070","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","107330","54738"," ","162068",

 Project Narrative
 We found that R-cadherin is substantially downregulated in breast cancer. We have established a
series of in vitro and in vivo models to test tumor suppression by R-cadherin. Interestingly, R-cadherin and N-
cadherin are structurally very similar, yet display opposite effects on tumor progression. We have designed a
series of studies to study the role of R-cadherin loss in breast cancer progression and map the molecular
determinants that mediate its suppressive function as opposed to those that mediate tumor invasion by N-
cadherin. We believe these studies have the potential to broaden our understanding of mechanisms that
regulate breast cancer progression and have thus the potential to provide insights into therapeutic application.","NCI","8288276","5/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA136854-04","5","R01","CA","136854","04"," ","LIVELY, TRACY LUGO","7/22/2009 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","2268252","HAZAN, RACHEL B","Not Applicable","14","PATHOLOGY","110521739"," ","110521739"," ","US","40.851026","-73.844361","9433501","ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","BRONX","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","104611900","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","394","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","132842"," ","334117",

Relevance to public health (lay language): TGF-� is a protein which can be either helpful or harmful to human
health. While its ability to stimulate cell growth is important for normal wound healing, when unchecked the
function of many organs can be disrupted by scar (i.e., fibrosis) formation. Conversely, the growth inhibitory
actions of TGF-� are critical in preventing cancer. The proposed studies will identify/characterize targets which
can be used to either increase or decrease these responses.","NIGMS","8260318","4/27/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R37GM055816-16","5","R37","GM","055816","16"," ","MARINO, PAMELA","5/1/1997 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Cell Biology Study Section[TCB]"," ","1893649","LEOF, EDWARD B","Not Applicable","01","Unavailable","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","006471700","Y2K4F9RPRRG7","US","44.022374","-92.465881","4976101","MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER","ROCHESTER","MN","Other Domestic Non-Profits","559050001","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","225423","115191"," ","340614",

Project narrative
The mechanism of communicaiton between cells of the fruitfly Drosophila and humans is
well conserved and very similar. We make use of Drosophila to study how cell
communication affects cell movement. Lack of such communication can lead to severe
birth defects such as open neural tubes (e.g. spina bifida).","NIGMS","8306159","7/16/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01GM088202-04","5","R01","GM","088202","04"," ","HOODBHOY, TANYA","9/30/2009 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Development - 1 Study Section[DEV1]"," ","7896676","JENNY, ANDREAS ","Not Applicable","14","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","110521739"," ","110521739"," ","US","40.851026","-73.844361","9433501","ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","BRONX","NY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","104611900","UNITED STATES","N","8/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","859","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIGMS","196020","129373"," ","325393",

Conversely, skeletally mature animals and adult humans demonstrate an impaired ability to heal skull defects. While a plethora of strategies have been developed over the past century for treating adult calvarial defects, the myriad of methods currently available reflects the inadequacies of each therapeutic technique. By combining advances in developmental biology, organogenesis, stem cell biology, bioengineering, and material sciences, however, a new paradigm for calvarial bone tissue engineering has emerged - Regenerative Medicine. Despite accumulating evidence demonstrating the utility of human adipose derived stromal cells (hASCs) in regenerative applications, little is known about the heterogeneity that exists within the hASC population. By applying an information theoretic approach to cluster individual cells based on similar transcriptional profiles, it becomes possible it systematically interrogate a heterogeneous group of cells, such as hASCs, for functionally distinct subpopulations such as an osteoprogenitor population. This enriched population would be ideal to use for cell-based strategies for craniofacial skeletal regenerative medicine.

Project Narrative
While the role of acquired DNA methylation in gene expression changes is of obvious importance,
methylation events can play additional roles in the clinical assessment of tumors, providing potential
biomarkers to assess the onset and progression of disease, risk states, monitor prevention strategies,
provide early diagnosis and to track the prognosis of cancer. Our new observations in the regulation of
epigenetic changes provide potential markers for assessing susceptibility to malignant transformation in
individuals, as well as, potential targets for prevention and therapy.","NCI","8244511","3/21/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA097214-09","5","R01","CA","097214","09"," ","OKANO, PAUL","6/1/2003 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Genetics Study Section[CG]"," ","1863933","TLSTY, THEA D","Not Applicable","12","PATHOLOGY","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","094878337","KMH5K9V7S518","US","37.78689","-122.448998","577508","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO","SAN FRANCISCO","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","941432510","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","168624","85855"," ","254479",

Narrative
To date, the epithelial androgen receptor (AR) has drawn a lot of attention in prostate carcinogenesis and
there are thousands of publications focused on addressing the role of epithelial AR in prostate cancer. For
the stromal AR, there is still a lack of an in vivo model to investigate its impact on the BPH and prostate
carcinogenesis. The accomplishment of the studies could help to (i) uncover new insights about the cellular
functions of stromal AR, (ii) explore and understand the critical roles of the stromal AR in BPH and prostate
cancer initiation and progression, and (iii) could help to formulate new and alternative therapeutic strategies
by selectively targeting stromal AR and its downstream pathways to battle those two important prostate
diseases.","NCI","8213431","4/12/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA156700-02","5","R01","CA","156700","02"," ","MOHLA, SURESH","4/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","3/30/2016 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","7684977","CHANG, CHAWNSHANG ","YEH, SHUYUAN ","25","PATHOLOGY","041294109","F27KDXZMF9Y8","041294109","F27KDXZMF9Y8","US","43.16888","-77.615939","7047101","UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER","ROCHESTER","NY","SCHOOL OF MEDICINE & DENTISTRY","146270140","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","207500","113088"," ","320588",

Project Narrative
Endocrine therapy like Tamoxifen treatment remains important in premenopausal women with hormone
receptor positive breast cancer as it work best in women whose tumors are positive for estrogen receptor
(ER�) and unfortunately it is estimated that one third of women treated with Tamoxifen for 5 years will have a
recurrence within 15 years suggesting these are endocrine resistant tumors which represents about one-fourth
of all breast cancers. Silencing of hormone regulated genes in tumors are known to cause this resistance and
this pilot project will focus on the prevalence of the silencing of one of the hormone target genes (CD24) in
breast tumors compared to the surrounding normal tissues and its correlation to hormone receptor status.
Results from this pilot study will provide important data to plan future larger studies to better understand the
role of this silencing in therapeutic resistance and clinical outcome.","NCI","8212012","12/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","PAR-08-237","5R03CA150027-02","5","R03","CA","150027","02"," ","MARTIN, DAMALI","1/7/2011 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","ZCA1-SRLB-D(O1)"," ","10027528","KAIPPARETTU, BENNY ABRAHAM","Not Applicable","09","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","051113330","FXKMA43NTV21","US","29.711148","-95.39695","481201","BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","HOUSTON","TX","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","770303411","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","50000","28250"," ","78250",

 Project Narrative
Aging is associated with osteoporosis and with vascular (blood vessel) disease. In
addition, patients with osteoporosis (who have reduced bone) have an increased risk of
vascular calcification, which is associated with formation of bone-like structures in blood
vessels and with heart attacks and strokes. The proposed work focuses on the role of
circulating cells which likely arise from the bone marrow in initiating vascular calcification
as opposed to normal repair. These studies should help us better understand how
vascular calcification occurs, and perhaps ways of modifying the process into a more
normal repair process, which would have important implications for the prevention and
treatment of heart disease with aging.

Chronic fibrosis most commonly affects the liver, lung, kidney, heart, pancreas and skin and is the result of diverse causes such as autoimmune, genetic, idiopathic, or toxins (e.g. alcohol in hepatic fibrosis). These studies will determine the role of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in controlling the pro-fibrogenic functions of hepatic stellate cells, which are the principal fibrogenic cell type in the liver. This proposal focuses on identifying the mechanisms by
which CTGF production is regulated by small naturally occurring RNA molecules called microRNA. The relevance of these studies is that they will identify key steps in the pathways that lead to hepatic fibrosis and will define points of therapeutic intervention that exploit the central role played by connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in driving fibrotic pathology.

RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH
Nobody knows why each year up to 34,000 Americans develop idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis, ""IPF"", a lethal disease in which the lungs are slowly destroyed by scar tissue,
ultimately resulting in suffocation. Evidence suggests that in patients with IPF, certain
lung cells differentiate into scar tissue instead of growing normally. Using a unique
system of cultured human lung cells, we will examine how the information that is layered
on top of the genes (""epigenetic"" information) makes lung cells grow in normal as well as
abnormal ways, with the objective to develop new treatment and prevention strategies
for IPF and other lung diseases.","NHLBI","8336907","7/4/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-ES-10-002","5R01HL114094-02","5","R01","HL","114094","02"," ","GAN, WEINIU","9/23/2011 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2016 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-GGG-M(50)R]"," ","2194061","OFFRINGA, ITE A","BOROK, ZEA ","37","SURGERY","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","072933393","G88KLJR3KYT5","US","34.065915","-118.196446","7636101","UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA","Los Angeles","CA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","900894304","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","838","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","409428","262034"," ","671462",

Project Narrative
 We have discovered that a cell lineage called the mast cell can contribute to
inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by studying mouse models of disease. Now,
we have found that a protein made by mast cells, called tryptase, is among the means by
which mast cells impact disease. We are working out the mechanisms that tryptase
impacts to understand better how to target this novel pathway in treating people with RA.","NIAID","8277927","5/4/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AI059746-08","5","R01","AI","059746","08"," ","PEYMAN, JOHN A","4/1/2004 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Hypersensitivity, Autoimmune, and Immune-mediated Diseases Study Section[HAI]"," ","1876609","STEVENS, RICHARD L","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","030811269","QN6MS4VN7BD1","030811269","QN6MS4VN7BD1","US","42.334978","-71.105987","1080401","BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","021156110","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","855","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAID","247500","174859"," ","422359",

Novel approaches for chemoprevention of breast cancer are clinically attractive. Long-term objective of this research project is to develop a safe and inexpensive but effective regimen for chemoprevention of breast cancer using cruciferous vegetable constituent benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC). Research conducted in the previous funding period provided preclinical evidence for efficacy of BITC against breast cancer, but efficient translation of these
observations into a clinical setting depends on full appreciation of the molecular pharmacology of BITC. Clinical trial design without a full appreciation of the molecular pharmacology of BITC may be sub-optimal. Defining innovation of the current application includes translational merit of the proposed research as well as novel research directions.

As an alternative to donated organs, artificial tissue has yet to become clinically useful because we cannot meet the perfusion needs of bulk constructs post-implantation. Induction of blood-vessels within artificial tissues, which we propose to achieve using a novel biomaterials strategy, will overcome this deficiency by forming a perfusion-ready network and by enabling swift vascular integration upon implantation.

Arterial hardening in diabetes increases the risk for heart attacks & foot amputation. This
occurs in part via metabolic & inflammatory signals that induce bone-like calcification in

with calcification, fibrosis, and hardening of the arteries in diabetic mice. We test
whether regulation of these proteins reduces arterial hardening, decreases cardiac
workload, and improves blood flow to the foot.","NHLBI","8290230","5/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL081138-08","5","R01","HL","081138","08"," ","SRINIVAS, POTHUR R","9/30/2005 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","Atherosclerosis and Inflammation of the Cardiovascular System Study Section[AICS]"," ","1879402","TOWLER, DWIGHT A.","Not Applicable","01","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","068552207","L6NFUM28LQM5","US","38.647241","-90.300814","9083901","WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY","SAINT LOUIS","MO","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","631304862","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","147925","76921"," ","224846",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
Using a system of intravital microscopy to image live T cells within the inflamed dermis of a mouse, we have
observed two unique crawling phenotypes that were displayed by functionally distinct CD4+ T cell populations.
In the current research training plan, we will test whether the different crawling phenotypes observed utilize
unique molecular mechanisms in vivo. An understanding of mechanisms employed by functionally distinct
effector T cells could present means of preferentially manipulating subsets of tissue-resident effector cells,
potentially offering great therapeutic potential for many disease states.","NIAID","8261449","2/2/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-110","5F32AI089079-02","5","F32","AI","089079","02"," ","PROGRAIS, LAWRENCE J","2/14/2011 12:00:00 AM","7/20/2012 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-F07-C(20)L]"," ","9896927","OVERSTREET, MICHAEL GLEN","Not Applicable","25","MICROBIOLOGY/IMMUN/VIROLOGY","041294109","F27KDXZMF9Y8","041294109","F27KDXZMF9Y8","US","43.16888","-77.615939","7047101","UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER","ROCHESTER","NY","SCHOOL OF MEDICINE & DENTISTRY","146270140","UNITED STATES","N","2/14/2012 12:00:00 AM","7/20/2012 12:00:00 AM","855","Training, Individual","2012"," "," ","NIAID","27187"," "," ","27187",

In the adult intestine, myofibroblasts and myeloid cells are direct cellular targets of Hh signaling. These cells can modulate the inflammatory milieu and communicate with T-cells and are thus important integrators of inflammatory signaling. Indeed, preliminary studies indicate that Hh signals promote a tolerogenic phenotype in these cells. The goal of this work is to determine how Hh affects functional inflammatory signaling in myeloid cells and myofibroblasts. These studies will increase our understanding of how Hh influences intestinal immune responses, information that may be highly relevant to inflammatory bowel disease.

Narrative
The functional interaction between the cancer stem cells (tumor-initiating cells, TICs), and their
microenvironment, the ""niche"" will be investigated using a p53 null syngeneic transplantation mouse model, as
well as an established human breast cancer patient-derived xenograft model. Both in vivo and in vitro assays
will be applied in studying how the components of the niche microenvironment affect stem cells, and how the
deregulation of these interactions via genetic or epigenetic alterations may lead to tumor initiation. Insights into
niche-TIC interactions may provide new therapeutic targets for drug development with the goal of both
preventing breast cancer and reducing metastasis.","NCI","8528268","9/26/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-09-036","4R00CA142898-03","4","R00","CA","142898","03"," ","WOODHOUSE, ELIZABETH","9/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","NSS"," ","9610336","ZHANG, MEI ","Not Applicable","18","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","US","40.444001","-79.956102","2059802","UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH","PITTSBURGH","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","152133320","UNITED STATES","N","9/26/2012 12:00:00 AM","8/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","189325","59674"," ","248999",

 Craniofacial abnormalities account for approximately one third of all birth defects
in new born kids, are a major cause of infant mortality and dramatically impact upon
national health care budgets. Disorders such as Treacher Collins, Pierre Robin and
Waardenburg syndromes, along with holoposencephaly and craniosynostosis to name a
few, have serious lifetime functional, esthetic and social consequences that are
devastating to children and parents alike. Comprehensive surgery, dental care,
psychological counseling and rehabilitation help ameliorate the problems, but at a great
cost over many years. The Center for Disease Control estimates that the lifetime cost of
treating the children born each year with cleft lip and/or cleft palate alone to be $697
million. Post-natal treatment of malformation syndromes such as Treacher Collins
through comprehensive, well-coordinated and integrated strategies can provide
satisfactory management of each condition. However, the results are often variable and
rarely fully corrective, hence considerable effort needs to be invested into developing
therapeutic avenues of prevention. This can only come from a deep appreciation of the
precise etiology and pathogenesis of individual malformation syndromes, which is built
upon a thorough understanding of the normal events that regulate neural crest cell
patterning and craniofacial development.","NIDCR","8291876","6/11/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DE016082-08","5","R01","DE","016082","08"," ","SCHOLNICK, STEVEN","7/1/2004 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Skeletal Biology Development and Disease Study Section[SBDD]"," ","7840241","TRAINOR, PAUL ","Not Applicable","05","Unavailable","614653652","KNSQZPJ3K775","614653652","KNSQZPJ3K775","US","39.036373","-94.574439","4323301","STOWERS INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH","KANSAS CITY","MO","Research Institutes","641102262","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","247500","146025"," ","393525",

All present therapies for OA are targeted at symptoms, and none exists that can alter the degenerative course of the disease. Our study, by connecting joint development with OA degeneration, provides a novel perspective to study OA pathophysiology in which joints are not the passive ""victims"" of the degenerative force of inflammation but, rather make their own contribution to OA pathogenesis by a failure of an active cell joint population to maintain a controlled cytokine environment (such as MCP-5/MCP-1). The information derived from our studies has major medical relevance and implications as will provide critical insights into the chain of events that lead to OA and will point the research's direction to novel therapies

PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Obstruction of the kidney is a major clinical problem in both children and adults that results in progressive
and ultimately irreversible kidney damage. While increased expression of the inflammatory mediator,
interleukin 18 (IL-18), has been demonstrated in a wide range of kidney diseases, the role of IL-18 in
obstruction-induced kidney injury remains unknown. This investigation would provide novel insight into IL-18's

Narrative (relevance to public health).
Pancreatic cancer is a horrific disease with a very dismal prognosis. It constitutes the fourth leading
cause of cancer death in the US, and its yearly mortality equals the diagnosis rate. Novel therapeutic
options for this disease are sorely needed, and they are likely to result from new insights on the biology of
this disease. The Hedgehog signaling pathway involved in cancer of several organs, including the
pancreas. Inhibitors of the pathway are currently in clinical therapy for basal cell carcinoma. Although
several studies have addressed different aspects of Hedgehog signaling in pancreatic carcinogenesis,
we do not, at this point, know whether activation of this pathway is a limiting and required event in
pancreatic carcinogenesis. Our studies aim at understanding how the Hedgehog signaling pathway
promotes pancreatic carcinogenesis, and whether it would constitute a promising therapeutic target for
this disease.","NCI","8259535","4/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA151588-03","5","R01","CA","151588","03"," ","MIETZ, JUDY","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2015 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-DKUS-C(02)M]"," ","9699074","PASCA DI MAGLIANO, MARINA ","Not Applicable","12","SURGERY","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","073133571","GNJ7BBP73WE9","US","42.244005","-83.73915","1506502","UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR","ANN ARBOR","MI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","481091276","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","102226"," ","303501",

With approximately 200,000 newly diagnosed cases in the US per year, breast cancer is and remains a major
health issue. Even with the advanced treatment options available, 40,000 women die annually. Our project
aims at understanding how the architecture of the connective tissue scaffold in breast cancer is regulated and
how it affects cancer invasion and spread. The knowledge generated with this work may lead to novel
therapies that target the structure of this scaffold and prevent the escape of cancer cells.","NCI","8208079","3/16/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA107012-08","5","R01","CA","107012","08"," ","SATHYAMOORTHY, NEERAJA","3/1/2005 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","6380864","FRIEDL, ANDREAS ","Not Applicable","02","PATHOLOGY","161202122","LCLSJAGTNZQ7","161202122","LCLSJAGTNZQ7","US","43.068377","-89.40086","578503","UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON","MADISON","WI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","537151218","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","194203","94188"," ","288391",

Narrative
We will investigate the role of HIF2 in the tumorigenesis of LKB1-defective lung tumors. HIF2 has been shown
to be a bona fide oncogene in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and downstream mediators of HIF2 signaling are the
relevant therapeutic targets that have resulted in positive impact for RCC patients. Defining HIF2 as a critical
oncogenic mediator of LKB1-defective tumors will not only define an important deregulated signaling pathway
in the setting of LKB1 loss but also give strong preclinical rationale to the use of HIF inhibitors in LKB1-
defective lung tumors.","NCI","8225390","3/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA142794-03","5","R01","CA","142794","03"," ","SALNIKOW, KONSTANTIN","3/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2015 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Genetics Study Section[CG]"," ","6772358","KIM, WILLIAM Y.","Not Applicable","04","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","US","35.926939","-79.038605","578206","UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL","CHAPEL HILL","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","275995023","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","95315"," ","296590",

Although these women are at significantly increased risk for developing breast cancer, the connections between BBD and breast cancer progression have been largely understudied. Our colleagues have recently determined that failure to undergo normal, age-related breast involution is a significant factor in progression from BBD to breast cancer. In fact, all of the increased risk among women with BBD is associated with individuals who have failed to undergo a process known as lobular involution (LI). Evaluation of LI status is therefore a very important aspect of risk assessment among BBD patients. However, it is very difficult to quantify LI status using conventional pathological techniques, which involve counting the number of terminal duct lobules and scoring them for the extent of involution. This procedure is very subjective and requires a highly skilled pathologist with a lot of experience in assessing breast tissue structure. What are needed at this time are good molecular markers that can be used to quantify the LI status in women with BBD. Our objective is to identify small RNAs (microRNAs) that can be used to this end. We will initially use state of the art high throughput small RNA sequencing technology to identify and count all of the microRNAs in cells from involuted and non-involuted breasts. We will determine if there are microRNAs that are differentially expressed in such cells and tissues. We will determine if any of these microRNAs are functionally linked to the more cancer-like properties of cells from non-involuted breast tissues. In this manner we will identify microRNAs that can be used as quantitative markers of LI status and which may be mechanistically linked to breast cancer risk in BBD patients.

Public Health Relevance
The development of tumor metastasis continues to be the major limitation in our ability to control cancer and
improve survival. Metastasis depends on specific interactions between the cancer cells and the tissue barriers
they have to invade during dissemination. We have identified a unique interaction between enzymes that
degrades tissue barriers and a group of receptors that serves cells to attach. These receptors belong to the
family of receptor kinases that are potential therapeutic targets in cancer. Our studies unveiled a novel
functional relationship between the tissue-breaking enzymes and the kinase receptor that may regulate the
migratory and invasive activities of cancer cells. The studies of this application will focus on understanding this
relationship in normal and malignant breast cancer cells and in breast cancer tissues of human patients. We
expect that the information gathered from this application will contribute to the diagnosis of breast cancer and
to the design of new therapies aimed at controlling cancer dissemination.","NCI","8293054","4/4/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-10-067","5R01CA061986-17","5","R01","CA","061986","17"," ","SNYDERWINE, ELIZABETH G","7/6/1995 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2016 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Microenvironment Study Section[TME]"," ","1885137","FRIDMAN, RAFAEL A.","Not Applicable","13","PATHOLOGY","001962224","M6K6NTJ2MNE5","001962224","M6K6NTJ2MNE5","US","42.35738","-83.064737","9110501","WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY","DETROIT","MI","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","482024000","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","171284","89068"," ","260352",

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The essentially 100% occurrence of RAS oncogene mutations in pancreatic cancer argues that anti-Ras
inhibitors will be effective anti-cancer therapies for this deadline disease. In our studies we have identified a
key signaling pathway that is crucial for pancreatic cancer tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. Therefore,
we believe that our studies to better understand how this pathway, the RalGEF-Ral pathway, promotes Ras-
driven cancer growth will lead to our identification of novel drugs for the effective treatment of pancreatic
cancer.","NCI","8213560","3/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA042978-26","5","R01","CA","042978","26"," ","JHAPPAN, CHAMELLI","7/1/1986 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Molecular Oncogenesis Study Section[MONC]"," ","1860326","DER, CHANNING J.","Not Applicable","04","PHARMACOLOGY","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","608195277","D3LHU66KBLD5","US","35.926939","-79.038605","578206","UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL","CHAPEL HILL","NC","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","275995023","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","242097","114794"," ","356891",

identification of strategies that limit disease progression remains an important goal. This 
proposal will investigate mechanisms that regulate how supporting structural cells associate

The number of women in the US Armed Forces has increased from 2% to 15% and 7.4% of the veterans served by VA Hospitals are women. This proposal will investigate the role of tissue transglutaminase in metastasis and the survival of ovarian cancer stem cells.

A patient with PDAC has the worst survival rate of any solid tumor due to its late detection, early metastasis, and resistance to conventional chemotherapy. We have suggested that Cyr61 may be an early and late mediator of PDAC. This insight is developed from our recent findings which indicate that Cyr61 regulates Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) expression. Cyr61 promotes multiple crucial events associated with the progression of the disease and resistance to chemotherapy. The objectives of this project are to evaluate the mechanism whereby Cyr61 regulates SHh expression in pancreatic cancer, as well as uncover the mechanisms by which Cyr61 promotes tumor progression and metastatic growth to the distant organs. The role of Cyr61 in resistance to chemotherapy will also be evaluated. We are anticipating that the outcome of these studies will propose that targeting Cyr61 can provide a new treatment option for patients with pancreatic cancer.","VA","8242631","12/9/2011 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-10-001","5I01BX001002-02","5","I01","BX","001002","02"," "," ","1/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Oncology A[ONCA]"," ","7835883","BANERJEE, SNIGDHA ","Not Applicable","05","Unavailable","844272125","K2Q8HL5K1ZF2","844272125","K2Q8HL5K1ZF2","US","39.067164","-94.527526","481049","KANSAS CITY VA MEDICAL CENTER","KANSAS CITY","MO","Independent Hospitals","641282226","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

MM primarily affects older adults and it is more common in black populations than in Caucasians. Despite high- dose chemotherapy with stem cell support, MM remains incurable. Therefore, there is a significant need for continual efforts directed towards the development of novel and effective rational-based therapeutics for MM. Here, we propose to functionally characterize and validate as therapeutic target the BCL9 oncogene, a recently discovered transcriptional regulator protein that we have found to play important roles in the pathogenesis and progression of MM and colon carcinoma. The studies proposed in this RO1 are significant to Public Health in that they may lead to the development of novel pharmacologic strategies to treat MM and other cancers associated with deregulated Wnt signaling.","NCI","8260868","4/27/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA151391-03","5","R01","CA","151391","03"," ","HOWCROFT, THOMAS K","7/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Molecular Pathobiology Study Section[CAMP]"," ","6410805","CARRASCO, RUBEN D","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","076580745","DPMGH9MG1X67","076580745","DPMGH9MG1X67","US","42.337844","-71.108337","1464901","DANA-FARBER CANCER INST","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","022155450","UNITED STATES","N","6/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","5/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","144918"," ","346193",

Relevance to public health (lay language): TGF-� is a protein which can be either helpful or harmful to human
health. While its ability to stimulate cell growth is important for normal wound healing, when unchecked the
function of many organs can be disrupted by scar (i.e., fibrosis) formation. Conversely, the growth inhibitory

Project Narrative MicroRNA in Human Ovarian Cancer
Ovarian carcinoma is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies. Its high death rate is a result
of the fact that most patients (~75%) are diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease. Despite an initial response
rate of 65%-80% to first-line chemotherapy, most ovarian carcinomas relapse. Acquired resistance to further
chemotherapy is generally responsible for treatment failure, resulting in an overall 5-year survival rate of only
about 25% for late-stage ovarian cancer. Thus, there is urgent need to develop tumor markers for early detection
and identify novel molecules that are responsible for chemoresistance and ovarian cancer development, and thus
lead to new targeted therapy. We have recently identified frequent alterations of a class small nucleotides,
called microRNAs, in human ovarian cancer. Some of these microRNAs are involved in chemoresistance and
drive ""normal"" cells to malignant behavior. We also detected microRNA in human ovarian cancer plasma.
Based on these preliminary results, we will investigate if the microRNAs could be diagnostic/prognostic markers,
therapeutic targets and causal factors in human ovarian cancer. These studies will have significant impact on
ovarian cancer detection and treatment.","NCI","8257530","4/9/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA137041-04","5","R01","CA","137041","04"," ","ARYA, SURESH","6/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Basic Mechanisms  of Cancer Therapeutics Study Section[BMCT]"," ","2083857","CHENG, JIN Q","Not Applicable","14","Unavailable","139301956","DVHKP4N619V9","139301956","DVHKP4N619V9","US","28.062545","-82.419587","3736101","H.

During the last fifty years, the prevalence of these pathologies also increased in human populations, suggesting a link between BPA exposure and these outcomes. We observed that animals exposed perinatally to low doses of BPA developed mammary precancerous lesions. The proposed study aims at characterizing the mechanisms underlying this effect. This is of utmost relevance to the evaluation of BPA, a widespread contaminant found in 92% of the tested American population, and therefore it has the potential to greatly impact public health and public health policy. Additionally, this research promises to develop a method to assess the potential breast carcinogenicity of other toxicants.

Using our reported in vitro model system, we have provided strong preliminary data supporting the plausibility of further expanding human corneal endothelial monolayers by additional Kaiso siRNA knockdown with or without nocodazole. By switching on and off p120/Kaiso signaling, our novel engineering strategy may control cellular proliferation without disrupting their intercellular junctions, hence
avoiding both the use of enzymatically dissociated single cells and the risk of losing the normal cell phenotype to fibrous metaplasia. Such engineered grafts may one day be used to improve the surgical procedure of endothelial keratoplasty for restoring sight in patients suffering from bullous keratopathy due to dysfunctional human corneal endothelium. Furthermore, the said technology may also be applied to engineer other similar tissues, such as the retinal pigment epithelium, in the future.

Project Narrative
Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States, and metastasis is the
most common cause of death in lung cancer patients. New approaches are needed for the prevention of
metastasis in patients with lung cancer. Studies have shown that K-ras mutations are common in human lung
adenocarcinomas and are sufficient to initiate the development of lung adenocarcinomas in mice, but other
genetic events are required for the subsequent metastasis of these tumors. In this project, we will test the
hypothesis that inactivating mutations in MKK4, a gene that is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancer
types including lung cancer, promote the metastasis of K-ras-mutant lung cancer cells. We will examine
whether MKK4 inactivation causes these cells to develop the ""skills"" to metastasize, including the ability to
recruit inflammatory cells that promote cancer cell invasion and dissemination. If our findings support this
hypothesis, then clinical studies would be warranted to examine whether the presence of mutations in K-ras
and MKK4 together identify a subset of patients who are at high risk for metastasis and would benefit from
additional therapy to prevent disease recurrence.","NCI","8254442","4/5/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA105155-09","5","R01","CA","105155","09"," ","SALNIKOW, KONSTANTIN","2/1/2004 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Molecular Oncogenesis Study Section[MONC]"," ","1869259","KURIE, JONATHAN M","Not Applicable","09","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","5/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","4/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","158379","85525"," ","243904",

Project Narrative:
This is a competing renewal request for a project focused on identifying the role of Nf1 in
cardiovascular development and function. Our lab has shown that the gene causing
Neurofibromatosis, Nf1, functions in vascular endothelium and smooth muscle; and preliminary
data indicates that Nf1 is important in cardiac myocytes as well. We propose experiments to
elucidate the mechanism of Nf1 function in the cardiovascular system with implications for the
treatment of cardiovascular disorders in Neurofibromatosis, and for understanding of common
diseases such as hypertension and heart failure.","NHLBI","8242042","3/21/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL062974-13","5","R01","HL","062974","13"," ","SCHRAMM, CHARLENE A","7/8/1999 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cardiovascular Differentiation and Development Study Section[CDD]"," ","1876674","EPSTEIN, JONATHAN A.","Not Applicable","03","ANATOMY/CELL BIOLOGY","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","042250712","GM1XX56LEP58","US","39.952982","-75.192768","6463801","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA","PHILADELPHIA","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","191046205","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","247500","142313"," ","389813",

Metastatic disease is the principle cause of death from breast cancer. Molecular characterization of
this process is crucial to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic agents that will
alleviate patient suffering and increase the survival rate. In this research proposal, we will use
functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify the molecular changes that influence the
phenotypic characteristics of breast tumors, such as, changes in choline containing compound
levels, lactate levels, extracellular pHe, vascular volume and permeability surface area product in
Twist over-expressing breast cancer cells. Finally, the gene signature patterns of metastatic
progression identified using Twist over-expressing breast cancer cells in preclinical model will be
applied to patient samples in order to identify potential markers of breast cancer progression.","NCI","8207919","12/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA140226-03","5","R01","CA","140226","03"," ","JHAPPAN, CHAMELLI","3/10/2010 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Clinical Molecular Imaging and Probe Development[CMIP]"," ","6983512","RAMAN, VENU ","Not Applicable","07","RADIATION-DIAGNOSTIC/ONCOLOGY","001910777","FTMTDMBR29C7","001910777","FTMTDMBR29C7","US","39.329164","-76.617855","4134401","JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY","BALTIMORE","MD","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","212182680","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","128816"," ","330091",

 Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Ailawadi, Gorav
Project Narrative/ Relevance
There are no proven medical treatments to alter progression of aneurysm disease. KLF4 delays SMC
phenotypic switching to an inflammatory state in models of vascular injury. Furthermore, KLF4 is highly
upregulated in AA. Loss of KLF4 studies will allow us to determine the effect of KLF4 and SMC phenotype in
the progression of disease and determine if this is a potential therapeutic target to slow AA progression.

Project Narrative
Changes in HEF1 protein expression drive metastasis in more than 30% of human melanomas, and
have been linked to metastatic behavior in breast cancer. The proposed work will elucidate the action
of HEF1 in metastatic cancer progression, and reveal points of cancer cell vulnerability that can be
therapeutically exploited. Further, the proposed work will directly test existing, clinically validated
drugs targeting AurA and HDAC6 for effects on metastases formation, and may thus provide basis
for using these agents as new anti-invasive measures prior to tumor metastasis.","NCI","8215921","4/11/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA148671-03","5","R01","CA","148671","03"," ","JHAPPAN, CHAMELLI","4/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","9349618","PUGACHEVA, ELENA NIKOLAEVNA","Not Applicable","01","BIOCHEMISTRY","191510239","M7PNRH24BBM8","191510239","M7PNRH24BBM8","US","39.637631","-79.946405","9163701","WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY","MORGANTOWN","WV","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","265066845","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","393","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","93593"," ","294868",

Diseases such as cataracts and age-related macular degeneration significantly affect quality of life and represent sizable medical costs. The annual total outlay for cataract surgery each year in the U.S. is over $9 billion while the total costs of all services related to such visin problems is over $20 billion. Several experiments show that an antioxidant called N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) may delay the onset or halt the progression of these types of diseases. This research will test whether NACA in eye drop form can prevent and treat eye diseases such as cataracts and macular degeneration in animal models. Successful results from this study will support the advance of this medication into human use.

This work will utilize pan-HDAC, HDAC class, and individual HDAC small molecule inhibitors as well as mice genetically deficient in a variety of HDAC molecules to explore renal function after IRI in a murine renal ischemia model. Specifically, the proposed research will 1) define the HDAC class or individual HDAC molecule that participates in renal IRI, 2) determine the improvement in renal IRI tolerance that can be attained through selective and unselective HDAC inhibition, and 3) determine if the improvement in renal IRI tolerance brought about by HDAC inhibition acts on the renal parenchyma, the inflammatory response to IRI, or both. This knowledge has the potential to identify relevant targets for improving IRI responses that would have significant applicable benefit to human patients in organ transplantation, cardiac and cerebral ischemia, and cardiovascular surgery where IRI has significant clinical impact.

Project Narrative
This project explores a new therapeutic approach for malignant melanoma (the most
lethal form of skin cancer) that involves targeting a protein called MFG-E8. We have
shown that MFG-E8 functions to promote the growth of melanoma cells and to inhibit
protective immune responses against melanoma. Blocking the actions of MFG-E8 in
mouse models results in melanoma destruction. Work in this project will clarify the ways
in which MFG-E8 blockade accomplishes melanoma killing, which in turn should support
the development of MFG-E8 targeted treatments for melanoma patients.","NCI","8196804","11/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA143083-03","5","R01","CA","143083","03"," ","MCCARTHY, SUSAN A","1/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Transplantation, Tolerance, and Tumor Immunology Study Section[TTT]"," ","1885415","DRANOFF, GLENN ","Not Applicable","07","Unavailable","076580745","DPMGH9MG1X67","076580745","DPMGH9MG1X67","US","42.337844","-71.108337","1464901","DANA-FARBER CANCER INST","BOSTON","MA","Independent Hospitals","022155450","UNITED STATES","N","12/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","11/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","396","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","114727"," ","316002",

We anticipate that the clinical applications derived from the insights and knowledge provided by the successful completion of this research project will lead to molecular approaches to identify and target this lethal subpopulation of cells, which will improve treatment outcomes. In the long term, these studies will help characterize breast cancer initiating cells and provide insights that will contribute to the development of novel imaging markers and chemotherapeutic drugs for breast cancer.

Potential Impact on Veterans Health Care: Because knee ligament injuries which require surgical 
reconstruction are common in the VA patient population, this proposal has the potential to directly 
influence the lives of veterans and thereby enhance the quality of services provided by the VA. 
Although current methods for ACL reconstruction are successful at restoring stability to the knee, 
there are many side effects and risks to surgical reconstruction due primarily to the use of a graft 
which is needed to rebuild the injured ligament. In fact, many veterans with this injury are denied 
surgery for this problem and thus must decrease their physical activity level because the risk of 
morbidity from the graft harvest is not justified and there are not enough allografts currently 
available for everyone with this problem. At our VA institution alone, over 150 ACL reconstructions 
have been performed over the last 6 years. Thus, this proposal can improve the management of ACL 
injuries in veterans. In addition, basic methods of ligament and tendon tissue engineering developed 
in this study could be directly applied to other common clinical problems in which tendon or 
ligament tissue is absent or deficient. These problems include shoulder (rotator cuff) and knee 
(quadriceps and patellar) tendon ruptures, which are also common in the VA patient population. 
Furthermore, the results of this research could be applied to engineering of other connective tissues 
including other tendons, fascia, and skin. Thus, this proposal could ultimately result in substantial 
improvements in the quality of life of veterans.","VA","8195938","11/30/2011 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-08-001","5I01BX000126-03","5","I01","BX","000126","03"," "," ","4/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","Surgery[SURG]"," ","9443104","MCALLISTER, DAVID ","Not Applicable","33","Unavailable","066689118","DL46AKJ5YD48","066689118","DL46AKJ5YD48","US","34.104809","-118.41105","481012","VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM","LOS ANGELES","CA","Independent Hospitals","900731003","UNITED STATES","N","10/1/2011 12:00:00 AM","9/30/2012 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

The lymphatic vessels are similar to blood vessels but, instead of carrying red blood cells, white blood cells, oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, they carry the bulk of the immune cells responsible for the body's defense. Therefore, the function of the intestinal lymphatic system is closely related to the function of the gut immune system, and any abnormality of lymphatic function may impair the local immune response and cause gut inflammation. There are reasons to believe that the gut lymphatic system is overly extended in IBD patients, but its capacity to carry immune cells away from sites of inflammation is deficient. If so, an excessive accumulation of immune cells occurs in the tissue causing inflammation to linger, as typically seen in IBD patients. A series of experiments are therefore propose to understand why the lymphatic system fails to work efficiently in the gut affected by IBD, and what can be done to restore its normal function and eliminate inflammation.

7. PROJECT NARRATIVE
 Dominant gain of function mutations in FGFR2 accounts for majority of the human craniosynostosis
syndromes including Crouzon, Pfeiffer and Apert syndrome which are characterized by the premature fusion of
cranial sutures before the completion of brain growth. The goal of this proposal is to obtain a comprehensive
molecular picture of the signaling pathways that are activated in response to FGFR2 stimulation, which govern

Relevance to Public Health
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common cancer of the head and neck.
Advanced SCC with metastasis is often incurable and possesses poor prognosis.
Hepatoctye growth factor (HGF) has been found to play an important role in SCC
metastasis by stimulating the invasive growth of SCC cells. The long-term objectives of
this application are to understand why head and neck SCC and other malignant cancers
frequently leave their original site and spread to local and distant organs. In this
application, we will examine how HGF stimulates invasion and survival of SCC cells by
inducing new gene expression. We will determine whether HGF target genes are
abnormally expressed in human SCC tumors and are associated with metastasis. New
findings from this study will help us to develop novel strategies for treating SCC and
other human cancers.","NIDCR","8269541","1/27/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01DE015964-09","5","R01","DE","015964","09"," ","VENKATACHALAM, SUNDARESAN","4/1/2004 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2015 12:00:00 AM","Tumor Progression and Metastasis Study Section[TPM]"," ","2234578","WANG, CUN-YU ","Not Applicable","33","DENTISTRY","092530369","RN64EPNH8JC6","092530369","RN64EPNH8JC6","US","34.104809","-118.41105","577505","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES","LOS ANGELES","CA","SCHOOLS OF DENTISTRY/ORAL HYGN","900952000","UNITED STATES","N","3/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","2/28/2013 12:00:00 AM","121","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDCR","343846","114324"," ","458170",

Mitochondria participate in a number of essential functions in the cell including energy production, protein and amino acid synthesis and programmed cell death (apoptosis). The mitochondrial genome consists of a circular mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 16.5 kilobases which codes for 37 genes. There are also approximately 1500 mitochondrial genes in the nuclear DNA, involved in a myriad of essential cellular functions such as signaling, cell growth and differentiation and apoptosis. Germline and somatic mitochondrial genome variants and mutations have been identified in a number of different cancers. However, very few studies have investigated the mitochondrial genome in EOC. We have previously performed a study looking at genetic variants around the whole genome in women with ovarian cancer compared to those who do not have the disease. Some of the most significant associations with ovarian cancer are in mitochondria-related genes. Furthermore we have previously looked at some genes related to the mitochondria and found some associations with ovarian cancer. The GOAL of the proposed study is to more comprehensively investigate mitochondrial genome variation in ovarian cancer. We will look both in the germline and tumor DNA. Nuclear mitochondrial gene variation, mtDNA haplotype analysis and correlative somatic mtDNA studies will be performed. These studies will enable us to fully evaluate the HYPOTHESIS that inherited variation in the mitochondrial genome as well as the nuclear genome should be considered as factors for risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. We have the following specific aims: 1) Stage 1 - To investigate SNPs in nuclear mitochondrial-related and mtDNA genes Approach: We will look at the results of the nuclear mitochondrial-related and mtDNA genes from the oxidative phosphorylation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, protein synthesis and apoptosis pathways. Then for those genes that are significantly associated with ovarian cancer we will expand the coverage on genes in our chosen pathways in a study population of 2000 EOC cases and 2000 controls. Additional mtDNA SNPs will be included to ensure identification of the most common mtDNA haplogroups. We will use statistical analysis to look for SNP associations within major histologic subtypes and tumor characteristics. 2) Stage 2 - To validate the top hits in nuclear mitochondrial-related genes and mtDNA genes in an independent case-control collection Approach: We will validate the SNPs showing the most statistically significant associations with ovarian cancer (approximately 40 SNPs) in a collection of up to 10000 ovarian cancer cases and 10000 frequency matched controls from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). Furthermore we will include mtDNA SNPs that define the most common mtDNA haplogroups. We will then use logistic regression to investigate the association of mtDNA haplogroups and histologic subtype and perform exploratory gene-environment interactions with non-genetic risk factors. 3) To identify mtDNA mutations and variants in EOC Approach: We will undertake mtDNA sequencing in ovarian tumor tissue in a subset of 400 ovarian cancer cases from the above panel. Sequencing will be performed using the Affymetrix MitoChip v2.0. Variants and mutations will be investigated in germline DNA of the same individual . We will investigate if particular mtDNA haplotypes are correlated with somatic variants or mutations in ovarian tumor tissue or particular variants are associated with tumor-specific characteristics. In this unique and powerful study we will investigate the impact of variation in the mitochondrial genome and variation of the nuclear genome on ovarian cancer risk. The preliminary data for this study comes from two ovarian cancer GWASes in over 8000 individuals which provides an immense resource upon which to build this study so as to make strides in ovarian cancer genetic research. The epidemiologic and genotype datasets are readily available, and are currently housed at the Moffitt Cancer Center which proves the feasibility of the proposed research. The blood DNAs and tumor specimens/blocks are also readily available for this study. The proposed work is scientifically sound, highly significant and novel. Our research team is highly skilled and has been working together successfully for many years in ovarian cancer SNP association studies as is evidenced by our joint publications and funding record. We will address several priorities established by the National Cancer Institute-convened Gynecologic Cancers Progress Review Group including (1) application of novel study designs to elucidate the genomics of ovarian cancer, and (2) systematic screening of germline genetic targets with translational impact. Finally, this study will address a number of the questions on the role of mitochondria in cancer that were posed in the program announcement (PA-08-143).","NCI","8212214","2/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-143","5R01CA149429-03","5","R01","CA","149429","03"," ","VERMA, MUKESH","4/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Epidemiology of Cancer Study Section[EPIC]"," ","8218685","PHELAN, CATHERINE ","Not Applicable","14","Unavailable","139301956","DVHKP4N619V9","139301956","DVHKP4N619V9","US","28.062545","-82.419587","3736101","H.

NARRATIVE
HIF-2� increases the growth and aggressiveness of specific tumor types such as kidney and brain cancers.
HIF-2� is also required for the survival of cancer stem cells, which allow a tumor to reappear after it has been
treated by chemo/radiotherapy or surgery. We propose to screen the NIH compound library for drugs that
specifically inhibit HIF-2� activity by using our cell lines which contain a HIF-2� reporter and whose activity will
be blocked by potential HIF-2� inhibitors. To evaluate whether these inhibitors may become useful anti-cancer
drugs, we will also test their ability to inhibit tumor progression in other cell-based models.","NIDA","8262506","1/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","PAR-09-129","1R03DA033980-01A1","1","R03","DA","033980","01","A","SINGH, HARI","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Special Emphasis Panel[ZRG1-BST-F(50)R]"," ","10775792","KOH, MEI YEE ","Not Applicable","09","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","800772139","S3GMKS8ELA16","US","29.706319","-95.397195","578407","UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR","HOUSTON","TX","HOSPITALS","770304009","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","279","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","OD","25000","14500"," ","39500",

Our long-term objective is to develop less expensive, more effective synthetic bone graft substitutes for use in orthopedic applications. We hope to develop a family of bone growth factor or BMP/TGF-b (bone morphogenetic protein/transforming growth factor-beta)-binding materials that can be employed in clinical situations where there is a need to retain the growth factors at the skeletal site where they are implanted in order to enhance their activity and promote bone growth and the successful integration of bone grafts or artificial joints into the skeleton.

Decreases in T cell immunity are a direct consequence of age-related thymic degeneration, and
are linked to a host of undesirable conditions, including increased risk of infection, increased
severity of infection, decreased response to vaccinations, decreased tumor surveillance,
increased autoimmunity, and so on. Regenerating the thymus is therefore of significant interest
to human health. This application proposes a novel approach to understanding the biology of
regrowth of the atrophied thymus. In addition to an in-depth understanding of the regrowth
process, this project is expected to ultimately reveal potential new targets for thymic
regeneration therapy.","NIA","8220866","2/6/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AG031576-04","5","R01","AG","031576","04"," ","FULDNER, REBECCA A","2/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cellular Mechanisms in Aging and Development Study Section[CMAD]"," ","1877910","PETRIE, HOWARD T.","Not Applicable","49","Unavailable","781613492","PHZJFZ32NKH4","781613492","PHZJFZ32NKH4","US","32.903152","-117.243436","7375802","SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE","LA JOLLA","CA","Research Institutes","920371000","UNITED STATES","N","2/15/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","866","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIA","195076","191174"," ","386250",

The research program aims to establish the implications of EGFR and hedgehog cascades and other
interacting pathways in the malignant transformation of PC stem/progenitor cells and their progenies
and treatment resistance and validate novel therapeutic targets for improving current therapies and
preventing disease relapse and the death of PC patients. The studies will consist to delineate the gene
products modulated through the EGFR and hedgehog pathways that can cooperate in PC progression and

 Narrative
The proposed research in this application is designed to address and define the causal role of
AhR in invasive breast cancer progression. Results from these studies will help identify the AhR
as one of the breast cancer metastatic determinants; thus establishing it as an independent
survival prognostic factor for breast cancer. The studies will also lead to a better understanding
of the molecular action of AhR and its ligand-independent activation in advanced breast cancer,
thus providing a unique target for the design of novel selective inhibitors for therapeutic
intervention of metastatic breast cancer.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and the most lethal primary brain tumor. Despite advances in a variety of therapies, survival has remained largely unchanged for more than 30 years. The invasion of GBM into healthy brain tissues is the main reason for disease intractability. It is unclear why GBM tumor cells invade. However, there is compelling evidence that suggests the accumulation of specific serum proteins in the extracellular space due to disruption of the blood-brain-barrier may make GBM tumor cells more invasive. Serum proteins have not previously been recognized as modulators of invasion. The identification of specific serum proteins that actuate GBM cell migration would establish new therapeutic targets directed at preventing the spread of GBM tumor cells throughout the brain. By stopping the migratory behavior of GBM, therapies directed at bulk tumor growth may prove more effective and survival from this devastating disease may improve for the first time in many decades.

Project Narrative 
This proposal will determine if the loss of activity of the nuclear receptor, PPAR, is the cause of permanent 
hair loss in scarring alopecia. It will also determine whether the xenobiotic response receptor, AhR, has a role 
in inhibiting PPAR. PPAR has broad-range effects in controlling inflammation and regulating lipid 
metabolism. Because this nuclear receptor is important for normal hair follicle health, understanding its 
regulatory mechanisms and target effectors provides a basis for targeted therapy in hair and cutaneous 
diseases.

Project Narrative
Overall, these studies represent pre-clinical testing of the LOX-PP protein, a novel suppressor of Ras
signaling, in breast cancer. The rs1800449 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) results in an Arg-to-Gln
variant in LOX-PP and in substantially reduced Ras suppressing activity and increased risk of ER� negative

Colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer related mortality within the United States. Because of the burden of disease associated with colorectal cancer, the VHA has issued specific directives (VHA Directive 2007-004) describing colorectal cancer prevention and control best practices for the VA. Despite these aggressive screening programs, which are clearly intended to identify disease at treatable stages, colorectal cancer is diagnosed in 4500 veterans and 650 of these are stage IV disease. We have identified a tight junction associated protein that appears to suppress cancer function. We are just barely beginning to understand the biology of this protein. Understanding its function may illuminate unrealized aspects of tumor biology. We hope to develop this protein as a diagnostic marker or druggable target in colorectal cancer, and possibly other tumor types.","VA","8332389","7/12/2012 12:00:00 AM","RFA-BX-11-014","1I01BX001426-01A1","1","I01","BX","001426","01","A"," ","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2016 12:00:00 AM","Oncology A[ONCA]"," ","7056252","WILLIAMS, CHRISTOPHER S.","Not Applicable","05","Unavailable","156385783","M4CNTUL3N9L7","156385783","M4CNTUL3N9L7","US","36.142612","-86.804682","481084","VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION","NASHVILLE","TN","Independent Hospitals","372122637","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","999","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",

Project Narrative
 High blood pressure is major contributor to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The number of ESRD
patients treated by either dialysis or transplantation has more than doubled in the period from 1991 to 2004
from 209,000 to 472,000. In the next 20 years, the numbers of ESRD patients are expected to increase to
over 2 million. Additionally, the economic impact is substantial, burdening the Medicare system (costing
$20.1 billion or 7% percent of total Medicare expenditures), and the private insurance sector (estimated at
$12.1 billion). The unfortunate reality is that treatment options are limited and only slow the progression of
the disease. The focus of the proposed work is to identify genes that predispose the Dahl salt-sensitive (S)
rat to develop hypertension-induced kidney disease. Previous genetic analysis using the S rat identified
several chromosomal regions linked to kidney disease. In particular, a region on rat chromosome 2 was
found to play a significant role in the kidney injury observed in the S rat. The homologous region on human
chromosome 1q21 has also been linked to kidney disease in multiple studies. This underlies the importance
in identifying the gene in the rat because the findings may be readily applied to human kidney disease. In
summary, it is the goal of this proposal to utilize a rodent model of human disease and advanced genetic
techniques to expedite the identification of a gene involved in kidney disease. The application of knowledge
gained from this research will contribute to a better understanding of the how and why of the disease and
ultimately provide earlier and more effective treatments of the disease before kidney failure is reached.","NHLBI","8289584","5/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01HL094446-04","5","R01","HL","094446","04"," ","OH, YOUNGSUK","8/1/2009 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2014 12:00:00 AM","Hypertension and Microcirculation Study Section[HM]"," ","7888323","GARRETT, MICHAEL R","Not Applicable","03","PHARMACOLOGY","928824473","X59NJBFL8BJ3","928824473","X59NJBFL8BJ3","US","32.328724","-90.175537","5390304","UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR","JACKSON","MS","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","392164500","UNITED STATES","N","7/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","6/30/2013 12:00:00 AM","837","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NHLBI","247500","122513"," ","370013",

characterized by the aberrant gene expression and the inability of cartilage chondrocytes 
to repair the extracellular matrix leading to cartilage degeneration. CD-RAP is a small 
cartilage-characteristic protein that is co-expressed in cartilage with type II collagen and

PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE
Clinical trials have demonstrated that the effects of conventional and investigational cancer therapies are
remarkably heterogeneous, and efforts are currently underway to match therapies to the specific molecular
features associated with responsiveness to them in an effort to better exploit their effects (""personalized
medicine""). The overall goal of the research proposed here is to better understand the mechanisms involved in
cell killing induced by two promising classes of investigational cancer therapies (proteasome inhibitors and
histone deacetylase inhibitors) so that the promising effects of these drugs that have been noted in preclinical
models can be best exploited in patients. We will be directly comparing the effects of two proteasome inhibitors
and three HDAC inhibitors that are either already FDA-approved, being evaluated in clinical trials, or being
developed for clinical application in humans, and in our third Specific Aim we will develop and apply

We have published that DEK supports the initial stages of cancer development, and generated the first preclinical model systems in which therapeutic DEK targeting approaches can now be tested. These models include organotypic epithelial rafts, human xenografts and DEK knockout mice. DEK inhibition selectively targeted epithelial tumor cells: acute DEK depletion caused the death and chemosensitization of cancer cells. However, DEK depletion did not affect normal cells to the same extent, and left differentiated cells which comprise the majority of human epithelium unaffected. HNC is a devastating disease with poor survival, and new approaches to diagnose and treat this disease are urgently needed. Preliminary data herein support critical roles for DEK in HNC growth, and also invasion and thus cancer cell dissemination. Thus DEK might be targeted in advanced cancers which are responsible for the great majority of HNC-related deaths. The application determines the role of DEK in the activation of b-catenin signaling pathways which we believe are a major contributor to HNC growth and spread in the human body. We anticipate that the results of the proposed studies in HNC will have broad implications for all cancers in which DEK is overexpressed. Based upon our preliminary and published findings, we postulate that DEK will be a useful diagnostic marker, and that its targeting - perhaps in conjunction with conventional chemotherapies - will improve therapeutic outcomes at both early and late cancer stages.

NARRATIVE
Progressively growing tumors are supported by additional cell types that are collectively called the
stroma. Stromal cells include vascular endothelial cells and pericytes that are required for the
construction and maintenance of the tumor blood supply. Since stromal cells are normal and not subject
to the genetic instability common to cancer cells, they provide a static target for the development of
therapeutic agents. Over the past decade, therapeutic targeting of the tumor vasculature has become
increasingly attractive, leading to the development of small molecule and antibody inhibitors. Clinically,
these agents normalize the tumor vasculature and when applied alone or in combination with other
drugs, such as chemotherapy, they have resulted in anti-tumor effects in patients with cancer.
Unfortunately, as these drugs are applied systemically, there are substantial side effects in patients that
preclude their chronic administration. An alternative to these modalities are vaccines designed to elicit
specific T cell responses against antigens expressed by cells making up the tumor vasculature. Based
on our preliminary data, such vaccines provide potent anti-tumor protection and do not target normal
tissue vasculature, making them both effective and safe. Since such T cells may be renewed periodically
by booster vaccination, they may provide novel and potent inhibitors of tumor growth. The studies we
propose will assess the safety and efficacy of this modality in a mouse model that approximates the
human immune system. These results may provide the translational inertia to develop vaccine and
combinational therapies targeting the tumor stroma that can be applied to patients harboring any type of
vascularized cancer.","NCI","8213498","2/24/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01CA140375-03","5","R01","CA","140375","03"," ","MUSZYNSKI, KAREN","4/1/2010 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2015 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Immunopathology and Immunotherapy Study Section[CII]"," ","1942504","STORKUS, WALTER J.","Not Applicable","18","DERMATOLOGY","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","004514360","MKAGLD59JRL1","US","40.444001","-79.956102","2059802","UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH","PITTSBURGH","PA","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","152133320","UNITED STATES","N","2/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","1/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","395","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NCI","201275","95165"," ","296440",

We propose to investigate the molecular events in sequential biopsies taken from these patients, which will elucidate the variations induced by therapy in proliferating and cancer stem cells. This project is based on preclinical work conducted in the applicant's laboratory that identified cancer stem cells as responsible for resistance to anti-EGFR therapy. For this he utilized a novel direct patient tumor model he has devised implanting patient head and neck cancers in mice. These stem cells were then characterized molecularly and compared to non-progenitor cells, which led to the identification of the Hedgehog pathway as 500-fold more expressed in these progenitor cells. A combination containing a drug inhibiting this pathway (IPI- 926) achieved tumor cures and a reduction in the number of precursor cells in animal models. This supports translating these findings to the clinic. The first unique feature of this proposal is the utilization of a direct patient tumor model that allows the preservation of all the compartments that constitute a tumor. The second is the integration of laboratory observations and clinical research, since the applicant works with IPI-926 in his laboratory as well as leading the first-in-human Phase 1 study of IPI-926 in patients with solid tumors. It is that integration that permits an efficient translation such as this cancer stem cell-specific therapy. This proposed clinical trial represents truly hypothesis-driven drug development and applied translational science.

The current studies will examine the therapeutic potential of anti-�2-microglobulin (�2M) monoclonal antibodies 
(mAbs) in myeloma. We recently made a novel and exciting discovery that anti-�2M mAbs had strong apoptotic 
activity in myeloma cells, and were also active and therapeutic in vivo in xenograft mouse models of myeloma. 
The mAbs selectively target and kill myeloma cells in coculture with normal hematopoietic cells without 
damaging normal blood cells. Moreover, our preliminary studies showed that anti-�2M mAbs may also be able 
to inhibit myeloma-mediated bone destruction in patients. Thus, we hypothesize that anti-�2M mAbs may be 
used as therapeutic agents to treat patients with myeloma. We propose a series of experiments to examine the 
mechanisms of mAb-induced apoptosis in myeloma cells, to elucidate the mechanisms of anti-�2M mAb- 
mediated protection of myeloma bone disease, and to develop strategies to enhance the efficacy of the mAbs

myeloma and may provide another avenue for augmenting currently available therapies for treating myeloma

PROJECT NARRATIVE
The discovery of COX-2 and subsequent development of specific COX-2 inhibitors
represented an enormous conceptual advance in eicosanoid biology and opened new
possibilities for pharmacologic treatment of inflammation and pain. It is clear, however,
that COX-2-specific NSAIDs have their own toxicities. The finding of a PGE synthase
isoform induced during inflammation and required for high level PGE2 production
represents a conceptual advance of similar magnitude. In view of the existence of
multiple PGES enzymes and other PG subclasses, the specific role of mPGES-1-derived
PGE2 in inflammation and autoimmunity remains uncertain. Furthermore, information on
the biology that will inform the development of mPGES-1 as a therapeutic target remains
incomplete. It is our expectation that our work will yield new insights into the role of PGs
in the functioning of eicosanoids during initiation and resolution of inflammation and the
transition from the innate to the acquired immune response.","NIAMS","8209253","2/7/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-07-070","5R01AR049010-08","5","R01","AR","049010","08"," ","MAO, SU-YAU","9/29/2004 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Arthritis, Connective Tissue and Skin Study Section[ACTS]"," ","1888793","CROFFORD, LESLIE J","Not Applicable","06","INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE","939017877","H1HYA8Z1NTM5","939017877","H1HYA8Z1NTM5","US","38.042307","-84.458748","2793601","UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY","LEXINGTON","KY","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","405260001","UNITED STATES","N","1/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","12/31/2012 12:00:00 AM","846","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIAMS","216000","104760"," ","320760",

Layman's Abstract
The urgent need for new treatments for hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is warranted
because incidence of HCC is increasing considerably in the United States, their dismal
prognosis and the poor response of this cancer to treatment regimen currently available.
This project focuses on the role of the loss of function of miR-122 in the development
and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the most common human
malignancies. Our previous studies have shown downregulation of miR-122 in HCCs of
both human and rodent origin. Now we intend to show that the loss of function of this
liver specific miR plays a causal role in the initiation and progression of HCC. If this is
the case, these studies will open the way to the development of novel miR-122 therapy
for this incurable disease. Thus, establishing role of miR-122 mimetic in an animal
model (in preclinical trial) would be a major milestone in the treatment of this deadly
disease in the near future.","NIDDK","8240491","3/19/2012 12:00:00 AM","PA-08-243","5R01DK088076-03","5","R01","DK","088076","03"," ","SHERKER, AVERELL H","5/17/2010 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2014 12:00:00 AM","Cancer Etiology Study Section[CE]"," ","8254551","GHOSHAL, KALPANA ","Not Applicable","03","PATHOLOGY","832127323","DLWBSLWAJWR1","832127323","DLWBSLWAJWR1","US","40.003166","-83.034278","6218701","OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY","COLUMBUS","OH","SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE","432101016","UNITED STATES","N","4/1/2012 12:00:00 AM","3/31/2013 12:00:00 AM","847","Non-SBIR/STTR","2012"," "," ","NIDDK","205425","107848"," ","313273",
